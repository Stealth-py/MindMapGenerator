completed. We can head over to downloads and notice your here we have the installer package so we can just click on the package. I noticed right away it gives us the Google chrome so we can just,396.17,11.57
"drag and drop it to our applications just that we can have it available. And right now it's saying that it's copping to the applications and we should have it available to us in no time. Now, once",407.75,11.91
"the installation has been completed, you can just close it over here. And if you want, you can just inject the Google chrome and we can just look for it in the application. Let me see where in the applications",419.67,11.98
"I have to go. First of all, let me open this. And once I open it up over here, it's gonna ask me whether I'm okay with this being the application from the web. I'm going to say yes, but I would like to open it as",431.65,12.72
"well as I would right away going to set it up in the dock. So I'm just gonna right click it, Um this is going to keep it in a day. No, also right away. Like to make this a default browser? No. Again, you don't have to",444.37,11.48

"of our work and this would be our file structure. So whether there's gonna be folders, files, or images or anything like that, this is gonna be within this tab over here within the sidebar",651.8,11.25

"as the bug again. We're not gonna cover them right now because we're not going to use them over there. We're gonna be something useful, which is extension, Meaning with every tax that are, you basically have capabilities",674.33,11.61
"of adding more features to a tech center. And we're gonna do that actually in a second. But for now, just remember, these would be basically the extension that you are have available",686.1,11.1
", so, as you can see here, recommended. But for now, you shouldn't have any extensions installed if you obviously just download individual. Now, if you'd like to search for extension again, we can just type",697.37,11.65
"whatever extension we're looking for. And obviously, this is not going to come up with anything. But let's say we're gonna say jobs strip, and this is gonna bring me all kinds of extensions Now, last but not least",709.03,11.38
"regarding visuals to the code, something that we're gonna be in reporting and especially later on, as we're gonna be working more and more with visuals through your code. It's the settings. So",720.41,10.93

"I make the change, the changes that are going to be automatically saved. However, there is also an option for the Jayson object and within Jason Project notice something interesting. So now, these",779.84,11.18
"would be my settings. As you noticed, I changed it from whatever it was initially to, let's say 22. So if I would want to add something else, I'm going to say I don't know that this is the setting for the is going to be something",791.02,11.07
"like 30. Now, in this case, I would need to save it. So I have a few options. Either I can go over here and just look for the file and then check this out, that I can obviously save it, or I would have",802.09,11.2
"to use the shortcut, and that would be commanded again. If you're working on Windows, that probably would be controlled. And that's But since this is a Mac, I'm just going to say that this would be commanded next. Now",813.3,12.22
", in my case again, I'm gonna delete this because I would like to come back to it within a few videos whenever we're gonna make our first majority. But just to let you know that this is",825.52,11.33
"where the settings would be located for visual studio code. Okay, enough of me yapping. Let's start working on our first one now. In order to do that we were going to need a project. Now, in order to create",836.85,12.74
"a project, we just need to create a new folder. And this is obviously a Mac thing. Where or I'm sorry, any operating system thing, It's nothing to do with visual studio code or the actual Web development",849.59,10.95
", but we would need to create a new folder. Now I'm gonna be creating my folder, as you can see in the desktop. But obviously the same thing would work. If you're gonna go to Finder and let's say working documents, I just find",860.86,11.48
"it much more straightforward If I'm gonna be working with all my files and folders on the desktop. And like I said, I was like a folder and obviously I would need to come up with some kind of name. So",872.34,11.77
"let's say that I'm just gonna call the station now. You can call this, however you would like Bobby went to town or whatever. It doesn't really matter. So let me say this, and now I have to look at how we can",884.11,11.27
"get the folder. So there are working projects to individual studio code. The first of all, let me go back to the file. And as you can see, we have multiple options. The first of all, I can just click over here on open folder",895.38,11.63
". And you know what this settings is for now? A little bit annoying. So let me just close this, and here I can click on it unless it's gonna give me an option. So if I go to the desktop, just click in over here, and this will",907.24,11.41

"I obviously was just here a second go last. But not least, there's a very neat feature where we can just drag and drop it. So if I'm gonna grab this project that I have right now, we're folder",941.37,11.56
"or directory called This whatever you would like and just drag and drop it here. And this is gonna do the same thing. Where, as you can see right now, I have my folder available to me and I can start",952.93,12.05
"creating files and folders, maybe within this project folder, and basically get up and running with my project. Alright, Alright, I have the folder. But how do we create our first weapons",964.98,11.54
"? Well, first of all, let me just make this bigger again so we can see everything that's happened now. Second, it's easy to see that everything is in very small phone. And like I said, we will gonna fix this",977.04,10.84
"later. But just to give you an a tip whenever you're working again with visuals to your code, they're gonna have option of zooming in. As you can see right now, if I'm pressing command and plus for minus",987.88,11.67

", we're gonna have to create a file. Now again, we have a few options. As you noticed Yeah, we have a little icon, and when I'm hovering over it, it says that we can create a new file or there's another option",1011.78,12.31
"where we just right click it on the side and again, we have multiple options and what we're in that is new file. Regardless, the result is gonna be exactly the same that we can create a new file",1024.26,11.4

"of h T M L. Now the reason for the email extension, because there's going to be different files there's going to be maybe not. Maybe there's actually going to be assessed files later on. There's gonna be some job script files",1048.26,11.84
"and all kinds of fun. So this tells the browser what type of file this is gonna be now. Second, the index is important because whenever you're gonna download your project or upload",1060.1,11.56

"be different. But the general idea is that we can open up this file in the browser. So how do we do that? Well, first of all, we can just double click where we have an option of right clicking. I notice it says",1190.58,11.75
", Well, open with. Well, since we already set up the Google crime, this is gonna open up as a default browser. But the same way would work if you would have a different browser. If I'm just gonna double click",1202.33,11.17

"and this is going to open up a local development service. And what's really nice about this? Why we would prefer this way instead of the previous one. Well, first of all, the way the course is gonna be setting up",1553.62,11.33
"is I'm gonna set up them side by side. So I'm gonna open up this guy on my visual studio code as well as my coat later. I'm sorry. My, uh, local development server on the",1565.34,10.74
"right hand side, all the changes that we're gonna be doing, we're gonna be able to see right away in our lives. So let's say that I'm first of all gonna close this because it's complaining that we don't have a proper structure",1576.08,11.4
"which we will gonna do in the next video, so don't worry about it. But let's say if I would like to change this back to the helo people, I can just delete whatever I would like to change. And we're going to write the little world",1587.75,11.3
". No. For now, nothing is gonna change because we still don't have the proper syntax for the HMO document. So basically, that has to be structured. However, later on, we're gonna have an option",1599.44,11.17
"where every time we're gonna be making some kind of change, the changes are going to be showing up right away, alive here on the right hand side in our local development server. And trust me in the long",1610.61,11.03
"run that makes our lives much more easier. While we are very happy with our first one page as we should be, it's hard to miss another message by the live server in the very bottom",1621.64,11.49
of the screen. So there has to be something missing in our page. Now that's something is a proper age the email structure. So let's take another quick pit stop in the slide will,1633.13,10.91
"to discuss that you see all H T M L elements follow the same basic structure so that the browser that renders the file knows what to do. At the very top, we have a doc type declaration",1644.17,12.88
". The tells the browser what usually male version the pages written the doctor, If you see in the flight response to the latest version of HD email, which is H. M 05 Next",1657.54,12.02
", we have a email root element that will wrap all our code in the page, and we'll always contain one head element and one body on it. Uh, notice how everything is kind of sandwich",1669.56,12.32
"nested inside a moment. By the way, that is really important. And we'll discuss that in more detail. Once we had back to Texas after the email wrote Element, we have H T M L",1681.88,12.6
"Head element that will contain information about the page like, for example, page title page made of data and links to external resources like C S s, style, sheets",1694.48,11.91
"and jobs. Five content within the head element will not be visible on the page that is being rendered. And with your permission, I would like to hold off on covering head element content",1706.4,12.05
"in any more detail because at this point in time, we have more important business to attend. Insured Head Element will contain information about the page and will not be visible on the page",1718.46,11.57
"that is being rented. Nobody element is whole another ball game because this is where we'll do all of our work. Like adding headings, paragraphs, links and basically creating",1730.03,12.08
"are fantastic webpage. Now that we know the basics page structure, let's implemented in our first Web page. Now that we are big shots and we know the basic email document",1742.11,13.35
"structure that's implemented in our page. First of all, let me just get rid of this heading one, and because we're gonna redo this anyway. And let's start with our doctor. So here are gonna declare what version",1755.46,12.43
"of Asian email we're gonna use. And in our case, that's gonna be html five. You can see right away it gives you suggestions. It's like, Hey, listen, do you want a doctor? I'm sure enough we do",1767.89,12.75
. Again. This is not a cheating. There's nothing wrong with that That will gonna save you a lot of time in the longer we'll have a email wrote element and then let me get all caps and we're gonna write,1780.84,12.14
"each demo now with the National Mail. Remember, we have the moment on within head elements we can right away places. Title again. Title is just gonna be, uh where the title of the page",1792.98,11.76
is going to be displayed. So here we're gonna say first not at first. What page? And then let's go right away to the body and what's right within the body. There's going to be two more things heading one,1804.74,13.07
"is gonna be Hello. My name is John, or whatever name you, Obviously, with the right. Correct. So hello. My name is, uh, John. And then we're gonna right? I don't know, in the paragraph. And",1817.82,12.05
"this is my first webpage. This is my first web. Thanks. Now, once I'm going to save it, nothing is gonna change right now because we still would need to restart the server, because now",1829.87,14.09
we do have the proper actual page structure or document structure. So let me do this. Let me just go over to the port and click on disposing it. Something I can see gonna,1843.96,11.06
"say that server is gonna be online. Okay, fair enough. And then let's go live. So the moment I'm going to go live now, business is gonna be my page with the title here at the very time so I can close",1855.02,11.47
"this tab. And now let's test it out. Whether life servers working properly where we can type something, and the moment we're gonna say with the changes are going to be displayed live in",1866.49,11.07
", uh, life server more into service. Sorry. So let's say and this is my first page, and, uh, it is very good. And let's mention what's here",1877.56,12.89
"and let's say this and sure enough, the moment we save it, notice what happens. So hold on changes. We're being displayed right away here on the last server. So what's happening again is we don't need to",1890.94,12.0
go and refresh because life server is doing for us. So development server is working hard. So we have to work less hard and also like to right away show,1902.94,11.63
"you that we have a death server with the lives we have an option of right away, where we everything we're gonna be working. There's going to be changes this way and forties, we have auto save. So",1914.57,11.49

". However, I do find it a little bit annoying, especially when you start working with things like jobs trip. So I usually have mine went off. Now it's really up to you, whether you would like to prefer to work or",1949.64,12.18
"for this editorial, I always we're going to have my one off. So first I'm gonna make the changes, and then I'm going to save the changes, and then they're only going to be displayed here on the page",1961.83,11.02
". Also, I would like to talk about how the tags are messed up. So as you notice we have the H t email and wrote element, and then we have two Children. And the reason why they're called Children, they're sitting within",1973.24,13.37
this age element. Now. The two Children are ahead element as well as the body on now. It is important to keep the syntax because this will not gonna make sense if you have,1986.61,11.92
"a child within the head element. And then let's say the closing tag of this title is going to be removed and placed. Let's say outside the head on, you always need to follow the structure where if",1998.53,11.88
"you have the element and if you mess something within this element or sandwiches or whatever. However you'd like to call it, it's important that the closing tax also is going to be sitting within the same",2010.41,11.14
"element. Now. The same would work here in the body. If, let's say I would get rid of this closing tax for my heading one and place it, it's on the body or even outside H E mail, it will not",2021.55,11.55
"gonna make sense. So this is something. Also, you should remember about Children and parents. So the parent is going to be the parent element where the child is sick. And as you can see, the child",2033.1,12.16
"can also can have multiple or one other child. So even though the head is the child of Asian email, you can have the child on its own, meaning the title element in this case",2045.26,11.67
"would be the child of the head. No, I know it might sound foreign with Children and parents everything, but just remember, that is important to follow the same tax where if you're placing",2057.06,12.02
"something within the element, make sure that that elements closing tag and opening tax are actually sitting within this element, and the same will go here don't mix, Let's say",2069.17,10.93
"heading one with paragraph. Don't place the closing tax for having one within this program, because again, you're gonna get errors and it will not gonna make sense. Excellent. We know",2080.29,11.31

"M L moments. My first of all, I would like to talk about the world as you noticed, since we have the program and it's quite a long and let's say, if I'm going to be adding more here exclamation marks and I'm",2113.57,11.82
"going to save it, everything is going to be displayed nicely in the page. However, notice what happens with our actual Texas. So now I need to start scrolling left and right. And you can say, Well, you can always",2125.39,11.6
"do amount right, so I can keep zooming out. How are what if we're gonna be adding more? Texas that's not gonna make sense, because then basically, I'm gonna have to make it really small. And first of all, part of the editorial",2136.99,11.26
"is gonna be very hard for you to see as well as in General, whenever you're gonna be working, this is not going to make sense. So what would be the solution? Well, again, we're gonna have to go back to the things I'm going to click",2148.44,11.93
"on a card and then we'll look for the setting of the word. Okay, let me find this. And then you're gonna have this control online should wrap. And here, in this case, we just need to say that this would be on",2160.37,12.37
"so instead of off, then was there before we were just going to go for all. Now what's going to happen again? This is gonna auto save right away, and we can just see that in a text editor right now this is gonna",2173.23,11.49
"wrap the line and again this will you make your life easier because you're not gonna have to stroll left and right as well as email. So now whenever you're gonna have a longer line, this",2184.72,11.63
is just gonna wrap into new one? No. Next I would like to talk about them. It No one in the world is Emmett. You see them? It is something that speeds up your racially amount work. For now,2196.35,12.82
", if you're using different, you can still access them. Now we're in the visual studio code is built in. Now again, if you would like to have a little bit more information about the limit you can head",2209.17,12.95
"over again in the Google and just my payment and you'll see that this is essential toolkit for Web developers where we can quickly, right, bunch of cold. Now there's some things about them it and again",2222.12,11.38
", I wouldn't want to spend a lot of time on that. Our in our most basic example, What's going to happen is that every time I would like to create a moment, I don't have to start",2233.5,11.8
by the angle bracket. I can just say whatever element I would like to rent it. So let's say I'm looking again for heading one. Now is the moment I'm just gonna type h one and the same is gonna be for you,2245.31,11.37
". We're gonna have a suggestion. And as you can see, it says clearly Emmett Abbreviation. So what happens is if, let's say I would like to have having one writing, too. We're heading six. I can just type head like",2256.89,11.52
"H and then we can choose whatever heading we would like. The same would work if I would want to program again. I just need to type whatever name of the element or let's say not the name of the old man, but starting",2268.42,11.71
"letter of the own and is gonna do arrest. Now, if I would like to render that element, I would have to press tab or return. So basically, the and Turkey, the one suppresses notice. Right now, I have",2280.13,12.21
"my own No. Again, this is just the most basic thing that we can do with them and, uh, later on throughout the course. Obviously, we're going to expand our knowledge regarding them majeste on a very basic level",2292.34,12.0
. This is going to save us from again typing and typing and typing and necessary an email where we can just look for whatever element we would like. And right away it's going to be around,2304.46,10.96
". So let's say here, I'm gonna say, this is, um it's paragraph meaning paragraph like with just a P. I notice if I'm gonna save this. Sure enough, I'm gonna have and didn't",2315.92,12.02
"save it first, so no one would notice. I have. This is so this is very cool. Again. If you would like to find out more information, you can just sit over to this, Uh oh. And if you're using a different text",2327.94,13.09
", you should be able to install it as an extension. And we're we're visual to your code. It comes in prebuilt now, last but not least, all this work that we did, we could have done it actually",2341.63,11.67
with a name. So let me the latest and once you're gonna have an exclamation mark. So I'm gonna press shift an exclamation mark a notice again. This is gonna give me that information at the moment we press center notice,2353.3,12.11
"what happens. So now we're getting the proper at Gmail, structured that. We work on the last video. So this pretty much saved this time where we don't have to retire this and again. Please don't",2365.41,11.49
focus on these meta tags. We were going to talk about them once. We already have sufficient knowledge of Asian amount. There's no point right now to fill your head with this information as well as this,2376.9,11.11
language again. What we need to focus right now is the fact of the title that's sending within the head of them and as well as all the work that we're going to do in the body on it. So let me close,2388.01,11.82
". Maybe the Senate for now. As you can see right now, this is still saying Hello. My name is John, but once we're gonna save this, I don't know, uh, proper, uh, structure that's called. Is",2399.83,11.96
this one? Sure. Sure. You can see my typing is just awesome. And you're going to have just a simple heading. One with the title of the page being a document. Excellent,2411.79,13.91
". Well, finally gonna take a deep dive into H T M L components. And our first component is going to be heading. And we obviously have already covered headings because I need to do something with examples",2425.71,11.37
". Pretty much I couldn't have them. MP, So you already a little bit familiar with, but let me go over the whole spiel again. So basically, headings would be titles. So if you think of any kind of document people that have a title",2437.08,11.81
". And for that we have headings. Now, for the headings we have six types starting with heading one and ending with adding six. And obviously having one would be the biggest one, and heading six would be",2449.07,11.31
the smallest. So let's start with having one again. We can use them as obviously and we can have a tab or enter or return. And then here I'm just going to say I am. I am heading,2460.38,11.65
"and we're going to type hitting one now. What I'm gonna do right now is I'm just gonna copy and paste this line, and later on, I'm gonna show you some keyboard, keep its. But for now, we'll gonna be basically doing this",2472.04,11.0
"manually, like we would do normally on a computer, meaning we're gonna do it with copy and paste. Later on, we're going to look at a keyboard shortcuts that we're gonna improve again. I'll workflow tremendously. So",2483.04,11.32
"let me, first of all, copy this. Um, let's say the second line and maybe for this one, let's make it as a heading, too. So it's changed these values as well as this guy. So let me say this. Uh, sure enough",2494.36,11.68
"now I have a heading to. Maybe in this case, I can just copy and paste it again. Two of them right away on one more time. So then I'm gonna have six of them. So here would like to change the values. So this would be heading three",2506.04,11.69
", 24 5 on heading six. Um, the same old steel over here. A lot of not having six, but we'll have any three four. I'm heading six and again, the same old",2518.26,13.54
thing. Like with the rest of the elements that we're gonna have. We're gonna have the element that is in closing angle brackets as well as the closing tax. So whatever is going to go inside between these two,2531.8,11.34
"exact is going to be my heading. So obviously, if you want to write a paragraph, you can write a paragraph in heading Now. I don't know any case where you would want to use that Obviously title His self explanatory",2543.14,12.2
", that title. So depending on how long the titles, you're right. But that is one word too. Or to 10 words. But in general, you probably wouldn't want to have a title that is actually a program. We have specific",2555.34,11.49
"paragraph tax. Now I have just a little bit. But let's say first of all, this is gonna be having three for because I didn't have the numbers. Sorry, I was cheating a little bit. So let me say this. I'm sure enough as you can see right now",2566.83,13.12
", we have six headings. So depending on the situation, obviously you would pick a heading that you would like to use for that particular situation. Hey, guys, just to let you know that starting",2579.95,11.54
"from this video, if we will write any code during the video, if you would like, you can access electrical for that particular video in the zip code in the video resources",2591.49,10.73
". So let's take it out for a spin. Let's say that we're gonna be looking for the heading elements and we would like to get a source code. We can either click it here. As you can see, this would be the resources. Or while",2602.6,10.99
"you're watching the video, let's say, within damages, we can start watching the video, and then we can posit because we don't listen. This guy, um let's just say in the resources we're going to have the availability",2613.59,11.57
"for the images. So this is how we can access the images. In both cases, you're gonna download the Zip folder for that particular lecture. And then as I'm going out to my documents, I'd like",2625.16,11.41
"to go to the download. No, see, I have two zip folders and we can just open up the zip folders and we're looking forward to hold her name. And again, this is gonna work exactly the same for damage. So I'm",2636.57,10.97
"not gonna show you for both of them. But we can just drag and drop it. Or however you would like to open up in your text better. And then if you want to save it, obviously you would need to use it for your downloads",2647.54,10.83
"and then maybe put it in your documents or something like that. But the general sense would be that if you'd like to access the cold that we're right in the video, you can always have access to it in the video",2658.37,10.85
"resources. So far, so good. We have heading covered and now we can move on the program. Now, before we start covering paragraph element, let me just quickly correct myself. I believe",2669.22,11.84
"in the last video. I said components and components. We haven't react united the amount they have elements. So what I meant was heading elements, not having components. So I would like to correct that. First",2681.06,11.85
"and second, I would like to show you that starting from the last video, whenever we're going to do any kind of coating on the video, there's gonna be resources for you. So as they're watching, maybe you'd",2693.19,11.01
"start to understand something you can always go underneath. The research is a video, and you can just download this now, obviously, in the download, what you're gonna have is the same exact thing",2704.2,11.08
"we're doing in the video. So it's not like I'm gonna send you some kind of black magic over here is gonna be the same information we already covered. As you can see, this is going to be a zip file. Now, I already automatically open",2715.28,11.15
"up the zip file and I'm gonna have my index file. No, I don't think I need to go as far as opening the annexation mail to show you that this would be same exact thing. Not for the project. It might be",2726.43,11.39
"a little bit different because already Previously for the previous project. Uh, you know what is underneath the set up video? We have the whole zip file. Where was the starter files as well as the finished",2737.82,11.16
"project. Now, as I'm re recording the course, I might add again folder for each and every video that we're doing. That might be something that i'll do not",2748.98,10.76
"because I wouldn't want to do it, but unfortunately, I have a pretty bad memory, so I might forget, but I Hopefully I'm going to try to remember. So the same would go for the projects as well",2759.74,10.35
". But in general for sure, I'm gonna try to do that with territorial. So everything that we covered in the last video, it should be accessible for you in the resources. Okay, enough of talking about again",2770.48,11.31
about everything else but the actualization email. And now we're getting rid of all the tags since you can have always access in the actual resources. And let's say what we would need for program now for the paragraph,2781.8,12.34
", This is gonna be very straightforward. We have p So that would be a letter p which would reflect a paragraph and again, Same old, same old syntax opening class Total closing tax. Here we can",2794.14,12.71
"write whatever a novel if you would like to do it now again, Like I said, you can still do it. And the and the actual heading But probably paragraph is where you're gonna put your content. So here I can just",2806.85,11.06
"say I don't know some kind of content that I can just keep on typing. And as you can see, since we have the ninth, uh, word break, everything is four months is really nicely, and we can just save it",2817.91,10.72
". And this is gonna be my perfect. However, if we're gonna get over to the browser in the bigger browser window and let's say I'm going to type 1 27 because that is where the local development",2828.86,11.43
"server or live development server is going to set up my indexation. Email not is that everything is sitting correctly like it should, but again here as well. I have the zoom for",2840.29,11.35
"200 again just so we can see better everything. But in the essence, that would be about the program again. It is very straightforward. We would just need paragraph tags and whatever text",2851.64,11.83
is going to be sitting within these tax is going to be displayed as paragraph. I also need to mention the email. Is white space collapse and your probably first question is white space,2863.48,12.84
". What? And what does that mean? Well, what's based collapsing means that email is just getting more extra spaces. Now, it's gonna be easier for me to show you, then talk about for three hours. The first",2876.32,13.0
"of all, let's say that there's going to be heading three that will be on top of the program and then the heading three hours like right, Hello and world decide. That is gonna be better for my website",2889.32,12.37
". I'm gonna add, like I don't know whatever amount of spaces in between now, what do you think is going to be rendered on the right side in the life service and what I'm gonna say this Check this out. All the extra white",2902.07,11.88
"spaces were ignored by email. Now the same would work. If I try to create some space in between the heading three and program again, we can test it out the same way. At the moment, I'm gonna say that nothing",2913.95,12.0
"is gonna change on the right side and not because there's some error or the life service not working, but because of the simple fact that email is ignoring all this white space. Now, the point of this is",2925.95,12.08
"that in the email, if we would like to create spaces in between the elements or within the element, we need to use Special Agent in moments. Now look at them a little bit later, but",2938.04,12.14
"again, if you have been testing it out and if you're confused, why, if you're adding the space in between, I'm working. The reason for that is H T M l Is white space collapsing while we're",2950.18,11.18
"still on the subject of the program, I also would like to cover, dummy. You see, there's gonna be situations where you know that there's gonna be some kind of content, but you don't have the actual contact. And also, as",2961.36,12.46
"you can see in this case, it would also serve me really well. Is that I don't have to type now. How do we can create dummy text email The fastest way are you seeing? Dammit, If I'm gonna type",2973.82,14.9
"Florham, you will notice that I'm getting some kind of command. So how much is gonna press it or your notice? What's going to happen? Basically, we're gonna be getting a dummy text. Laura, I'm hip. Some things now we",2988.75,12.54
"can control how big it is because for now, as you can see as I save this, check this out. So this would be my text and there's a specific amount of work. Alright. Can also control how many words",3001.29,11.2

"in this case, I'm going to use sub element. Where are the first one was up on the second one of the sub. At the moment, I'm gonna say with notice what happened? So I'm having my text, and then everything is gonna be placed within the top",5652.7,12.25

"have to create them somewhere within this program. Yeah, and they can be really anywhere. Just make sure if you would like to have the image suggestion you need to make, like, a little bit of space, As you can see, if I pressed",5713.6,11.35
"baseball and this is going to create a space and now I can write whatever element I would like to have. So since I'm looking forward to strong element, this is where I would like to play something. Okay, I'm just gonna grab whatever",5724.98,12.01
"I was like over here, the three words or the whole Sometimes it doesn't really matter at the moment. We're gonna copy in place that notice that the text that is within strong tax is both",5737.15,12.21
". Now I can cover emphasis, and then we're gonna go a little bit more detail because there's more than meets the eye with these two elements. So let's say again, we're going to pick some words again whatever",5749.84,11.2
"amount awards we would like. So it's a M. So that would send for emphasis. Um, let's say in this case, speak a little bit more words and just stopping pissed. And sure enough, as",5761.05,12.05
"you can see right now, the text that is within the emphasis, uh, element is right now this plate is talent, So it's all the fun. Now the key with these two elements, like",5773.1,12.78
"I said, there's more than meets the eye because we could have achieved is simply using the C. S s. Um, in general, you would always prefer see, assessed just because you want to have all your cells in one",5785.88,11.51
"place and services Asian email just for the structure. You don't want to mix and match them Now. In this case, however, is the fact that women, uh, strong and within them elements emphasis",5797.39,12.47
elements also help us with accessibility. So let's say you have a user who's accessing your project with a screen reader. Then the screen reader is gonna treat this differently,5809.86,12.09
. Let's say whatever is within the strong as well as whatever we have within the emphasis. So that's always You should keep an eye on whatever you're working with strong and emphasis elements. There's gonna,5822.33,10.91
"be some cases where we would like to use special characters, the nation. So maybe let's look at how we can work with them and how we can access first and foremost. Let me get rid of this paragraph. I'm not",5833.24,12.37
"going to need it right now as well as let's create a heading one, maybe. And you know what? I didn't want to delete the body, so let me just, uh, go back. Uh, here, let's say that there is going to be adding",5845.61,11.8

"a lot of wasted time. Just remember that whenever you would be looking for some kind of special character again, you can just Google machine special characters and it's gonna give you tons and tons of options",5919.22,11.12
"as you can place it within your agent amount element. But again, the syntax would be exactly the same. We would have the n percent again, we would know some kind of name or number that we're looking for, and we",5930.62,10.84
"would finish off with a semi colon and then we're gonna have the special character, this plate in our H t m l document. A very useful element in the email is on word list. And",5941.46,12.47

". We would have the honour list element and then each and every element within this list, we're gonna have the l. I element down here we can write whatever would like. So let's say we're just going to have some",5978.07,11.48
"kind of name, and I have right now the list item with this bulletin point shown on the list. Now, if I would like to copy and paste them Let's say I'm gonna create two more. Second one",5989.55,12.63
"is gonna be theater. Um, 31 is gonna be Sarah. I'm gonna have these three list items this place has on order list. Now, the question would be, well, where we're gonna use",6002.18,12.38

"list. Instead of placing some kind of tax, we can place the link. No, again, I'm going to use just feeling more than me and let's write your home. Then let's grab this link and let's just copy",6039.65,13.13
"and paste it within the next two list items. Uh, let's just right over here about as well as I don't know, contact would be our third one. Since we do have the about, maybe we can also write",6052.78,12.66

"of C s s yet. This is where the magic happens when we go to the town. But in general, this would be our navigation where I'm gonna click on it. Obviously, I'm gonna go through the about page",6077.02,12.63
"as well as I have the other links this play that list items within my on order list. Similarly, we can also create more list. So first, let me just delete the list",6089.88,11.7

"the next list. So let me again delete the first and let's create a new. But again, it would work exactly the same way with both of them. So again, the syntax was u l and then within",6151.66,13.55
"the list, we have the list item. And again, let's start first with John, then copy and paste it. Um, the second one is gonna be Peter and sir So our simple on our list",6165.21,11.7
"and sir, but let's say that we would like to add some more specific information about theater and then okay, the fact that he already knows the amount now within the list item. So within the list",6177.5,12.15
"item where we would like to have our next list, we were gonna create either an order list or list on. Okay, so let's switch it up a little bit and have it as a order list. And again, we're gonna have a list",6189.65,11.47
"item. I don't know. Okay, let's say the first one is gonna be email, and let's copy and paste it on. The second one is gonna be the CSIS. So the moment will I'm gonna save our email documents",6201.12,12.2
. We were gonna have John. Then the Peter's gonna have already arrested list where not only has a list item with just the name. We're also gonna have our word list,6213.7,11.45
"within this this time. And this is how this is going to be this place and again, you can get really creative with that if you'd like. But just to let you know that this would also be your options If, in your project, we're gonna",6225.16,11.78
"have to use some kind of table, we also have an option of working with tables. The nation, you know? No, Before we do that, there's always we'll need to get out of this on the list first",6236.94,11.36

"where you said Well, first of all, gonna have to create the table element. And then, obviously, for each and every table, we would have the rose. Um, so? Well, as we would have these columns, right? So in order to",6262.02,11.27
"create a row, we would need to create a role element. And then when the road, this is where we would create our data and again whatever columns who would like to create meaning, if you would want to have",6273.29,11.33
"10,000 columns more, if you'd have four comes, the same thing would work where we would have the table data element and then within the table data. This is where you write our information",6284.65,11.94
"again. Let's just have some kind of dummy text. We have the John. This is going to be my table date. So we are gonna copy and paste it again. Um, let's say the second one would be Peter",6296.9,11.71
". Then again, Sarah and again, four days territorial. I don't see the point of coming up with some kind of exclusive examples. This is just going to give you a general understanding of what's happening",6309.19,11.72
". So the moment table data, I'm gonna be adding meaning the more columns I'm going to be, adding then obviously, the more columns are going to be displayed. Now, we also have an option of having",6321.39,11.19
"the table headings. So in our case, we're gonna have let's say TR. And within the first table row, we have element of Ph, which was time for table",6332.58,11.25

"our most basic type of form. Input that we're gonna have is just a general input. Now, with an input, you're having multiple types you can have. Let's say input. There's an email, but",6486.3,11.24

"basic one, and we have a few more, actually. Now again, Name attribute is going to be used whenever we're collecting the data, because this is something that's going to be shown again, you know? Okay, so we can write whatever",6509.45,11.86
"would like over here, and nothing is gonna change. Now, the idea is going to be used for label, which is I'm gonna show you in a second. But for now, let's say that I would want to save it. And as you can see, right",6521.31,11.31
"now, we're having our first thing. But so I can always think of head over here and type of that was I would like. But nothing has happened. Now, for every element that we're going to have in the form meaning",6532.62,11.8
"the retirement, we also would like to have the submission. And when I said for every meaning for every form out there, you would also want to submit it, right? Otherwise, what good does it make if",6544.42,11.47
"you have the form that you cannot submit Now again, I'm gonna be in our case, we're not going to be collecting the data, but I would still like to create a form, submit elements because you were going to need them later on",6555.89,11.0
"anyway. Now we have two options we can use just a simple button. So let's say we have the mutton and within the button we can write type. And for the type we would have to write something. Now, if you're we using",6566.89,12.39
"the button, then obviously we're gonna write our values in between the button helmet. And if I didn't cover before initial email the button again. But it would be extremely straightforward",6579.28,11.52
", which is right, The name of the elements, which in our case, would be button and then we have multiple types of them. So now, okay, this would be submitted. So as you can see right now, the submit definition. Now",6591.09,11.76
", if you would like to have some kind of space in between them for now, we're going to use the actual line break the later on. As we start working with this, we're gonna see how we can use this",6602.85,10.82
"using the disk. So at the moment I'm going to save it. I'm gonna have my input. I can write whatever I would like to have in my input. And I can start clicking. Submit now, For now, what's happening is the",6613.68,12.1
form is being submitted back to the same page again. This is what happens if we just leave this blank so you can just write some kind of value. I can submit notice we're gonna have our name here,6625.78,11.33
", but again, we're not going to work with this right now, But in general, the form is going to be empty again because we have resubmitted this to the same old page. Now, we also have an option",6637.23,11.47
"of input of submit. So not only the button, but also input. So let me first comment this out. Uh, that's right, that this is going to be important. And for the input, I would like to have again the",6648.71,12.08
"options. So maybe we can just type the input first and notice. If I'm not selecting with them, what kind of important I'm gonna have? I'm gonna have the general text, but here, I'm going to change this",6660.79,12.22
", and I'm gonna say this is not going to be equal to, uh, Texas. It's gonna be equal to the submit. Now, the moment we're going to save it. See, this we have right now are now. This is all working great",6673.04,12.9
and fine. and we're I also would like to see what's happening with the ID. No idea is going to be used for label element so above the input. Let's write that there's gonna be a label,6685.94,11.62
"home and and within the label element, we have the attribute of four now within the four. This is where we are targeting the ID. So in our case, if we know that the idea eventually is",6697.56,11.24
"going to be the name, which is gonna be the value than the moment I'm going to have the four attribute, I'm gonna have to have the same idea that I have a Ford input. They're on target. And let's say here, I'm",6708.8,11.58
"gonna write first name. So this would be in my label now what's happening with the label, then, as I'm clicking on the label notice right now, my input it was gonna be highlighted",6720.38,11.73
". And if I'm going to change this, let's say I'm gonna make a mistake and this is not gonna be name. We can click all day long, and the label is not going to be high with. So that would be the purpose for the label as",6732.65,12.01
well as we have other options. Let's say we can have the perfect so we don't have to work with labels. Although it most cases it doesn't make sense if we're actually implementing the label whenever we're working with,6744.66,11.12
"input. So now let's look at other options that we have for the input. And again, we're not going to cover all of them. But let's look at more popular ones, which would be password an email again, the same",6755.78,11.45
"old deal. We can write input first of all, and then for input. We can either use the eminent where we have just to call in, and then we're picking more. We can just have the general input type",6767.23,10.68
"and then change it. So okay, so it's right that we would be looking for the password. And again we can write the name where we can have two options. So in this case, since we're not going to be using the name actually",6778.11,11.53
", anyway, we're not going to be collecting the data. Maybe let's right above the input that there's gonna be paragraph and that's my password. So again, we're not limited to just using the label. We",6789.73,11.24
"can just use the simple paragraph and we're still gonna have the employee now. Maybe to have it just played a little bit better. Let's have the line break first. So this is gonna be our submit, and then what we're gonna",6800.97,12.17
"have within the password. Now, we have two options. We can either write a placeholder, so it's all right. Uh, password and the place holder is basically going to be displayed just to",6813.14,11.49
"give you a general idea what the user should be typing. However, the moment I'm gonna start typing notice, first of all, the password or the place holder is gonna disappear as well as we",6824.63,10.74
"have a type of password in for our imports are going to be here, so there's gonna be just these little both important Now. I also have an option of the value. So the value",6835.37,12.13
"attribute for input and to show you how the value works again, let's create a new input and we're gonna right first of all line break. And in between these two line breaks, let's create the",6847.51,12.3
"input with an email and maybe, in this case, let's use this. Am I calling or I'm sorry calling and let's say that we're gonna be looking for the input type of email again, Name doesn't really matter for",6859.81,10.63
"us. I d as well if we're not using the label. And also, I need to let you know that not only for the label we can use the ID it's obviously can be used whenever we're working with jobs. That's",6870.44,12.57
"also another option. But I again I digress a little bit. And within the input type of email, we were gonna have to submit the correct email, meaning there has to be an outside if I'm",6883.01,11.34
"going to try to submit something that doesn't make sense. So let's write. Maybe email. Uh, I don't know. Email, email, email. Then, as I'm gonna be clicking, submit notice there's",6894.35,11.47
"just gonna be a little bit of, uh, email validation what it's gonna say. Well, you cannot submit because there's after missing. The At symbol is missing in your input",6905.82,11.59
"type of email, so we are going to write something like some gibberish, like email, uh, at email. This could be an option. So it's the email at email again. This is not going to validate the actual",6917.41,11.57
"correct email, but we will gonna be able to submit right now because we did have this symbol and last within just simple. In protects, I would like to point to you to the",6929.11,11.62
value. So the value attribute is going to allow us to hard code something and that in most cases you would use something like this whenever you would like to have some kind of data already. So let's say,6940.73,11.85
"you're editing something, so there has to be some kind of data that's already being passed on. So let's say in here I could write email at email dot com or something like this, whatever would like",6952.58,11.41
", hear whatever would like to right here within this value. And sure enough, right now, I have already hard coded data. Now the difference between the place holder and hard coded data. At the moment",6963.99,11.27
"you start working with a placeholder, the place all that is going to disappear with the hard coded data. This is already going to stay. So with the value, the value is going to be actually displayed",6975.26,11.29
"now where we could use value. Well, as you can see here we have the input type and the type of submit. But what if I would like to change the text because by default we're having here to submit. So here",6986.93,11.92
"I can just say value. And let's say, uh, submit, please again, whatever we would like to right over here, it doesn't really matter, and then we're gonna save it. Obviously, I'm gonna be",6998.85,11.57
"having the submitted. So these would be the basics of how we can work with input types. And again, we would first need to have some kind of type. And the most employers one was going to be",7010.42,12.05
"text. Then we're gonna have usually name it should be, which we will use only when we are submitting the data. So we're never collecting the data, and then we have an option for the i. D",7022.48,11.74
". Attribute the idea. Actually, we can use the label, or if we're gonna be working the jobs, then for the label, it will allow us to click on the label. And if the ideas",7034.83,11.42
"match with the four, actually, then the form is going to be highlighted with the password. We're gonna have our both in points. So the password is gonna be him for the place holder. Information",7046.25,12.59
"is gonna be before use attacks anything but the moment you start typing, obviously the placeholders and disappear. Now the value is gonna give us the hard coded values",7058.84,10.71
whenever the form is shown regularly. So I can obviously submit this also with hard coded data. But it's still gonna show up right away because I still have my values. And we have two types,7069.65,11.1
"of options of how we can submit the data, whether that would be the input with the type of input, as well as just a button with a type of submit button input elements are",7080.75,11.61
"not the only thing that we can just play within the form. So let's look at the other popular ones. Um, with your permission, I'm just going to continue working with the same file again. If you would like to access",7092.36,11.02
"the resources of the previous video, you can just download resources for the previous video. But after the email and put what was going to look at the few other more popular ones",7103.38,11.26
", No, the first one is gonna be text area where we can have some longer description. Um, you can already see that right away as well. This gives us you actually a good we haven't seen before. Now, first",7115.22,13.07
"one would be columns and the second one is gonna be the roles. So let's say we would like to have some kind of description. Check this out. So again, this is not gonna be styled very nicely right now because",7128.29,11.88
"we have everything all over the place. But let's say that if you would like to have some kind of line break in between them again just for styling, for now, we're gonna have our description. Let's see here",7140.17,11.38
". And maybe we can just have the paragraph of the description. And we can obviously, right. Our description within our detector and columns would mean how many columns? If I'm",7151.83,11.91
"gonna say 40 I'm gonna have 40 columns. If I'm going to say 20 we're gonna have 20 columns and the same thing would go for now. Also, we have the radio buttons and for the radio buttons",7163.74,12.25
". What's unique is that you can have only one value, meaning you can submit one value. That's the whole point of the radio. But now you don't have to specifically do it that way. But that",7175.99,11.57
"would make sense, since they're obviously were designed for that. Okay, let me have the line break just so it's gonna be displayed better. And let's say that we're gonna have a paragraph which ask, uh, please",7187.56,12.28
", we select select our your Hayward coding language. Hopefully, this is written correctly. Once we have our paragraph reinforce what is",7201.01,15.24
"your most favorite quoting language? It's also maybe add a question mark gonna make a little bit more sense. And then we are going to be working with input type of radio. Okay, we can you send my call, nor we can",7216.25,12.32
"just create a basic one and change it. I'm going to use the right away, and here I'm going to have the name and I d No, I'm not going to need any of them for now. Meaning that we're gonna use later on name. But for now, I'm not going",7228.57,12.22
"to use it. Um, let's just write that this is gonna be jobs. So once I'm gonna say would notice, I'm gonna have my radio, but, um, there's gonna be some kind of value now. The thing is, with the radio buttons, the name",7240.79,12.53
"should match because the whole idea behind radio button is the fact is that you would just choose one of them later on you, We're gonna have select boxes where we can pick multiple. But",7253.32,12.03
"if you would like to use radio button, the name of the input should match. Now how this is going to look first of all the copy and paste this Let's say there's gonna be three of them and let's write the second",7265.36,12.12
"one is gonna be our language. And the third one, uh, we're gonna have as Python. Um, now, at the moment I'm gonna save this, I'm going to have an option of choosing one over here, because again",7277.48,14.28
", the idea was would be that if I'm selecting something now, you also would want, as you're submitting it as some kind of value because you not only would want to click on the radio button",7291.76,11.66
", you would like to collect the value. Okay, so we're going to hard code that this is gonna be jobs Now, obviously, value has to match Do whatever you would like to submit. If you would like to submit some kind of John Doe. Hopefully",7303.57,13.46
", you need to write it in the value John Doe. So, in our case for the job, we're gonna write all your job. So this is gonna be my value as well for the price on the copy and paste it and you're gonna",7317.03,12.37
"write paper. I hope you understand the whole purpose of this since you would want to submit this kind of data, whether this is gonna be the job of language, your job, language and",7329.4,11.81
"radio button is going to allow you to choose which one you're submitting. Whoever the value is gonna be the one that's passed on. Whenever we're adding this information to the day, this is",7341.22,11.5
"just showing what the user is picking so again, in our case, we're not using the actual value for now. But it's obviously important to use it later on as you're actually submitting the day. Now, if you mess up",7352.72,11.73
"here with his name, remember the name it should be. All of them needs to match. Because if I'm going to do like this, if I'm going to say that, let's say the second one is going to be not coding. It's gonna be cold in. And if we're gonna",7364.45,11.78
"save it now, the trick here is that I can pick just it and I can pick job and this is not something we would want with radio button, because the whole idea is to use check boxes for",7376.23,11.39
"Okay, So your next question, probably as well. What is check boxes, and how do we start using them? Well, again, we're gonna do the same old deal where we have, first of all, probably some kind of line",7388.5,11.3
"breaks in between, so we can see a little bit better. And let's say again before submit and right after the radio button and the line break, and we're gonna have to get have the input. Now",7399.8,12.95
", in this case, this is gonna be check box. So and we're not looking for radio. This is gonna be check box. And you know what? Right away. Also, let's have the paragraph. And that's right. Uh, the same old deal that",7412.75,11.34
"we had before. So, uh, with your permission, I'm just gonna copy this just so we save a little bit of time as well as you notice, we have type of check box. And now again, we have the same old deal",7424.09,12.02
"where we have the name as well as the valid. So what do you think would a value what we would like to write. I think we can do the same thing. Right? So we have value. First of all, it's gonna be jobs. That's gonna be",7436.7,12.68
"the first thing that's going to be passed on as well as we would need to ride the actual jobs compared. So I'm gonna say, you know what? Okay, So this is gonna be jobs now. The difference with actual check boxes",7449.38,12.42
". His that we can pick multiple. So let's say we're gonna change First of all the name to programming again. This is gonna be your name, okay? I mean, and let me make sure that I read this correctly. And now",7461.98,13.03
"it's copied basis. Let's say 123 And you know what? I did one too many. So let's first of all, change whatever while you have, because I was so we don't want to strip or",7475.01,13.08
"three jobs in our case. Who would want only two? Sorry, we would want only one. And let's change the second one the job. This is also gonna be value of job. Uh, value my",7488.09,13.93
"son. And again I know I'm repeating this, but the values were going to use only when We're submitting data now. You could write whatever you would like Order. How much? Right on. Right over here. Um",7502.02,13.03
", what we have here is the check boxes. Oh, with check boxes, we can click multiple so we can choose. Let's say that our favorite languages are going to be all three of them. So that would be the biggest difference between check",7515.06,12.58
"boxes and the radio buttons. The simple fact that with check boxes we can, like multiple, we can choose multiple, but with the radio. But the whole idea is that you're just choosing",7527.64,11.86
"one. Okay, so we also have an option of select. So select would be something like a drop down menu or something like that. Again. Same old deal right after the python. Let's",7539.5,12.06
"create maybe in this case again, paragraph and the paragraph is gonna same old deal. We're gonna have the same old question, because again, I don't see the point of being really creative during the editorial",7551.56,11.32
"right now, because the most important thing is to understand the general concept and for the select box, this would be different. Where again we create an element and the element is going to be select. And",7562.88,12.41
"here we need to write. Let's say what kind of name it would be. Now we're gonna write again languages. We're just I'll just leave the ID for now. And, uh, you know what? You know what, uh, one",7575.29,12.7
"last thing that I wanted to show you with, uh, check boxes. We also have an option of check. So if we have checked already the check box, let's say, by default, uh, we can add. So",7587.99,12.97
"for this, I'm gonna head over back to it. Say my first one and we have the attribute of checked and we can just leave it like this or we considered equal to check is gonna work exactly the same way",7600.96,11.03

"enough. Now, this is there's gonna be a little more space. So if you want to click something, let's say again we can choose. Um, this is gonna work. So let's say for want to test it a little bit, Let me just write some numbers here. Had something",7728.22,13.14
"to the email. This is gonna work description and something. Let's say from the select is going to be selected a job. And again, we can just submit now in the u. R l. We're gonna see our key",7741.36,14.96

"opinion, this would be more enough to get up and running with it, you know, Now, before we dive into our first station project, I would like to cover two things that I find really important",7790.8,11.12
"regarding whether we're working with jobs, triple working with email or see if and those would be keyboard shortcuts as well as former in our code. Now, let's start with the easiest one, which would be four to making",7802.12,11.94
"our code. So we already know that email is white space collapsing. Right? So if we're gonna right here, let's see paragraph, we're gonna type some text that I'm going to have more space and I'm gonna take more",7814.06,11.8
"text. I'm gonna say with the whole text is gonna be displayed only with this one space. Since everything is collapsed, however, has we're working in the project in our amount or I'm sorry without",7825.86,12.49

"have another one like that, I'm gonna say again, other programs again time some mumbo jumbo gibberish or something like this and yeah, yeah, yeah. What's going to happen again? It's gonna get",7851.48,12.1
"really hard to work now, granted, Right now, I'm obviously doing begin just so we can see everything better in the editorial. But in general, you wouldn't want something like this because it's gonna",7863.59,11.07
"make your life really hard. You are gonna get annoyed really, really quickly. So what would be the solution for this? Well, you can say I mean, jeez, just don't do that. Just delete everything",7874.66,11.5
"and make sure that everything is displayed correctly and that's true. Yes, you could do that. However, there's a better way. There is more automated way where I don't have to worry about what",7886.16,11.37
"I'm doing, meaning whether I'm actually typing everything correctly, we can use the format for that, and in order to get up and running with the formatting, we would need to install another",7897.53,11.38

"else. And here on top search bar, we're gonna write free. And then we're gonna be looking for two teams. They should give us the previous. This is what we're looking for to install. So we're gonna click on this and we'll get",7920.35,12.56
it. Our as we before we installing or right after we install it doesn't really matter. They tell us to use this editor at format on site. So this is something that we,7932.91,12.03

". Hopefully not. It takes for some reason, quite a long time, so hopefully it will gonna be done installing. I'm sure enough it does. So now I can reload my text editor. First",7957.54,12.5
"of all, this is gonna be my first point, then I would like to close. Probably these extensions. We can just go back again to our folder structure. And now let's navigate to the same",7970.04,11.16
". And again, we're gonna have to look for two things. So first one is going to be editor formats on save, so we can just write editor. And you know what? This is not going to give me what I wanted. This probably would work",7981.55,11.65
better here in the Jason object. I just right on save. So this should give us an option. And this is what I was looking for. So we have format on pace and form. I don't say. Now I would,7993.2,13.06
"like to click both of them. Um, again, Since this is gonna auto save, we don't need to save it anywhere else. And now let's go back to our farm. So what's going to happen again? For now, everything is not",8006.26,11.67
"formatted. But let's say again, I'm going to have one more paragraph, so that's great here, Another program. So I'm gonna have the tags and for some reason I can get them. And again, let's write it the same way",8017.93,12.73
"where we're just typing some something that doesn't really make sense. Now, the moment we're going to press, save notice, what happens? So now the visual studio code, Where the help with our extension",8031.05,12.4

"in 11. And by the way, uh, you did need to restart a server because obviously we didn't reload the server, so I did this already behind the same. But if you didn't do it, then",8067.16,11.72
"you're gonna have only two paragraphs shown. So again, you would need to restart the server by going life. And just to make my point across, you should want to have some kind of formatting",8078.89,11.11

"they might seem like a hustle. So you might be like, Well, this does not make sense. I can just use the mouse and you can. But I would suggest incorporating them one by one. Let's say learn one",8126.5,11.28
"of them, and then every time you needed to start using it and then eventually pick it up more and more and you'll see how your work for he is gonna improve dramatically now, first and foremost where",8137.78,11.24

", nobody is expecting you to remember all of them. Obviously, it's impossible. Especially like first day. And I wouldn't suggest memorizing them from for some kind of reason. Instead of like I",8175.08,11.01
"said, I would suggest incorporating the most interesting ones and then one by one, pick it up more. Now, what I'm going to show you is just a few other ones that I'm using",8186.09,11.97
", Uh, maybe the ones that I kind of feel most important ones. I don't know. It's really up to you. You'll see again. You want to use them. Great. I don't want to use them. It's also fine. It's really up",8198.26,11.06
"to you. Now, whenever I'm gonna be talking about the option key, I also can mentioned that this probably would be all I'm pretty sure because as I'm looking right now, my Mac keyboard",8209.32,12.11
", it says option. But I'm quite certain that it would also mean out. Um also like to mention that whenever I'm gonna say command in most cases on the windows. This",8221.43,12.36
"is going to be in control again. I cannot guarantee that. But in most cases, I'm quite sure that this is gonna be the case. Now, let's start with the most basic one, which in fact probably",8233.79,11.9
"has nothing to do with visuals through your cold. But you can still use it here, and that is Command Z, which is for I'm doing something. So let's say I'm going to write something. I'm gonna",8245.69,11.66
"say there's going to be heading one on the head and one is going to be a little world. Now I'm gonna copy and paste the line, which we're going to learn later. Um, you know what? At some point, I'm going to decide that I don't need this",8257.35,12.33
"line, So I'm gonna delete this now. What would happen if I would change my mind again? And if I would want to get a line now, obviously I can create a new one, but the fastest way option would be pressing",8269.68,11.77
"commands. Um, it's pretty much undo is everything that I did last. Now again, we also have an options of command C for copying and command plus for patient",8281.45,12.62
". So Also, those would be the basic ones. And if you want to check some commands, let's say for Eddie. As you can see, you have the undo and the shortcut would be command Z and we have redo again",8294.44,11.16
". That would be shift command Plus and then I have copy, cut, copy and paste. So those are the very basic ones. However, even though they seem basic, trust me undo is gonna save you",8305.61,12.47
"a lot of times whenever you make some kind of message. Now they're interesting. One would be creating multiple cursors. So let's say that I have some kind of, I don't know, text. Um, let me copy",8318.09,12.17
"and paste more lines. Um, if I would decide that you know what? Not only I want to change Hello world to help people on one line. But let's say in all six of them here now what we can",8330.26,11.73
"do is we can hold the option, keep more help, and then, as we're holding it, then start pressing on the different lines. So now I would like to place a card question here",8341.99,12.64
", place the cursor here as well as I would like to place the cursor right here. So now my car, sir, instead of one line is on six months. So what I can do right now is I can just delete",8355.42,11.52
"in the world and then just type whatever I would like because you can see this saves me a time of jumping from one line to another one and then adding, Hello, people. Hello. People have people again. That shortcut",8367.32,11.94
"would be holding the option, plus keep clicking whenever you would like to place the cursor. Obviously, in this case, I would like to place my cursors where I have the end of the work",8379.5,11.74
". But in general again, you can place them anywhere you would like. And I also let's look at how we can select the whole line. That would be an extra. So let's say if I would like to select it on on",8391.72,11.75
"the second line. Now, of course, I can use the mouse and I can do something like this. Or as we're navigating, I could just press command and plus alright notice right away",8403.47,11.68
"I have my line selected. So if I would like to delete it, I can just delete the line, select another one. Okay, Sure, enough. Select another one. So, like the last one, we just move the cursor down as",8415.19,11.58
"well as just the leading going, Uh, now, okay, we're not touching the mouse at all. Once we know how to select on, we can also look at how we can navigate meaning move",8426.77,11.82
"where the words start around. So let's say that we are in the beginning of the line and we would like to move to the end of people. Now, obviously, we have an option of just moving the cursor or",8438.6,11.47
"clicking it with the most. However, we have also an option of holding the option. And then, as we're holding the option, keep, we can move. Either Is that right? Or to the left Notice What",8450.07,12.65
"happens now? I'm moving with the work, not just one. Move the cursor or with the actual amount. So again, this is gonna save you a lot of time whenever you have a big line",8462.72,12.4
. But you would like to move with the words not with actual cursors and stuff like that. And also we have an option of right away moving from the end of the line to the beginning. So if I'm gonna press,8475.51,12.43
"command and again left and right now, moving from the one side of the to the other side of line. Now, also, I can move up and down the whole document. So if I'm going to press command",8487.95,12.86
"up, as you can see right now, we're on the document. And if I'm going to press command, um, down now, going to be in the bottom of the document. Also, where interesting is command",8500.81,13.49
"and D. Where'd you get the same selection? So let's say not only we're gonna have to be heading one, as it was the second heading one. But we're gonna have, let's say, heading too. Hello",8514.3,12.88
", world. And then again, it's copy and paste the line. That's maybe change this to hello, people, people. But in this case, I would like to change the anyone again. Back",8527.19,12.04
to anyone. I'm sorry. Heading two back to heading one Now. What would happen if I would like to select all the heading ones in this case again? Not the heading to in a big in the middle of that has,8539.23,12.08
"the whole world, but only the heading ones. Well, I have an option as you notice as I'm hovering right now with my cursor over to heading one. If I'm going to press to Mandy, then I'm going to select",8551.31,12.29
"what I would like to start selecting. And if I'm gonna keep on pressing command, then now I'm selecting the second one. So now I have two headache ones that I have the third one and then I have the fourth one on",8563.75,12.68
"this case. If I would like to change this to, let's say, heading for I can just change on all of them. And again, this is really powerful. When you have 15 of them or something like that, it really is gonna save you. Think",8576.43,11.09
"now? Also, we have an option of copying facing the same line. Now there's a market for that would be shared options and down. So if I'm keyboard down, So if I'm gonna press",8588.1,13.53
"shift options and then he bore down, check this out. So I have a second line 3rd, 1/4 1 And this is basically how we can do that. Now we can also have an option of moving",8601.63,12.59

six or something like this. Let's say that I would like to move again. They're setting six somewhere here in the middle. Let's say the third line or something like that. No. Obviously we have an option. We can maybe,8627.23,12.23
"select the line. We can cut it out. We can go over here and copy and paste. That is always an option. However, we have a faster way we can hold options and then just press",8639.46,13.36
"keyboard up or down. Now, I'm just moving this heading six up or down. As much as I was wondering, I want to move it out. You can move it out. You want to move it here in the comments, we can move it in the comments and this is really powerful",8652.95,12.47
". And you will gonna use this a lot once you're going to start using the keyboard shortcuts. Also, we have an option of creating the comments. I think we already covered this, though. Remember when I said that we can always",8665.43,11.4
"use the command and forward slash, and this is going to create us to comment so if you would like to write some gibberish over here, sure enough, you can go ahead and do that. Now let me select the line and let's just delete",8676.83,10.96
"the line without touch of the month. Also, if you would like to start a new line somewhere in the middle, let's say that I'm navigating somewhere here and I'm at the end of the hello. However",8687.79,12.12
", I would like to start a new one. Now. One of the options would be again. We can move with the command, press, return or enter, and we're gonna start a new one. However, there's a faster way. This first of all, let",8699.92,12.48
"me I can navigate somewhere in the middle. And if we're gonna press command center in this case, so you need to hold the command, then we're gonna start right away. New line. So again, we wouldn't have to navigate to",8712.4,11.28
"the end. No, There's also an option of changing the short. So if we're gonna hold a man, Okay, plus, then we're gonna press the first time. Come on. Okay, then we're gonna press command",8723.68,12.92
"s This is going to open us the shortcuts, and we can obviously change them So if you would like to change how the short that would be entered, you can obviously do it over here. As you can",8736.6,12.48
"see, this would basically tell you what the shortcut is doing. And you can change this so this would be insured about the shortcuts. And I would suggest at least starting one by",8749.08,12.08
"one using them because they will gonna save you a lot of time. In the long run, I would also like to talk about the external resources. And while we're at it, we're all going to look at the helm",8761.16,11.75
"and and the meta tags that I promised you in the beginning. Now, two really good resources are gonna be Missouri developing network, and the easiest way to search it again with which is",8772.91,11.1

"are already somewhat comfortable with H e mail or any kind of technology because while the documentation is really good, it is also very expensive. So let's say",8795.31,11.4
"First of all, if you would like to go back there. We can always have an option of searching, right. We have an option of searching, let's say email in. Okay, And then we have an option for documentation. In",8806.71,11.8
"our case, we would like to select the email. Then within the email, we need to start navigating to whatever we would like to research. So let's say we're gonna be looking for a male tutorial",8818.51,11.56

"on the left hand side, there, right away. Give you the C. S s. But if in the beginning you just like to understand everything about the email, then this is where you're gonna be doing research. Whether it was gonna be multiple",8842.13,11.89
"India and embedding with the images and email. Or, let's say the element in the email now a little bit more user friendly, especially in the beginning, would",8854.05,12.08
"be WW three schools where again, you just search it in Google for WW three schools. And once we click on it, obviously there's a bunch of editorials available to us? No, again",8866.13,11.69

"is about it. So, like I said, this would be a container for meta data. So data about the actual site and that will be placed within the head element, obviously",8890.04,11.26

"said, um, we're gonna cover Link is gonna be linking to the external stash, and then we have the metal home now in the middle element. You have multiple",8935.13,14.2

"up the live server first and all kinds of things after that. So what's the first? Since we know how to work with Life Server, we would need to open it up again. We have an option of opening up",9210.81,12.17
in multiple ways. So let's say we know that we can right click it and then I have an option of open live service. So I'm just going to click on that and this is going to open up the license,9222.99,11.17
". Well, this is all good, but what's happening is I would like to have to screen so one screen is gonna have the final project. What? I'm going to show you what we're gonna be doing as well as I'm going",9234.75,11.83
"to look at my current project in the bigger browser one. However, as I'm working side by side with my project, I would also like to show you how the project looks saying a small browser window. So what I'm gonna do",9246.58,11.63
"right now, I'm going to open up the new window and which is then let me just make this a little bit smaller. This is really big right now, and I'm gonna again check for one 27th for my",9258.21,11.62
"indexation. Now, in this case, what I'm gonna do is I'm just going to set these on side by side. So as you can see, this would be my project where I'm working. Hopefully, you can see everything correctly. Maybe let me make this one",9269.83,11.96
"a little bit smaller. And then this is where we're gonna be doing most of our work. This is the small browser window, so you can see exactly of what everything is happening. And then this would be a bigger",9281.79,11.44
"president. Well, that would be initial set. Now, also, the right to right away create my folder. We're gonna be placing our images. So let's say you folder and I'm going to name my folder images",9293.23,13.13
. So this would be our basic structure for the project. And now we can ready to go and start importing our images. Alrighty. We have our product structure. So what,9306.84,11.56
"next? Now, as we're checking the project, we can see that there's gonna be a few images and as a side note, if you don't want to download images in this video, I mean the resources you're actually going to",9318.4,11.49
"be able to find the whole project with all the images that we're gonna be using anyway. Now, for the logo, it is very simply, I went to Google and just search for a copy cup, uh",9329.89,11.74
", logo to star in the background. And then I would say there's many wants to pick, and I just picked this one. Now, please understand that this is not something that Children do for the production, uh, project",9341.63,11.84
", but now, Okay, so this is just a simple project. We can just do it this way for the local. So in this case, what I would do is I would just say that I would like to get damage, so I'm gonna say, save him a jazz and",9353.47,11.89
"I'm going to be looking for desktops. And this is where the project is, and then within the images, I'm gonna say that I would like to save this as a logo, and either we can at the end of ourselves",9365.36,11.15
", or we can just go with whatever extension that they give us. So this would be the local. Okay, After the logo, we also have one big background image as well as three smaller ones",9376.51,11.96
". So these would be, I don't know again. For the house plans or French rose, it doesn't really matter. The main idea would be one big macaron image and then three smaller ones. So these images",9388.73,11.7
"I got again in the pixels, the ones that I was telling you before, where you can get nice copy, right free images. And again if we just start searching where if you search for a copy first",9400.43,11.41
"off the one here and coffee and as we start scrolling down, you can see that there's gonna be quite a few of them that we're using. Uh, let's start with this guy, since this is gonna be a background. So",9411.84,11.82
"let's say here again, saving jazz, and I'm just gonna call this background and again, let's just go with whatever extension they give us now. After that, we have house blend, and",9423.66,12.08
"I believe for the house. Bland, uh, scroll down. See where I have this. Uh, no. This guy. Uh, Let's see. Let's see. Let's see which one That I picked this one. So let's say what's",9435.74,15.56
"name? This house? London. Then what else we have? We have French roast would be looking for this guy. And what I have this one here is, uh, saving. This would be French",9451.3,17.35
"Rose rose, and the last one is going to be, I think Colombian I'm being roast. Um, that's gonna be weird. And the machine. So it said that this is gonna be Colombian in",9469.73,15.33
"the Rose. Now, I have these four images, one for the background and three smaller ones. And for the smaller ones again, I use the option in the Mac where we can just crop them a little bit. So",9485.06,12.26
"let's say that I was gonna select first of all, three of them. But again, not background, not logo. Just these three, and then I'm gonna open it in the preview. And within the preview, I would, like, select",9497.32,11.35
"all of them. So again, the short cut with the command day. So as you noticed, right now all the images have been selected, and then we can look for the tools and and we're just in the side. Not in my case. I'm going to click",9508.67,11.84
"on this little padlock, So now they're going to be adjusted exactly like I want, not the height adjusted to death. Um, let's say that I was going to be looking for 320 by 240",9520.52,11.92
". Um, yeah. Once we do that, these are gonna be our images and everything is set and ready to go so we can start working on our project. And once we have our images, we can start working on",9532.92,10.8
"the project and actually start doing some kind of h t M l. Now, as you can see, we need to start by getting the local first. Then we're gonna have the heading three, and then we're gonna have our little",9543.72,11.45
"number. Now, this is the first thing that I would like to do, and then we're gonna start moving on and working with different sections of the project. Well, first of all, we would like to get an image. So we already know",9555.17,11.91
that we would need to use the industry. So here within the body might just start getting damage. And for the image we're gonna be looking for the source or are also I'm in right away. Then we're gonna give us source,9567.08,12.36
"and within the source. Now, we would need to navigate to the images folder. Now, we know that we would need to use the relative path. And maybe I didn't mention this before, but you're also going to see a lot of times is",9579.82,10.65
"done. So again, this that would mean the same thing where we are navigating somewhere within the folder, meaning the index right now. And images are still within the same hold",9590.47,11.35
". However, the image that we're looking for is in the images folder. So first, we would need to never get still within this folder and look for the images folder. And once we get the images folder",9602.31,11.33
", what's gonna be next? Well, then we're gonna be looking for the local, right? So, as you can see right now, we're getting along and let's just right here. Uh, coffee, coffee, local. Um, yeah. Now we have our image",9613.79,13.37
"So this is all good. Next, what we have after damage, we have some kind of heading. Now, In my case, I used I believe, having three. I'm gonna say heading three is gonna call this. This is",9627.42,13.01
"gonna be the name of the company or website or whatever you would like to make it. And in this case, I'm gonna say coffee. Unless we would need to create our number. No, for not. But I",9640.43,11.84
"said that we would be using an order list the first we need to create the list. Then for every list, I don't We know that we need to create a list item element. And then with the This is where we're",9652.27,13.29
"creating our like, no, forever your link. We're gonna have to have the hr and basically the past or direction. Where do you think is going to be going? Um, since we're gonna start with the home page and say that the",9665.56,12.06
"home page is going to be going through an email now, obviously we haven't created yet the rest of the pages. However, it doesn't stop us from creating these links. So what I would like to do right now is just topping",9677.62,12.35
"pay this three times. And instead of having this as a home, um, I'm going to change it to about numbers and contact. So first of all, let me again do multiple customers. So",9689.97,12.02
"now that we would need to use out for that. So in this case, if I'm going to press, um, multiple places notice I'm gonna be having multiple cars. So let me delete First of all, home organization, every",9701.99,11.69
"one of them is gonna be different as well. Let me get rid of all the indexes at the same time, I'm just like that. We got rid of all the next. And let's say the second page is going to be involved in, um, the name",9713.68,12.93
"in our, uh, number is going to be about. Now, let me say this. Let's see Sure enough, we have the about and then let's have the numbers numbers. This email, this is gonna be a page, and",9727.0,13.42
in the number we're gonna have numbers. But at least we're looking for contact. Interesting. Now. And this was going to be equal in the number to contact. Just contact. I'm not gonna have anything,9740.43,12.75
else. Good. We added local we added heading three as well as our number and maybe just a general check. We can go to the bigger browser we know and let's see how this is going to look like. I think,9753.18,11.76
"it looks good enough and we already move on. Are working the next part of our project right after the logo. On the number, we have the big background image as",9764.94,11.24
well as we have feature product where there's gonna be three products the house bland French rose as well as Colombian role. And each of them is going to have some kind of link that will gonna,9776.18,12.33
"go to the commedia. And as you can see, it's gonna open up in the new time. Now, at the very end, we're gonna have here this whole paragraph with the copy, right? Remember the special relation email",9788.51,11.3
"character and then back to the topic. So first of all, let's start working on all this. So let's say this right after the obligation mark or number, we would like to get our first big",9799.81,12.02
"image. So how do we do that? Well, first of all, we would need to get the name is right, so I'm gonna say M G. And now we're looking for the source. And again, we need to navigate to the images folder and then we're gonna have our",9811.84,11.84
"big background. Now, what else can we adhere? Well, let's say first that we would like that. Hold on a 56 Let's say coffee beads. This is gonna be method as you notice. Right now, the images",9823.68,13.17
"obviously big. We didn't adjust anything. And also, let's check it out in the bigger browser window. Just so how it looks now. As you can see, there's two issues right now. So for the smaller screen now",9836.85,12.79
", the damage is way too big. How we're on a bigger screen. It's not big enough. Basically not spanning all across. No, in order to fix is usually would work with. However, in our case, since",9849.64,12.72
"we haven't looked at the C s s, we can do a tiny, tiny little trick where remember we had the with and then previously we worked with with only with pixels when we",9862.36,11.74
"were actually adding, let's say, 100 pixels here or something like this. We also have an option of using the percentages. So instead of using pixels, I'm gonna have the 100%. And what happens right now",9874.1,11.53
the image is actually responsible. So now it is on the small screen. The image is exactly big enough for the whole screen instead of standing outside of the screen and,9885.63,11.9
"for the big screen notice. No, it's actually standing all across. So essentially, what we did is we made this image responses again. Normally, we're gonna do this within the CSF",9897.53,11.88
", but again, just because it's a little bit annoying I just added, here this whatever two lines of code or uh, with actually basically okay, now what we have next. Well, let's maybe",9909.79,11.82
"created next a line break, just so there's some space in between. And then I would like to start by placing heading one. I'm gonna say, Hey, go on. And he was featured insured",9921.61,12.89
". Um, let's say product. So this is gonna be my head in now, after the heading one again, let's add another line break and maybe right after the line break, let's start using the comments since there's",9934.53,12.05
"gonna be three features project and all of them are going to be their own product. So I would like to have some kind of distinction of what is in there. So let's say first, this is gonna be the house plan",9946.58,11.23
". And for the husband, we'll start by heading too. So we're gonna have to get into right here and let's say House Bland and we're gonna be looking for the coffee. Let me say this. Um",9958.89,11.7
", this is what I have here on the right hand side. Okay, moving on. I would like to place an image. I'm gonna say image again. We're gonna be looking for the source of damages. And now we have to look for the house",9970.62,11.91
"Now. What else? Well, we can always have the house blend like this and say that there's going to be alternative text. So if the images is not available or we can have this place, then there's going to",9983.38,11.71
"be alternative. No, this is gonna be my image. Know what else? Well, I would like to have the program. Let's say for the paragraph there's gonna be a text off. I don't know. 25 words, 50 words. It doesn't",9995.09,12.91
"really matter. You can just have some kind of at the moment. I'm gonna save this. This is gonna look nice on the small screen, right? As you can see right now, however, the issue is on a bigger screen. It is really annoying",10008.0,12.91
"if I see these lines like again, this is something we were going to do with the assessed. But just because it does annoy me hell of a lot. What I'm gonna do is I'm gonna have a new attribute that",10020.92,11.49
"we haven't covered that yet. And that is the style, actually. Again, you're not gonna use this later on once you learn to yourself. But for now, this is going to help us a little bit. So within the C s s, this is basically",10032.41,11.99
"in line and again, you don't need to remember this property. You're gonna learn it later on within the C s s anyway. But here I can just say with property and I'm gonna set it equal to 50%",10044.41,11.58
". I'm gonna say he close to 50% again. Please don't worry about the syntax. For now, we're gonna cover this. This is a very, very basic C SSN tax. But it was it was going to help us, though",10056.4,12.49
", because now I have my paragraph expanding 50% and it's gonna look much more better on the biggest screen again. It's really up to you. You can just skip this style, not tribute",10069.03,11.7
"and just having a normal program. But I'm just gonna choose choose to do it this way, then last but not least, there's going to be some type of link I'm gonna say, heading three and within heading three. I would",10080.8,11.82
"like to have the link now for the link again. We're gonna have to use some kind of match tribute, meaning the HR attribute where this link is going to be going. In our case, we can either copy",10092.62,11.25
"and paste it from the U. R L after research for computer More. Since I know that this is gonna be my you're out. I can ride at P s then to forward slashes, then WW",10103.87,12.2
", and we're looking for a week. Pedia org dot org. And then let's have another forward. However, since I would like to open this up in the new tab, meaning I wouldn't want the",10116.36,13.49
user to navigate away from our page. Can I have a target that tribute instead of equal to underscore black? And let's call this details so this would be the name of doing now. Once,10129.85,12.87
"we save it, what do we have? So we have our house blend, and then we have also the details. So if we're going to click on the link, let's check it out. Well, for now, what's happening is that this is navigating",10142.72,13.07
"away from our page. And the reason for that is, as you can see, I have a very small but at the end of the day, very important there because this is not a target. That should be target. As you",10155.79,12.23
"can see how easy it is to make, actually, mistake. Let me get back. Maybe let me refresh just to make sure that everything is working. Correct. And now we're opening up, obviously, in the correct recipe",10168.02,11.47
". Now, if you want to go any, maybe further, you can write coffee. So maybe let's search in the media for coffee, and then you're gonna have a different you are out. So maybe if you really like you can just copy",10180.0,11.24
and paste this u R l where you're gonna be for the coffee now. I'm not gonna do that. I'm just gonna leave my general the computer. But if you would like to do that. I just need to copy and paste this. You are okay,10191.24,12.55
", So, So far, so good. So we have our first, uh, product, the first feature price? No, that's what I would like to do is just copy and paste it, because there's gonna be three of them. However, I don't see the point",10204.2,11.95
"of rewriting everything from the scratch if we can just copy and paste and create two more. Okay, I'm gonna say coffee, and we're gonna copy and paste. So this is gonna be our I believe French Rose",10216.15,11.45
". And the last one is gonna be, uh, Colombian. No, once we are done with copy, then we just need to start changing the value. So obviously here, we're not going to be looking for the house blend",10227.87,12.62
". Gonna be French roast, then also the images. We're gonna have to be different. So let's say that not a house coffee, Right, Rose, as well as remember image",10241.2,13.79
". Okay, let me look forward images and when images, we have the French rose. Unless the least we have the alternative attribute. And yes, Okay, that would be our second one. And the last",10255.4,14.13
"one, the third, but not the least one is going to be a Colombian. But remember, we can just keep this. However we would like, uh, meaning we can keep the link the same way. But",10269.53,11.53
you know what? I would like to have the maybe two more line breaks after the end of the each of the items because I think it's just gonna make a little bit more sense if they're going to be separated,10281.06,11.87
"a little bit. So let me grab these two hours here as well. Uh, where we have the end. I think it's right here. Copy these guys as well as at the end of the third link. Also, just",10292.93,12.34
"gonna have the line. You know, like I said, we still need to change this Colombian. So Colombian being a rose. Uh, you know what? I can just maybe copy and paste this. Maybe it's gonna",10305.27,15.29
"be a little bit faster. Let me delete title. Then we're also going to be looking for damage and then another forward slash, Um, enough. We have Colombian. Um, yeah, I think the last",10320.56,13.02
"thing just would be changing this alternative. Now, what is that? The very, very end of our home page. That would be our simple paragraph. And let me show you again. Maybe",10333.58,11.47
"we already forgot what you had. And by the way, we can see right now how old are page would look like on the bigger brother window. But at the very bottom we have our copy, right? 2019",10345.05,12.16
"link back to the top. Okay, Now for the link back to the top, maybe a little bit more line breaks here just because it's gonna look a little bit better. And then here, we're gonna",10357.94,11.52
"have the paragraph within the paragraph. There's gonna be copy, right? Text. We save this and show you this is where we typing the program. And then again, let's use the special character",10369.46,12.04
"notice. Or remember, it was the n percent, then the name of it. And in our case, that was copy. And let's just say the year, which would be 2019. Now, if you're watching",10381.66,11.44
"this in the future, let's say 2000. Whatever, obviously, right? Whatever year you are currently at. And last but not least, we're gonna be looking forward to having having three. That",10393.1,11.44
"we are going to include the link back to the top. Now for the link again, we're gonna have to have the address. And then here we would need to navigate to a local. So somewhere at the very top",10404.54,11.63
", we're gonna have to create an ID or element with some kind of idea that's going to match local. And here, let's just right back to to This is gonna be my text. No, it's happening",10416.41,13.36
"right now is we don't have anything here that has the logo. I'm sorry, That idea of local. So what I would like to do right now is for my image, my local image. I'm",10429.77,11.41
"just gonna have the ID, and we're gonna send the sequel to Logo. No moment. We're gonna save this. Check this out. I'm gonna lower, and we're gonna click on it. We will gonna",10441.18,12.16
"scroll all the way to the top. So we're going to navigate to the top of the page and yeah, we maybe should just check it out in a bigger president to make sure that everything is working back to the top",10453.34,12.04
"is fine. And now I can start working on our page. Awesome. We have successfully created our first home page. However, we have a few more pages to go and",10465.39,11.69
"the next one would be developing. Now, before we start doing anything before we start creating the file or anything like that, let's just check it out. What would be the common things between the home bridge",10477.08,11.29
"as well as the above it? So if I'm going to open up the about page in the final project notice again, logo is gonna be here. We're also gonna have our headings as well as our navigation",10488.57,12.27
"and then the big background image. Now I keep calling this the background image. Of course, this is just one big image. But later on, as we're working with the assessed, we're gonna be setting this up as",10501.11,11.14
"a background image. So my apologies. For now, it's just one big image. But I keep referring to has one big background. No, we also gonna have one. Well, then there's going to be specific",10512.25,11.75
"text for the page. But then the footer, as well as link back to the top, is gonna stay the same. So we have two options. Either we can create a new file and start creating everything",10524.0,12.29
"from the scratch or we can just copy and paste everything that we have in the indexation email and delete unnecessary stuff. Now, let's say first, I would like to create a new file. And",10536.29,11.79
let's call this about email again. This would be in the HMO page. We need to use the agent email extension now within the file. I would like a copy and paste everything that I have here. So,10548.08,11.75
"I'm gonna select everything with command A Then we're gonna copy this by with command C as well as last but not least, was like this with command. And now I have",10559.83,12.64
"my index page in my about it. However, this is where we're gonna start making changes. So first for the title, maybe Let's write that about page or just in general about as",10572.47,12.91
"well as Florida heading. I would like to change it from coffee junkie to about now. What else? Well, payment is going to stay right. However, the feature product is going to be about us",10585.38,12.31
", so the text year is gonna be about instead of feature. Now here, we're gonna start deleting everything. So I would like to delete all these featured items so everything's starting from the house blend",10598.2,12.89
"and ending with Colombian roast. I'm just going to delete this. So first of all, we can save this. Um, let's see what we're gonna have. No, this is gonna be my home page. However, now I can navigate to my about page",10611.31,11.48
"and what we have is the local, the navigation, like we wanted to as well as the big image. And then we have just from hearing with about us and the",10623.1,11.96
"very bottom, we have the paragraph we have copy, right, and link back to the job. So all this is working now, the last thing that we would want in the about page it just to have the program",10635.06,12.55
"would, let's say 500 words. So we're gonna create April tags and we're gonna paste, uh, or you know what's not based. We obviously need to look for damage. So we have Lauren 500 then",10647.88,11.82
"we're looking for 500 words. Now, the moment we're gonna save these are gonna be a 500 words. And again, there's always we can check it out how it looks like in the bigger browser window. So this for now",10659.7,11.5
"would be the logo. I mean, sorry, Index page, This is an email. And then as we have our or has we navigate to invalidation email, then we're gonna have our heading with",10671.2,11.94
"are big and successfully. We also have created our about page. Before we start working on number page, let me just make a quick correction. We're here at the very",10683.14,12.48
"top. Instead of having this heading three years in about, I would still like to leave. This has a coffee junkie, cause I think this is gonna be the name of a project or page or the company. So",10695.62,11.8
"I just keep this country junkie as well as let's write the title with a capital A, um, as we saved. Right now, everything is working fine. Now let's decide what's happening within",10707.42,11.43

"see. I have to Z folders. Now we can just open up the zip holders and we're looking forward to folder name and again, this is gonna work exactly the same for damage, so I'm not going to show you from both of them. But",12271.41,11.25
"we can just drag and drop it, or how you would like to open up in your text better now if you want to save it, Obviously you would need to use it for your downloads and then maybe put it in your documents or something",12282.66,10.95
"like that. But the general sense would be that if we'd like to access the cold that we write in the video, you can always have access to it in the video. Resource is I know what some of you are probably",12293.61,11.56
"thinking. No. Okay, smart guy. You just show us how to use in line CSS and then spend next five minutes trashing it. So what is the better option? Well, we have the internal ceases. So",12305.17,12.58
"first of all, let me get rid of these style attributes. I'm not gonna need it right now. And let's say there's gonna be heading one on just for kicks. Let's add a few more. Let's say that I'm gonna have three hello worlds with heading",12317.75,11.61
"one. And then I was just gonna have one lonely one be heading to now. How do we have the internal CSS? Well, we're gonna have to head over to the head tags and again that is important. Leased them, place them somewhere",12329.36,12.22
"else, and then expect them to work and then within the head tags, we would need to create another tack. Now, that would be the style attack. Again, we're gonna create two sets of tags the starting",12341.58,12.76
"one and the closing one. And then we write our CSS within these tax. Now, how that would work again. We're gonna start with selector and again, Please don't get hang up right now on the syntax we're gonna cover",12354.34,12.97
"and literally and a few videos. Well, let's say I would want to start with old heading ones. So I'm going to say all the heading ones are gonna have some kind of styles now again. Like I said, I was gonna go with color because",12367.31,11.45
"that is just gonna be these everyone on. Let's just go with blue. So my color is going to be blue as well as I would like to add farm size. And again, let's go with something like three rum's. So in order",12378.77,11.9
"something else now, I don't have to jump back and forth with my HTML and add for every kind of style On that way, all of my heading ones have been styled, right? Were literally",12390.67,11.44
like what? 123 and four lines of code and I can add whatever styles I would like over here and all my heading ones are gonna be stopped If I want heading to. I can just say heading to,12402.11,12.3
"on. Then let's say again, we're gonna use color color's gonna be read and not read, Olive. But actually read on, let's have fun size to be really small. Ah, that would be it on no 0.5",12414.84,12.64
"volumes. Something like this. So now my heading to is gonna be very small. We have color red, and if I'm gonna have more heading twos, the same thing is gonna happen to them. And again, you can see",12427.48,13.0
"how much more powerful this is already because we don't have to first of all, clog up our HTML. So I didn't need to Anything here. I can clearly see what kind of structure I have as",12440.48,12.37
"well as the only changes were making are gonna be instantly added to all of them. Now, let's say I'm gonna change my mind. I'm going to say, you know what? I don't like the color blue, so let's say we're gonna go with chocolate so",12452.85,12.53
"instantly. All my heading ones are going to get this stop. So internal ceases is way, way more powerful than jumping throughout the actual components that we have. I'm sorry",12465.38,11.42
", not components the elements that we have any female on, adding them the in line styles. So far, so good. We know what is the on line sensors as well the internal sensors",12476.8,11.9
". However, there is also a tiny issue with internal CSS. Now, what would be the issue? Well, we're lacking flexibility for multiple pages on. I think it's gonna be easier",12489.14,11.89
"for me to show you then again to talk about it for, let's say, half an hour. First of all, we need to create another page on. I'm going to say there's gonna be new file and we'll call this page about HTML",12501.03,11.42
"and again, we're gonna have to get some kind of structure. So I'm going to say that first of all, I would like to get the basic Asian infrastructure, So I mean, really this on Let's say that we're gonna be looking for again some kind of",12512.7,11.5
"reading ones. Well, say heading one on, we can do the same thing. Hello, world. Um, let's copy and paste it on. Maybe let's also add heading to Just so we're staying consistent? No. Here we're",12524.2,12.4
"gonna say how little people just like we did before. Analysts copy. Let's say three lines over here. First of all, I would obviously like to see Oh, my about page is gonna look like. And here maybe let's have another title",12536.6,12.45
. Just so we know that this is gonna be about page on which right? An entitled This is an about page on. You know what? Let's also right away. Set up the link is that way we can navigate it much more easier,12549.44,11.61
". So I'm gonna say somewhere within my hand, expressions to indexation email all the way and a top We're going to say that there is going to be a link. The link is gonna goto about Index page or about HTML",12561.44,11.39
"page. And let's just say about Paige now, I can do the same link in the about page just that we can navigate back, so I'm gonna head over to my belt age. And instead of abolishing",12572.83,12.25
"the male rows, they're gonna write indexation email on Let's just change this to a homepage. So again, we're just setting up a easy navigation just so we don't have to deal with whatever taps",12585.09,11.53
"here. So let's say here, we're gonna get rid of this. We're going to save it. And now I have my about page link. Now, if I had over to about Page, what do I see? Well, I see that there is pretty much three having",12596.62,12.54
"one's on, then heading to. But obviously all of them are not stopped, so I would have to stop. Well, the easy Where would be well, I mean, it's very simple. We're just gonna grab the style tags. We're gonna copy",12609.16,13.82
"and paste them here on. We're gonna say that somewhere again, within the head element within the about page, we're gonna copy and paste them. Sure enough, I have my stuff. So everything is working really nice. But let's",12622.98,13.17

"really good. Look good. So it's safe. We're gonna head over to my home page. I'm going to say you know what? I would like to change this, and I would like to change this to Green again. No specific reason. This is just how I feel",12649.31,11.81

"within this page were obviously styling and has a chocolate. So that is probably an issue. I mean, changing one color is no big deal. They imagine that in general, with your styles",12687.03,12.89

"them or do something like this. Now, again, that doesn't sound very productive to me. So there has to be a better option, Okay, in order to show you the better option. First of all, let's get rid of these styles we don't need them",12723.98,11.97
"for now is gonna get rid of the internal CSS now within the about page as well as the index bridge. So let's say we're gonna have no internal CSS. So I'm just gonna go again, back to the basic",12735.95,12.21

"works we would see assess. So here, if I'm going to say let's say, Stiles says. And again, you can name this Bobby CSS doesn't really matter. There's just some conventions where you say main",12771.39,11.05
CIA service or style. CIA says something that would actually reflect that this is something to do with styles. But the most important thing is here to see assess extension. You always always need to have,12782.44,11.15
"it if you want to use it. The CSS Now here again, we can write the styles. Now again, let's remember what we had. So let's say anyone on before heading one. Let's have just a simple color on Let's",12793.59,12.45
"look for some kind of color so I could go with I don't know Crimson something like this. So I'm not gonna add in a more fun sized. I think it's we already have covered this, but let's say",12806.04,11.71
"for having three. And when I say cover this, I mean we don't need to add it right now. We're gonna cover the syntax. That doesn't mean that I'm not gonna cover what is the font size just as a side note. And let's say for heading",12817.76,11.72
"to move and add another color. It's a color, and I'm gonna look this time for you, so I'm going to save the file on surprise. Surprise. Nothing happens, you might be wondering. Well, this dude doesn't know",12829.48,13.32
what he's talking about. We just had a perfectly working CSS. And now he just ruined everything. He deleted it. He created some funky CSS style on. Nothing has worked. Well,12842.8,12.45
", please, just wait. If we're gonna head over to indexation email and again within the head element, please don't place it somewhere else within the hell it Helmand. We're gonna have to create a",12855.84,12.2
"link now with them. It if I just type a link. Noticed. I'm getting all these options here. So what I can do is Aiken like to see assessment, which is gonna give me a ride away? Everything that I'm looking for now it",12868.04,12.29
"might be funky sometimes if you have multiple actual files. So big here. Careful, it's going to give you something automatically. So again, let me head over back with Command Z. So",12880.33,11.11
"I'm do what we just did on instead of maybe CSS. We can just look for basic link, So let me again get me up. Suggestions on within the link notice. We're getting the link tag now. The link that is not",12891.44,11.72
"gonna have a closing tax. How are we were getting this relationship attributes on this is gonna point to the statute. So we're saying we would want to link this page to establish it. Now, this is where",12903.16,13.74
"we would need to go with the path. And again, we have covered this already in HTML, where we can have, let's say, the simple bath and just say style CSS war. We can obviously adhere",12916.9,11.24
"the dot and work slash And again, this is where we're looking within the folder. Now, up to this point, it's not gonna matter which one you're used. Like I said before, later on, as you're using the react or node, this",12928.23,11.53
"will gonna matter. So you might as well get used to it right away. The actual relative paths. But anyway, let's just stay with a simple example on Let's say we're looking for style. See assist. No, que",12939.76,12.09
"So I'm looking right now and I don't see anything. The reason why I don't see anything that if I'm actually in the index page where I'm sorry, the belt page. I'm obviously not gonna be able to see that, however, if",12952.34,11.52
"I'm gonna click on the index page, so I'm currently at the index page. Check this out. So have all my style's red, for one as well is. I mean, it's annoying. Probably. So this",12963.86,11.92
was probably a bad choice. What's pick another color? Let's say that we're gonna be looking for this guy. Maybe this is gonna be a little bit friendlier through I. And now we have this cat it blue for my heading to. Okay,12975.78,13.6
", so this is already a good start. Now, what about the about page? No, we would have to do with same thing we've had over back to the about page. I'm gonna create a link. Now, again, this link is gonna have to be",12989.39,12.0
"the actual element. We have a relationship attribute that gonna have the value of passion as well as the entry of attributes we have where this is located. And remember, whenever",13001.53,13.18
we were working with links were also using this pastry factory. Check this out just like this here. So the same way would work over here again. We're gonna point to the same thing. And I'm sorry. Not main CIA says,13014.71,11.88
"but style CSS. So once we save it, notice what happens. So if I'm gonna go to a about page, what do you think I'm gonna have or you, um if we're working where I'm sorry for looking",13026.59,12.66
"at this correctly, we noticed that both of them are exactly the same. So we have been successful. Now. What does that mean to us? Well, that means that if I'm gonna go here back to the styles CSS. And if I'm",13039.26,12.32
"gonna change this and let's say if I'm gonna go back toe, I don't know, like, regular herbal color on both pages, not only the about page, but also the homepage. These styles are gonna work",13051.58,11.76
so you can see already how much port more productive. This is where we can right away work with multiple pages. Again. Let's have maybe a font size. It's a phone size on. Let's,13063.73,11.36
"say this is gonna be 4 g and right away on both pages and again for the last time with me, show you that this really works on both pages. They are working, so we know we have been successful. So in",13075.09,12.39
"general, this is gonna make your life much more easier if you're using the external CSS. No. One Last point that I would like to cover, though, is this path. In a lot of times, whenever you're working",13087.48,11.85
", your styles are going to be in fact in a separate folder because you're gonna have multiple files within your root directory as well as you're gonna have multiple ceases. And it's not a good idea. Just",13099.51,11.31
"have all these files over here. So what you would do in most cases and we're not gonna do this throat editorial. But throughout the project, we're gonna have the folder on, then within the folder, let's call this",13110.99,11.3
"folder. And again, it just makes sense. Leaving the folder is gonna be CSS and let's grab on copy and paste. It starts now, the moment we do that notice we don't have our styles anymore because the relative",13122.29,12.5

"first, So I'm going to say we're looking for two CSS and then we're looking for staff and again as a side note, this is also gonna work. So if I'm going to say for indexation Mel, I would have to look for CSS",13146.33,11.64
"folder and then order style CSS. Now everything is working for him and again this is gonna work the same way. If we're using the relative, No, let's also check it out in the about HTML. Again",13157.97,13.04
", we just need to point to CSS folder and then within the CSS folder we have the style CSS. And this is that we can start using the external stash it in our CSS projects",13171.02,11.62
". Awesome. We have covered in line internal and external CSS. However, before we dive into the syntax on how we can create a syntax, what are the rules for the syntax",13183.12,11.12

". Now, let me show you what I mean by this. No. First of all, I would like to clean up a little workspace a little bit. I mean, you don't have to do this, but I'm going to set it up basically the workspace, how we were going to use this. So let me close",13206.81,11.22
". First of all of the tabs for now, I would just like to have my neck station email. I'm going to use the style CSS on. I'm gonna move them out of the CSS folder as well as I'm gonna delete the CSS holder",13218.03,11.22
. So I'm not going to use it right now on. I'm going to get rid of the about HTML as well. So I'm gonna be left with only UNIX html on here. Let's create the proper path. So I'm gonna have,13229.64,12.42
"the style CSS. And now this is gonna be my set up. So as I'm looking at this right, I have my heading one as well, ascending to and for now, you know what I can just do with heading one is we're only going to show",13242.06,13.28
"you one example and then if I have my styles would, let's say color blue, what do you think happens if I'm going to create another one? The internal CSS again? Remember, this was done by",13255.34,11.51
"using style sheets. And let's say here, I'm going to write that You know what? Heading ones are gonna be different color. I think one is going to be, let's say, uh right. So let me write the proper syntax",13266.85,12.77
", which we will cover learn in the next video on, Let's say color is gonna be read. What do you think is gonna happen? No. This year I'm having heading one with color blue. But in my internal staff, she",13279.89,12.43
"I am writing This has color it. No, I haven't saved it yet, so nothing obviously is happening. But what do you think is gonna happen once I say, Do you think heading one is going to be bluer it? Now let's just it out. Let me",13292.84,12.82
say this on Interesting. What's happening is my headings not blue. But in fact they're red. So I can see that the internal style sheet is stronger than the,13305.66,13.09
"external one. Because we are overriding. Now let me tell you right away that we can. You use both of them. So let's say if you would have some kind of styles here for heading one, but you",13318.75,12.28
would have different styling here for having to. You can do that. It's not like against the law or anything like that. How are Just remember that if you're gonna have some kind of style here already for,13331.03,11.85

"some difference down here, it will going to get over it. That's something important. Now we also have the in line sees. Doesn't remember. So what about if we go to one of the heading ones on? Obviously, this is gonna",13379.06,12.49
"work the same on all of them, but I'm not gonna go show you the way we do it in all of them because it's just a waste of time. So let's just look at the first one on Heroes again. Change the color on",13391.55,11.89
". Let's use the green one. No, What do you think is gonna happen right now? So let's say this and Let's see. Interesting. So we have the external one that had a color blue. Then we use the internal one",13403.44,14.2
"on. We basically said you know what? No, it's going to be read. And then last but not least, we have the in line one which pretty much override both of them. And now we have the color green. So what you need",13417.82,12.73
"to remember is that the in line one is going to be the most strongest one. So whatever you're gonna right here within in line, he is gonna overwrite everything that you have with an internal or",13430.55,10.7
"external the same way with internal. You're gonna override the external one. And again, this is going to save you a lot of time when you're looking for some kind of bugs is to remember that in",13441.25,11.77
line one would be the most powerful one. Then we have the internal one and only then we have the external Excellent. We know who is the biggest bully on that would be the in line sources,13453.02,12.4
. So let's right now. Look at the syntax on the way. The general syntax work number four again. We do this. Let me just delete this comment in html. Let's get her the link. I,13465.79,11.42
think we can get all these headings. We can just leave maybe two of them. I'm just gonna get 103 of these months as delete the other heading to as well we can get Ah,13477.21,12.31
", this one deleted. So there's gonna be knowing line style on just as a side note. If you would like throughout seriousness tutorial, you can work within the stash it the internal",13489.53,12.73

"internal. So let's say it's a little bit more powerful to you to see that you're gonna be selecting having one, and you can see that the actual heading one is going to be right in front of you in your HTML. Now",13513.75,11.87
", I wouldn't suggest doing that when we were going to be working on the project because there's gonna be way more cold in the actual CSS. But for now, there's not gonna be that many, So you might as",13525.62,10.63
"well can do that? No, I'm going to write everything an external one because I just find it a little bit more interesting and useful for me when I have that external style sheet. But this is really up",13536.25,11.28

"common, so that's gonna do the same thing that's gonna be useful, especially as we're working through the project because you would want to separate your styles a little bit. So there's gonna be some styles that are for some type of section",13595.62,11.86
"of the page. Then there's gonna be other ones. So you will gonna use the comments. So just so you're not surprised of what's happening right now, if you would like to have the comment again, you'll just go here with me starting you line",13607.48,11.33

"for now, this is gonna work. But it gives you an error. So technically, if you're gonna do something like this, if we're gonna use another heading to notice, it's gonna be really hard. You are getting right away there. So here, we're gonna",13736.33,11.6

"proper syntax. So the moment I'm going to open up or I'm sorry, had the closing curly brace, then everything is gonna be working. Fine. Now, this is gonna be our whole declaration block now, like I probably mentioned",13759.7,12.24
"before. And no, this is not what I would like to do. The whole thing is gonna be called CSS rule. So this is going to be our whole that includes the selection er on the declaration block",13771.94,11.55

", let's work on the most basic selector. You know what I'm talking about? Now, this within is gonna be the property. So let's say within the declaration block, there's gonna be a declaration. Now, Declaration",13795.03,12.74
"is the property, plus the value. So in our case, this would be this line on what's right over here. Declaration. That's gonna be the naming. And then within the declaration, this guy's",13807.79,12.14
"going to be the property. So what kind of property would we want? Whether this is gonna be the color or font size And again, there's many, many properties, so obviously I'm not gonna cover them right now, but",13819.93,11.99
"in general, what you need to remember this is gonna be the property. Then we have this Intacs off a colon, and then here we have the values, and if we have many properties. We also have even more",13831.92,12.01
"value. So let's say four colors again. You name it. You want blue, you'll get blue. You one thread, you'll get read on. You get the idea now, Like I also mentioned before, the semicolon",13843.93,12.06
"is important. Because if I'm gonna admit to semicolon on again if we're gonna save it, notice something interesting. My color blue is not working as was my father said, And again, we're getting the errors right away. So it's",13855.99,12.08
"kind of hard to miss. And this is one of the neat things off using the actual nice text, that air, which is gonna give you right away suggestions. So you don't have to spend hours or minutes",13868.07,11.41

"me. Save it. Now we have a lot of comments. So now we know the basic syntax. And again, in a nutshell, all these things are gonna change. Depending on what you're doing, you're gonna have different selectors",13914.79,12.13
". You're gonna have different properties, and you're gonna have different value. So these things are going to be constantly changing. You're not always gonna work with heading once you're not always gonna work with just colors or, let's",13926.92,11.67
"say color Valley of Blue. So all things can change all the time. However, the syntax is going to stay the same. You will gonna have a selector. You're gonna have a property, and you will gonna have value",13938.59,11.58

"to create a new element, so there's gonna be one heading one with hello world, then heading to Well, let's have maybe a paragraph. Now, please understand that we can have all the regime elements we",13973.17,11.95

"if I'm gonna head over to Styles, insists on make my first election. Now, whenever we're gonna be working with selectors, the most basic selector is gonna be the type. Select now type",13997.6,11.91

"know. We We need to create a selector. In my case, let's say heading one. And now I would like to say what kind of styles I would want to add or this element. Now, in my case, I'm the right color",14035.29,12.72
"again. And we're gonna use color quite excessively in the beginning because that's just easier one to show you because you can right away. See it on the browser. Let's say again, we're gonna start very simply",14048.12,11.4
"by heading one is gonna be read. So sure enough, all the heading ones were in our kids. Just one that we have in our document are gonna have the color of red. Now the same is gonna work",14059.52,12.34

"on the most basic selector with the type selector where we just select the type off the HTML element we would like to style. If you want to be extremely precise, we should address",14110.14,12.38
"these selectors as element selectors. So if you're a stickler for names, here you go. Keep in mind, though, at least in my opinion it is much more important to know how to use them not to remember",14122.52,11.74
"every naming convention out there. That being said, once we have elements electors in our CSS still build. Yes, that's not for something really cool called element grouping, where we can combine",14134.27,12.56

. So how selector grouping work. So let's say right now we have three selectors. We have the heading one had in Q and Parker on what we would want to do if let's say we would want the whole text,14158.94,11.92
"to be blue. Well, you could say the simplest way would be very simple. We could just select the body since this is attack and add color. Well, let's try this out. Maybe like me. Delete this on",14170.86,13.76
". Let's say that instead of selecting heading one or paragraph, you could just do body on. We can use color blue so simple enough. Let's see what happens. Well, sure enough, it works. Okay",14184.62,14.26
". What about if I would just want the heading one? And hadn't you to be able our paragraph should say, I don't know, stay right or something like that. So let's say the whole body is gonna be red. But",14199.03,12.02
"then these do. I would want to people. Well, I can either select them specifically separately. I can't say anyone and heading to war. I can just group them together. In this case, I can",14211.05,12.61
"just say heading one comma so that would be this in tax on heading to is gonna be in a different color. In our case, let's say that it would be blue. I'm going again. Use the color blue on",14223.66,12.67
"the moon. We say with notice what happened? So both of the selectors that we have, if we group them together, both of them have the same property. We have the same value. So this is how we can use",14236.33,12.1
"grouping selectors in CSS. So far, so good. We know how we can work with group, but let's imagine a little bit different scenario. So let's say I'm gonna first delete this on. We're",14248.93,12.43
"gonna write, heading one is gonna be title heading Idol ending and then organize some kind of paragraph. We're gonna say paragraph and within the paragraph, I don't know, Let's place like 20 wards. There's something like that",14261.36,12.29
"And then after the paragraph, let's imagine there's gonna be another heading one, but this one is just gonna be at on your foot or heading again. It doesn't really matter how we call this. The main idea is gonna be very simple",14274.27,11.87
". So I would like to work with heading one, and I had some kind of styles on Lee to the heading one And let's say the other heading one. The photo heading he is gonna have a separate styles",14286.72,11.72
". Well, first of all, let me get rid of everything that I have for now. In my style, she and knowledge decide how we're gonna do this. So only the title heading is gonna have specific styles. And then the footer heading mood",14298.82,11.92
"have totally different styles. How we would do that well, in the CIA says we have an option off using the I d Select. Now, the way we work with the selector first, we would need to create a",14310.74,11.74
"90. In my case. I know that I would need to work with a attribute in mansion email, which would be I d. And naming here is important because we're gonna use it to actually select it in CSS",14322.48,12.35
". So let's call this. I don't know, a heading adul. And then also we can work with a heading one, but we're going to do that in a second. Once we understand how we can select this, we have the idea of heading",14335.32,11.26
"so far, so good. So we have the idea with a value of heading now, once we go to style CSS, If we would like like this Heidi, the syntax would be following. So first we were going to go with",14347.52,12.07
"hey hashtag and then we would need to come up with a name. Now when I say we would need to come up with the name, that means that the name should match whatever you have here in the value. Otherwise, you're gonna call this grandma",14359.59,11.74
". Madea, the CSS is not gonna be able to select it. So in our case, we know that we're selecting the heading on. Let's maybe use the color again. Property on. We're gonna say the color should be green power. Let's",14371.33,12.64
"also look at the other property, but we can use for colors that will be for the background. And again, we were gonna cover colors and literally few videos. However, just remember that",14383.98,11.17
"with a color, what you're doing is you're selecting the color off the text. Then the background is going to be self explanatory with a background. So it's a background. Should be. I don't",14395.16,11.78
know black. Now the moment we say would know what is what happens. Only the heading beheading one that had the title of the heading has over here this background like as well,14406.94,12.66
"as the color green. Now I can go back and I can change. It could maybe let's call this title heading. Maybe that should make a little bit more sense. So I can write title. However, the moment I changed the name or my value",14419.6,12.27
"in the A, the attributes Obviously the CSS is not anymore selecting because names don't match. So in our case again, we would need to head over on Let's say that this is gonna be the time now one thing with",14431.88,12.04
"ideas, what we should remember he is the simple fact that they should be unique What I mean by that. So let's say if we're gonna be working with the other heading the foot or hurting, we should have the i. D. Howard",14443.92,12.07
"that I d shouldn't match. The idea is that we already have currently on a page, So I'm gonna go this here subheading. So instead of using again, the title ideas should be unique because there's",14455.99,70.96
"and for the subheading again, we're using the Addy selector and we're saying that the background is gonna be gray on color is gonna be read. Excellent. We know how to use the I D selectors, but",14526.95,11.77
CSS offers also something really cool called class electors. So where were we would use these bad boys? I was always We're going to start by getting rid of what we had in the previous,14539.02,10.82
"video I'm Let's say in indexation email, we're gonna change this around a little bit. So I'm going to say that I'm gonna get rid of home headings and everything. And I would just like to work with, I don't know, heading three and",14549.84,11.71
again. It doesn't really matter what kind of elements were creating. The whole point is gonna be working with classes. So let's say there's going to be heading three on. I'm gonna call this I am on. We're gonna have green. So that,14561.55,11.94
"would be a green head now, within the second heading the other heading three. I'm going to say, Well, you know what I am red. So those are gonna be in my two headings so I can save this man. You know what? We",14573.49,12.48
"can just select them both and copy and paste a few times. So let's say that there's gonna be six headings total three of them are going to be green on. Three of them are going to be read now, as I'm looking",14585.97,12.92
"at it, I already concede that Yeah, everything is fine. So I have read, read, read. Everything is correct. No. How do I actually style them? Green or red. While you can say we could use the ideas right",14598.89,12.19
", because we cannot select them all. I cannot do like this because otherwise this is not gonna make sense. I'm gonna style them, but all of them are going to be exactly the same. So if I'm gonna write color green, all of them are going",14611.37,10.98
"to be green. And if I'm gonna write, call, read, all of them are gonna be coloring. So what would be solution? Well, you can say, OK, we can go back and we can start adding the ideas we can say, I don't know",14622.35,12.46
", maybe one. Right. So this would be number one that number 234 and then go back. Yeah, you could technically do this, but that probably wouldn't be the fastest way. There's actually a better",14634.82,11.75
way that would be using the class. No class is gonna be again attributes on our HTML on safe self explanatory. The name is gonna be class. So class selectors,14646.57,1.47
"other ways how we can work with CSS in order to work with multiple elements together, not just grouping the actual selectors. So that's something you should always remember it. If you like to use I ds",14648.04,10.9
would be using the class attributes and again for the class attributes. We will need to write the value now. This is not the best naming convention. I can tell you right away and having these green on. We're gonna cover this a,14658.94,1.01
"make sure that their unique for that specific element meaning you're not reusing them somewhere around the actual page. Otherwise, if the ideas are not unique, you're kind of losing the",14659.95,10.32
"lot in the project. But for now, alleges go with class of green, where for every heading that I would like to have green, I'm gonna have this classic cream. So instead of using daddies",14670.27,1.06
"actual meaning off. What is the reasoning for using dead Now? If we have the subheading much changed around a little bit, let's say again, we're gonna be selecting Hub subheading. Now we know that the naming right",14671.33,11.1
", we're gonna create a class on for every heading. Like I said that I would like to have green. I'm gonna copy and paste this on at the value of green. Now, for all the red ones, I'm going to change it. I'm not",14682.43,0.07
"now is correct. Maybe let's select these 1000. Let's just change these colors. So instead of green, that's gonna go with I don't know, text read on, then what we should use for the background? I don't know. Let's ",14682.5,11.82
"gonna say Green. We're gonna use the red. They're gonna let me select this value for this guy on, Let's say, for the red one, coughing paste on for the last one the same way. Now, how do we select them and see",14694.32,13.27
"us as though? So we'll head over back on. We're gonna get rid of this heading three. We're not interested in this. And now, instead of the hashtag that we used for the eighties, we need to use Doc. This is how",14707.59,12.19
"we can select classes. And again, we need to write the name of the class. I'm don't write grandma my idea because you don't have this glass in your document. Well, maybe you do have in yours, but I",14719.78,11.27
"don't have in mind. So in my case, we're gonna write Green. And now again, I can write whatever I would like in our case. Since this is gonna be best visual example, I'm gonna use green. And what happens? Onley The",14731.05,13.04

"classes that were added to the heading threes with the value of red were styled this way. So this is how we can use class directors in CSS, and they're very, very powerful",14769.92,12.28

"on. We're going to say the i d for the title. We'll just going to say that font size is gonna be really big. And again, we're gonna cover these properties in a second and just need to show you how things work with classes and I d. And",14829.66,11.38

"lower case now again, the main difference between the i d selectors and class electors. Because, as you can see, the only thing was syntax into CSS. But everything else",14864.25,12.25

"now. Gonna be with a color of red. Now, what is that happening? Well, because the assist is going to use the last rule that you're added and then apply that in the stash. No, usually what's gonna happen",15821.27,12.7
"is that you're gonna be card card working with your CSS, and you're gonna be adding lines and lines and lines and CSS And then later on, you're gonna come here somewhere on line 32 or 3000",15833.97,11.96

only the restaurant. So please remember whenever you're working that your last rule is gonna be applied regardless of what you have in between. So that's something to really too important to remember,15868.27,11.77
because there's gonna be cases where you're gonna find yourself looking for the reasoning off. Why certain CSS is displayed. So waste check whether you haven't applied another rule,15880.04,11.1
"that pretty much overrides your initial one. No, Also have ah, topic off specificity. Now what would dad me? Well, OK, let's look at the same example. We have one paragraph",15891.31,12.31

"be right? Well, I must just get out as you notice they are staying red. And the reason for that is, even though we're applying this with a last rule, the first rule is more specific",15940.86,12.25

"more specific parts of CSS. And since we have used colors for most of our examples anyway, why don't we start with colors and CSS? In the following Whittier's we will look at color",16067.34,11.4

color properties pretty much for all our examples. Why don't we start with colors on then we're gonna go from there and we'll start very simply by looking at two properties that you'll use most of the,16102.72,11.74

"within the heading three Wogan, right? I don't know I d on. Let's call this first on this is just gonna be I am heading adding number one, By the way, I noticed that all the time",16150.68,11.92
". I'm misspelling this, so if you're annoyed by this, my apologies, but unfortunately, that's what happens. I do like the misspell stuff. So let's right here second. So I'm gonna have to headings one",16162.6,12.37
"is gonna be number on. One would say on the other one is gonna be number two. So let's see how this is gonna look like, very simply. We have just heading. Now I'm gonna head over back to style, CSS",16174.97,13.09
". Like I said, we're gonna start working with the color properties now. We're not gonna look at the values right now, meaning we're gonna use the most basic ones. Those are we're going to cover in the next videos. But let's just start",16188.25,11.57
"by looking at the properties that you will use all the time with your colors. So, first, let's start by selecting a live now the div or I'm sorry, the i d. Some reason I keep naming",16200.09,12.19
"my ideas the dibs on my first I d is gonna have color, not the color property again. Could be anything we're going to go with. I don't know something like this. So this is gonna be my color",16212.28,11.62
". And then we're looking for the background color mom of the background colors. I was going to be responsible for the background. So the moment I'm going to save it notice right now, my i d With a name of",16224.28,11.32
first he is gonna look like this. So it's gonna have this background and obviously this would meet the car again. This would work with any element that you would like to apart from obviously something like image,16235.6,11.74
", where images totally separate. HTM moment. But let's say it would work with the link. It would work with the paragraph. Now, with the links there, some carry outs to it. But generally speaking, every time",16247.55,11.85
"you would want the color of the text to be some kind of color, you would use the cold property, and every time you would want the background, you use the background color property. Now, it's also tested out for the second",16259.4,11.03
i d. Because I would like to show you where the background actually has the shorthand. So we're gonna go over here and we're going to say that there is gonna be obviously the i d. Second. I believe,16270.59,11.54
"that's how I named it on here. Let's again use some kind of color. Now, this is just gonna be some crimson or something like this. And then let's work with the background. Now with the background eventually, we're gonna also",16282.13,11.95
"look at the background images and what happens is that what images we would use something like this and again, we're not going to cover this in great detail right now because we're gonna look at it later. But at the",16294.08,11.9
"end of the day, we can combine both of these properties here on just right, the shorthand. And this is something that you're going to see a lot in a ceases. And obviously we're gonna cover this a lot because we can do the same",16305.98,11.12
"thing we have. Let's say padding or margin, and you get that idea. So in our case, instead of writing the long way where we're just looking for the color, we can just write background. And then here we can write either",16317.1,11.05
"the color or later on. We're obviously going to start working with images as our background. So in our case, let's just say that this is gonna be yellow on weaken. Save it. Noticed that it's gonna work exactly the same way",16328.15,11.22
". So just please be aware that you can use background color just as you work more the color. But later on, as we're going to start work with, images were also can use the background short at where we just",16339.85,11.31
"read background on. Then whatever value were tapping here for the color. Awesome. We're experts on color properties. What about the values? Well, our most basic option would be using color names",16351.16,12.5
"on this is as straightforward as it gets. Every time we're gonna be using the property, that's a color or background color. More the shorthand for the background. We would want to use some kind of",16364.05,11.34
"color name. Now, what's neat about visual studio code that it gives the suggestions. So if I would want color names starting with why it's gonna give me the color. And I'm starting with why, If",16375.39,11.65
"I'm gonna start with A, it's gonna give me color names with a and you get the point. There's 100 and 40 off the color names. If you would like to know all of them. You can again head over to W three schools",16387.04,11.56
"on. Just start scrolling down and you'll see all the color names now, Like I said, this is just gonna be as basic as it gets. Every time you would want to have color or background color property, you can always",16398.9,11.49
"pick a value from the color names. Using color names for your project is very neat and handy. However, eventually you're gonna run out of your options. Basically",16410.39,11.41
", the more project we're gonna build the bigger project you would like to build. You're gonna be reaching for some more color options. On one of the color options we have is RGB Now, what in the world is",16421.8,11.99
"RGB Most? The RGB stands for red, green and blue. And then we can pick color values from 0 to 255 meaning zero would be the smallest",16433.79,11.84
"onto 55 would be largest. So how we would use this. Well, first of all, let's delete this color name and let's right there. We're gonna be looking for RGB color. Now we're gonna write rgb um let's right over",16445.91,12.009
"here. What values? Who was like, Well, since I would like my color to be completely red, you can have my value to 2 55 and then for rest of them for green and blue. I'm just gonna set them zero. Now, I",16457.919,12.22
"already concede that visual Studio Gold is giving this suggestion. So basically, this is gonna be the color that we're gonna have on. We can clearly see that this is gonna be right. Now let me save it. And",16470.14,11.639
"sure enough, I have my red color. Now, as we working with RGB values, we also have an option off having the black or white color. So how we would get the black color gun looks right. Rgb",16481.779,12.31
That would be our syntax. And then we're looking for 000 So all three zeros would mean that we're getting the black color now. The white one would be completely opposite that one. We,16495.24,12.109
"will be 2 55 to 55 on 2 55 So it's just, you know, personal change for the i d. Number second two green color. So let's say the color of the text",16507.349,12.53
"is gonna be green. So how do we do this again? zero, 2 55 and 2 55 since the green is the second value, correct. And then we're looking for the background of white. Now. Obviously, the moment",16519.89,12.79
"I'm gonna do that, you'll see that it's gonna be hard to notice because their whole text is white, our whole document. But let's try it out. So it's right to 55 2 55 on, let's",16532.68,13.0
"say, 2 55 Like I said and start to notice because our whole background this way No. Why don't we go to the body on Let's look at different values because for now, you're probably thinking, Well, wait",16545.68,12.62
a minute. He's just using the red and green color known. Let's mix it up a little bit. Let's say for the Bari there's gonna be background on let's write RGB values and then you can right here,16558.3,12.17
"whatever your heart desires. So I'm gonna write 100. I would say 34 on may be here. This is gonna be 210 and let's see what kind of color. And obviously, first of all, I can",16570.47,12.93

look for RGB and then we're saying 00 on The last one is going to be 255 because obviously that is from the blue one on land for the background again. Maybe let's,16633.04,11.899
"test it out a little bit different values. So let's say rgb and then we're looking for I don't know, 100 on dread on 100 let's see how this is gonna work up. This is like a dark",16644.939,11.89
gray color. Hopefully you understand that this is how we work with RGB values on feel free to experience with these values and then next video gonna look at the rgb,16656.84,11.72
a value. It's easy to see that RGB values give you much more power because you have way more options than just choosing the car names. Our what's also really need about RGB,16668.56,15.61

. Let's write some color values. I'm gonna start first. By color on I would like to practice a little bit off rgb a on. We're going to say that I don't know this is gonna be like 100. And then again,16730.369,12.35
", let's say 100 and 23. Um I don't know, 56 whatever value you would like now the difference here is for the background. I would like to go with a black macron. How are",16742.88,11.89
"I would like to use the opacity and transparency values you hear? I'm gonna write background. Then again, I'm gonna be looking for RGB. But instead of just simple rgb, we're gonna be looking for RGB",16754.77,12.59
"now. How we would write this again, we would look for the black color honestly, since this is our option and then we're gonna be looking for what kind of capacity or transparency this is gonna be So let's say",16768.02,11.68
"here if I'm gonna write 0.5, this is not gonna be totally black color. Noticed that this would be a great score because we would be adding the opacity of 0.5. Now, we were gonna be practicing",16779.7,12.19
"all Onley with RGB A for the background of black, but obviously understand that you can use any color here. What's important here is this opacity called Now again, it's probably gonna be easier",16791.89,12.04
"if we're gonna look at multiple values. So it's competent paste this. Let's say for a second one we're gonna be using a different one. So first of all, let me select again the first on Let's change",16803.93,12.26
"this to a second. So for the second, maybe I would like to maybe have a different color. The color is gonna be, I don't know, 45 on and I don't know, 200 on. Let's",16816.19,13.62
"say the third one is gonna be animal 34 and again just to show you that you can obviously have different college rallies now, mostly focusing on the green one. So maybe let's this one, like 10 because otherwise",16829.81,12.14
are all of them are going to be green. So this is gonna be totally black old here. So why don't we practice on having the capacity of zero point? Let's say 25 and I'm giving right now kind of,16841.95,11.34
"round values, but understand that you have an option off 0 to 1. So one is gonna be the Maxwell. I'm zero would be the smallest one. So as I'm working here, notice",16853.29,12.83
"0.5 would have a less transparency. That 0.25. So if I'm gonna go totally with zero, this is gonna give me totally white color. Don't believe me",16866.51,11.95
". Now, let's this thing out. Then we're gonna copy and paste that here In this case, we're gonna change it around. I'm gonna say the value is gonna be three. So harshly. 40 idea of two. Now, let's go. Totally red",16878.8,12.34
color. So here we have 2 55 00 That's gonna be my option on Let's notice if I'm gonna go with totally black color. How are also more capacity is gonna be zero,16891.14,13.15
". What's gonna happen? Well, the background is there, but we cannot see it. And this is our capacity. Value would work. So even though we have a black color. We made it totally transparent by adding",16904.57,12.34
"here 40 capacity value zero. However, if would like to check totally black color, we know we have the 84. Then let's have a different color. Maybe a blue one. Let's say rgb",16916.91,12.15
again. Rgb then we're looking for 00 on. Then the Third Valley is gonna be to 55 and here for the background. Let's have totally black color with RGB a Juve,16929.06,12.71
"on that will be 00 on one. Now, obviously, in this case, you might as well just right RGB because there is no difference. And again, we're using the round values just to show you that how",16942.08,12.12
this would work because I'm not gonna cover every number from 0 to 1 0.1 or 0.2 because this is gonna waste a lot of my time. But we noticed that there are fourth I d,16954.2,11.79
"is having a totally black color with a color obviously of blue because we already know how the RGB would work. Now if you would want to experimental more, let's a body. Let's go",16966.34,11.51
"for some kind of background color and in our case again with use RGB a And then again we can write whatever our hearts desire. So if I'm going to start by 10 uh, 10 and maybe here",16977.85,12.47
". I don't know, 200 I would like to have some kind of capacity. Let's say 2000.0 point three, let's notice what we're gonna happen. So now this color would look like this. However, if I'm gonna omit that",16990.7,12.6
"and if I'm going to say rgb a noticed, I'm gonna be having totally blue color. So what The opacity ads is right now pretty much or transparency. So again, let's go back. And let's say that RGB",17003.34,11.55
"a is gonna be I don't know, 0.1 something like this mor 0.2. It doesn't really matter the moment. I'm going to say it's gonna be almost wait because we're almost",17014.89,12.57
"transparency level, Okay, so if we're gonna go up, obviously we're gonna go like zero point. I don't know 56 what we're gonna Well, now we're gonna have less transparent color so",17027.47,12.69
"more towards the blue one again, this would work with any color valley. So if I'm gonna right here not 3 55 But let's say 200 months notice. Now we're going more towards the green and again",17040.16,12.01
"green with some kind of Transparency Valley, not just regular going. And this is really powerful whenever we're working with a CSS, because this is going to allow us to create, like an overly",17052.17,11.85
"So let's say there's gonna be some kind of picture and we would want to add some kind of color on top of the picture. So the picture, let's say, is not as break. So that is where we can use RGB air values by controlling",17064.49,11.22
"or opacity. One would think that having color names as well as RGB and RGB a values would give us more than enough options. But lucky for us, we have more",17075.71,11.39
"ways to work with colors in CSS on those would be H s l as well a sex of decimal values. Now we will not cover hs o, since at this point I find",17087.1,12.05
"it a massive overkill. If you would like to research on your own, of course, there are plenty of great resource is just type CSS hs l and you're gonna be blown away. We will, however",17099.15,11.71
", cover accidents Immel color values or just hex values for sure. X values work a lot like RGB, where it covers the spectrum off red green",17110.86,12.6
"on you guessed it blue colors. The difference, though, would be the fact that hex give you much more color choices. Because instead of just using numbers, hex values can also be letters from",17123.84,12.14
"A to F, where a would represent a number of 10 and F would represent the number of 15. Well, the syntax would be following first. We would need to have the hash tag. Then the first two values would represent",17135.99,12.89
"color of red on it could be any number from 1 to 10 on the letter from a toe, for example, if we would want to have a red color, we would write like this notice we have the hash tag. So we're",17148.88,13.27
"looking for tax value, and then we have to efs. Since we know that the half is gonna be the highest one now, does that mean is the same thing as we were working before with RGB, where the highest 1 to 55",17162.15,13.21
"waas obviously read anarchic since with hex value, it's exactly the same. Our what you notice here is that you have way more numbers in between. If you were just looking here from",17175.7,11.75
"0 to 55 here you're looking at two values that each of them can be from 0 to 50. So again in general, in one short sentence, the hex values are",17187.45,12.0
"just going to give you way more color options. That's all the wrister. And as always, I think it's the best way to actually practice with this. Now I will gonna get rid of the body. I don't think that color is",17199.45,11.71
"helping us right now as well as I don't think I need to create anything in the HTML. I think that's a little bit overkill or it each and every time heading over to HTML on Let's start, maybe with",17211.17,11.95
"an idea first and let's decide what we would like to see. So I guess again, as always, let's start with the red one. But please remember, these are not the only colors you can have. Well, just using them for examples",17223.12,11.77
". So let's say that we were going to get rid off the RGB. We don't need this on. You know what? Let me right away delete both of lines since we're gonna rewrite both. And let's say that here, I'm gonna",17235.28,11.97
be looking for the hex color. And that way we know that this is gonna be hashtag then ff because I would like to have the red 100. Let's say 00 for bull hand 00,17247.25,11.52
for it. I'm sorry. The 00 for green and 00 for blue. Unless you can see right away. The visual studio code gives us the color box where it tells us that this is gonna be red,17258.77,11.77
"color. So I wasn't the pulling a fast one on you. Okay, What about the background? Well, let's check it out. How we can get a black Well, if we would have to guess if you already were working with RGB, what",17270.54,12.26
"would you think? How we would get the black well with RGB, we got 000 Well, what about if we tried with hex? So I can say here 000 And what you can see is that there's gonna be",17282.8,12.48
an options for you in hacks colors where you don't have to type all six zeros. If you just died three on this pretty much is gonna mean exactly the same thing. Not with me. Save it and let's see what's gonna happen. And surprise,17295.28,12.15
". Surprise. I'm having a black color as my background on my hex color would be for surrender. Okay, let's test it out. The green one. How are let's switch it up a little bit? Let's say that this",17307.43,12.35
"guy's gonna be green, and we know that this would be hex value on we're looking for 00 f f That would be for the green one, and they were looking for 00 So this should turn green",17319.78,11.75
". And instead of the color being green, we're gonna have the background green. But the color is gonna be white. So I'm gonna show you how we can get the white color with a hex values. So let's say hashtag",17331.88,11.67
"then. We're looking for F f now. Why again? We're using F f f. Remember RGB What was the value? Well, it was 2 55 That was the max zero was the black one. So Max was the white one",17343.56,12.48
"on that zero was the black well, it works the same way with hex values. Just the difference with hex value. Maxes Over here, Max is the 15 again. Let's save it and what do we see? Three",17356.05,12.99
. The color The background color is green on the actual color. He's white. Awesome. Now let's try with Div more. I'm sorry. Heading number three Meaning the I. D number three. And in this,17369.05,12.03
"case, let's try it out. Maybe the blue one. It's a hashtag on. This would be against 0000 and then we're looking for FF, which should give us the blackwall",17381.08,11.13
". You I'm sorry, the blue out And as you can see right now, I'm having this in Texas. No, I am having the syntax error because I'm trying to write the hex color with seven values instead of six. So let me delete",17392.21,12.02
"one of zeros and we have ourselves a blue color. Now maybe let's test it out some different value because again, probably you are a little bit confused of why we always use these colors the red, green",17404.23,11.55
"and blue. Why, we can try some other colors on. Sure enough, we can. And let me show you my favorite at least orange color, which would be F 15 0 to 5 From the moment we're gonna",17415.78,12.06
"save it, this is gonna be our orange color on then. Obviously, my color for the text is still gonna be green. I'm sorry. The blue not green. And then last but not least, let's work with the four. Where was gonna give",17427.84,11.88
"some random colors for Hex? So it's a hex value, and then we're looking for I don't know, 234 a. D something like this. So this should be a pink one. And then",17439.72,12.32
"what's happening here is gonna be another value of hex on. Let's just go with 222 which is gonna be the black one. But in general, this is how it would work with hex colors in the CSS. It would also",17452.04,12.01
"be a crime from my part, not to mention the awesome tools that visual studio code offers us whenever we were working with colors. So let's say if I'm looking at this hex color What if I would like to change",17464.05,10.99
"the car, which you noticed as I'm hovering over the color? I have these options. So, first and foremost, I could change whatever values I'm getting back so as you can see right now I'm working with hex values. What if What if I change",17475.04,11.91
"my mind? That's a You know what I would like to have The h s l Well, I can just click on it. And now my values in HSM Now, if I want RGB, I'm getting the RGB I also noticed something else",17486.95,12.52
". If you have here this board, these cardboard has that left click it on this death. I can just change whatever color value I have on it gives me the values here in RGB. So let's say here",17500.06,12.76

if we're trying out Green? What about red? And again? I can go on and on the whole day to show you that you kinds of you have all kinds of options or now we can also control the opacity,17524.54,11.26
". So even though this is gonna be the color, then here we're looking basically for the tone. We also can change the opacity. And if I'm gonna go completely over here to the zero, I'm gonna have RGB",17536.25,11.73
"a value of zero. Now, remember, what was the zero? What? It was totally transparent. So if I'm going to save this right now, check it out. You're not gonna be able to see any of the text, because right now, the capacities level",17547.98,11.64
"is all the way down to zero. If you want capacity 0.5 well, let's go somewhere there is 0.5 and then this is going to respect me back some value off. Whatever I'm having again. If I would like to change",17559.62,11.47
"it to let's ahead color right away, I can just change it to hex color. So we have all kinds of options here with visual studio code and all of these things combined. Make it the best text better out",17571.09,10.93
"there if you're anything like me. It is a great struggle for you to pick nice colors for your next project on. And while there are many great options out there, since all of them essentially do the same",17582.02,11.63
"thing that is, offer you a color palette. I'll show you coolers, which I use the most as always, this is subjective. So if you like some other resource, no hard feelings on the way",17593.65,12.08
"it works is we're gonna have to visit coolers dot com on. If you're looking at the girl, this is just gonna be basically see and then two O's and then again, L o",17605.73,11.41
"R s and they were looking for dot to you. Now, the moment we visit the site, we noticed that we're getting this interface on the home screen. We see this button, start the generator of its free",17617.15,11.51

see this greenish yellowish or whatever. Now we can pick all these colors more. Let's say you would just more so you'll have to press the space bar on now it spits back another set of,17640.35,11.38
"colors, and I can go endlessly here with the space bar. And you understand the idea that this is just gonna give us each and every time, and you call her power. Now let's say if I like this green bluish",17651.73,11.73

"more colors again. With the space bar on, I can go on and on and on now in the bottom. Right now we already know what are the hex colors. So we can just copy and paste this value on but we can head over back",17674.92,11.44
"to our text Better on, Let's say for the color I'm gonna pick this guy. I noticed that it doesn't come with the hex value actual hashtag I'm gonna leave the hashtag once I believe the old color Let me copy and pasted",17686.36,12.5
"once we're gonna save it right now, my color is gonna be this greenish If we would like to let's say change your background to this guy the party born again. We copy the value we're gonna head over back to",17699.24,11.47
"text editor on Let's say here for the background again with a hashtag mood is gonna have the background car now. Normally, what you're gonna do is you're going to get all these colors up here on top of the",17710.72,11.31
CSS. And then we're gonna later on learn how to use this thesis variables and how we're using them. Most likely you're not gonna be jumping back and forth for each and every element and getting the colors,17722.03,10.93
". But the main idea is, if you would like to pick some kind of nice colors that actually go together, you would be looking for some kind of external research on the one that I like to use is the coolers dot",17733.35,10.91
"seal beautiful. We know know how to implement colors and CSS What's next on our agenda? How about CSS units? Over the course of next five years, we'll discuss",17744.26,12.35
what our units more is the difference between absolute and relative units as well. Let's take a closer look at pixels E m or E M values as well as Vieux port units,17756.62,11.12
"off with hand height in the process. We're also gonna learn New Seasons properties that implement units in their values. Okay, you know, theory. Let's get after it. All right. We",17767.75,12.34
"have added colors to our series is still built. What's next? Our next topic is very interesting because it will control the layout off our project. So, my friends, let's get to know units",17780.09,12.4
"in CSS and we'll start with something called pixels. Here's the kicker dough. In order to cover units, we're gonna have to use them on some properties. Otherwise, we might as well look at this lights",17792.5,12.38
"for the next three hours. So let's quickly learn three properties in the CSS. Fun size with and height. If you would have to guess What do you think these properties control? Well, if I would have",17804.88,12.74
"to go out on a limb, I would say found size is responsible for the size of our funds. More text on with and height would control the with on height off the elements",17817.62,10.93
". So far, so good. What about pixels? Well, again, we can spend two hours and 20 slides or we can resolve it in one sentence. Answer where pixel is an absolute unit",17829.13,12.12
"of measurement. On speaking very broadly, one pixel represents one dot on the screen. So as you're looking at this screen right now, one pixel is basically gonna be wonder and",17841.25,12.0
"again. This is speaking very broadly because I don't want to spend two hours in slide. No, let's test it out. Because this is just gonna be the easiest way to understand now, as you can see, by the way",17853.25,11.95
", I cleaned everything out in CSS and HTML because for this new section, I would like to start fresh. Now again, I'm gonna do very simply where there's going to be heading one on. I'm just gonna say, units",17865.2,12.06
"in the CSS in the CSS. So that's gonna be my text on the moment I finished typing. Awesome. We have are heading one. Now I'm gonna head over, back to this town's on. We're gonna",17877.66,11.69
"test our first property, which would be phone size, so we know that we can select it in multiple ways. And in my case, I'm just gonna pick the elements, Elector, that I'm gonna write. What kind of fun size I would like something",17889.35,11.33
"to say. Font size. This is gonna be my property. And now I'm using the values on. As you can see, there's many options that right now, visual studio code gives us, but what we are interested is the pixels",17900.68,11.35
"So here we're gonna say that. Let's say this is going to be 30 pixels, not check this out the moment we're gonna save it. This is, in fact, going to get smaller. Okay, what if we're gonna write 60 pixels now? My phone size",17912.52,12.28
"is gonna get way bigger because I added this absolute value. Now, why did I say that pixels are absolute values of measurement? Well, you say 60 pixels right now, what we have here",17924.8,11.4
", he is gonna be 60 pixels here as well as it wouldn't be 60 pixels on the difference creases. So the 60 pixels or pixels in general are not gonna depend on anything",17936.46,11.39
"else. Yours is gonna come up with your absolute size, whatever that might be. And then you was gonna go with. Now, later on, As we're looking for responsive values, you'll see how, with responsive values",17947.85,12.19
"we will gonna be, depending on other things. But with pixels. This is just gonna be straight up. Give me the value for the pixels on these are gonna be dots on the screen. And let's say for the font size, it's",17960.25,11.96
"one thing. No. What about the with? Let's say what if we're gonna say some kind of with on for the setting one again with me. Write it properly. Let's say with is gonna be I don't know, 200 pixels",17972.21,12.22

"how we can use the color when we already covered this. Right, So we have the background on, Let's say, let's go with some kind of color again. I'm gonna go with the color name because I find it much more easier. So I'm gonna",17997.16,11.08
"gonna be 200 pixels on the bigger screen. So again, it's not gonna depend on any parent elements and the route elements anything like that. This is just gonna be straight up valued that we're giving you want more with",18020.71,11.18
"no here ago I have 404 100 pixels. This is not what I wanted. Didn't let me say it properly. Now, this is gonna be 400 pixels again, depending on the screen size. If I'm going to say that this is gonna be let's",18032.12,11.7
"say 1000 now, obviously this is gonna be wrapping out, so now wouldn't actually need to scroll because this is literally gonna be 1000 pixels. So on a smaller screen hours that this is not gonna be able to fit in the screen. However",18043.82,12.09
", if we moved to the bigger screen size, everything is working. Fine. This is gonna be our 1000 pixels. Now, let's test it out also, Maybe the height. And you know what? Let's change this 12 decent 400",18055.92,11.63
"that is going to stay in the same. So let's save it or, you know, more. Hundreds still to make let's do 200. That's gonna be our value on Let's maybe add some kind of height on for the height, we're gonna be looking",18068.04,12.82
"for the height property again on In this case, we're gonna go with 300 pixels and again, all of these are very straightforward. You want bigger size. Just go with bigger size. Now you don't have to always use",18080.86,12.58
pixels. We will going to cover all the relative values. How are the main importance is to understand that the font size is going to control the height of the text. So the bigger obviously the value here,18093.44,11.6
", the bigger is gonna be the text. Smaller value. You get that idea now, the same would work with with Again, we're gonna be working later on with responsive values. But you just need to pass some kind of unit",18105.25,12.01

"very easy. We're gonna say 50%. So far, so good After that, we would like to look at the height, so I'm gonna say height on again. We can do the same thing high. It is gonna be 15% now, also in order to see what's happening",18190.94,12.63

"on. Also, the height is as well going to be 500 pixel. So far, so good on. Let's add maybe also a background color on the background. Is there gonna be a bull? What's Avis and what do we see",18267.79,12.84
"? So we have the outer def. That should have the 505 100. And then the inner one is going to be exactly the half, because obviously, we went with 50% as well as the 50%",18281.39,12.55
"for the height. So now you can see that this is a relative. This is relative to the parent. So if I'm gonna make this 200 just so we can understand a little bit easier, we should We should see that the",18293.94,12.41
"U nerd if should be 100 by 100 now, it is still gonna be displayed in the percentages. How are the moment we're gonna be changing these values? The 200 or 200 Also, the with off the",18306.35,2.92

"of the heading one as well as we're gonna head over back to HTML on here, I'm going to create a new live. I'm gonna have some class going to say that this would be the alternative on within the outer Devlet",18333.72,9.72

". So basically devils in the details where it depends on the parent again. And as always, I think it's just easier to go through with an example. Now, we're gonna head over first to the next HTML",18355.82,12.33

"the text. I mean, doesn't really matter what I have there because I haven't covered yet. What is the, um but now let's look at the absolute. I'm going to say absolute. I'm salute on. This is gonna be fun size",18445.53,13.59
". And I was like, this would be a second heading three on. We're gonna say phone size it is gonna be 32 picks off. Okay, Now, I know it might be hard to see because it's a different text. So maybe if you want",18459.12,12.39
", you can go back and just write in different text the one that would match Absolute. But I can tell you right away they are exactly the same. Now, how do I know that? Well, you see, first of all, is I'm looking here. What do you think is",18471.51,12.75
"a parent element for my relative class here? Well, if I'm looking at it, I think this is a body on for the body by default in most cases, the base text for default brother styles which",18484.26,12.74
"will, by the way, cover the default brother styles right after this section on the default brother style is 16 pixels, basically the font size for default browsers",18497.0,12.06
". I'm sorry. In the browsers default font size is 16 pixels. No 1 a.m. one e m. Value is equal to, in this case, 16 pixels. However, if we're",18509.47,13.36
"gonna change this value, then also the e m is going to change. So for now, both of them are exactly the same because this is 32 pixels absolute value on this two year. He's also 32",18522.83,12.46
pixels because my default browser style is 16 pixel. But what about if we're gonna go to the settings and again you don't have to do this. You can just watch how I'm doing it. But as I click,18535.29,12.33
"on this icon over here, I have an option for the setting. Now I'm going to click on the settings and then as you scroll down notice, you have an option for font size. Now again, if you're using different browser, it would be locating different place",18547.62,11.28
". But if you are using Google Chrome, you should be able to find here font size. No, In this case, I have right away medium, which is default style. But what if I would change this? Whatever I would say Oh, here",18559.27,11.85
"very large, not can close the settings, notice something interesting. So now my relative is actually way bigger than the absolute because I change this default browser",18571.12,12.69
"style font size. Now, this is not anymore 16. This is in fact, bigger. And I can see this because this relative is actually bigger than absolute. Now with me, first of all, change it back. And",18583.81,12.82
"once I change it back, let's create another example. Just so you know, for shorted, this is exactly what I'm saying. Now I'm gonna head over again, back to indexation email, and in this case, we're gonna create our own",18596.63,11.27
"parent containers forties, heading three. So for the first one, we're gonna create some random live and let make and selected. Probably gonna place it here. We didn't deal on for the second one. Will also gonna do the same thing",18607.9,11.62
". So almost everything the same. However now, both of are heading threes are as a Children for two of the dips. So have parented as well as the second parenting. What about",18620.16,12.05
"now? Well, I'm gonna go back to a sickness. I'm going to say for all the lives, the font size, the base font size shouldn't be, Let's say I don't know, 20 pixels. So phone size",18632.21,13.2
"that property on, I'm gonna say 20 pixels. No. What do you think is gonna happen? Notice again? This is bigger on. If I would actually want to maybe proved the point a little bit better. I'm gonna say 10 pixels. So right",18645.41,13.32
"now the e. M. Is following the fact that the parent as the base size off 10 pixels. So it's one EMR is right now equal to what? Well, this is equal to a 10",18658.73,12.26
"pixels. So now this font sizes in fact 20 pixels because all we're doing is basically multiplying this. So if my base on sizes 10 pixels no, I multiplied by two and I'm getting 20",18670.99,12.41
"pixels right here, then the absolute one doesn't care about that. The absolute still stays 32. So that's the key. Whenever you're working with the e m values, remember that you will gonna be depending",18683.4,12.63
"on the parents container. And if you're changing something in apparent container that's gonna reflect of what's happening with he e m values after he and values, we're gonna look at our ian values",18696.03,11.8
"on even though they look exactly the same. They, in fact, performed quite differently. Number four. We actually go over any theory. Let's just do a small test now. For now, we have the relative",18708.18,12.65
"which would be in him, which would depend on apparent whore. Let's change this around. Let's say that this value again is gonna be to rum's. So in the morning when we change it notice against something interesting. So",18721.13,13.09
now both of them are again exactly the same. So the first key about RM values is that they will not depend on apparent. So I can change this all day long. I can say that there should have,18734.22,10.91
"40 and nothing is gonna change. What does matter is as I'm working with my route off the document now, our case, What is the root of the document? Whenever we're looking at our document, I believe",18745.14,12.26
"this is gonna be there in your mouth. So instead, if I'm gonna go and say that 40 html is we would like to change it and let's say instead of 16 pixels, which again comes by default from the browsers",18757.4,11.68
"the same way how we looked at the M values we can say, let's say that the font size is gonna be I don't know, not 16 but we're gonna go with I don't know, 32. So it's right",18769.08,11.79
"fun size 32 pixels on. Let's see what we're gonna have. And now, obviously, this is gonna be 64 pixels Now, how do we know that? Well, if I'm gonna head over here on. We're gonna change it again",18780.88,11.88
from 30 to 64. We'll see that now. They're exactly the same. So what's happening is it's the same system. So whatever we have here has a fun sized original,18792.93,11.83
"for the actual route off the document. This is gonna be either doubled if we're going to Ari EMS, where we for going with 1.5? We'll just need to do the math. When we calculate how much",18804.76,11.45
"is 1.5 from the 32. And I believe this is gonna be, like, 48 again, we contest this out and we can say that this is gonna be 48 now both of them should match. So what's happening is that with",18816.21,11.93
"r E M values again, we're not depending on a parent. We are depending on the route, which, in a document, is gonna be a steam l. Now what's also gonna happen is not say that I'm",18828.2,11.41

"the with What about the height? Let's also say you heights And then let's check it out again. Background is gonna be ready. No, no, that's something interesting. Dont pay attention, please. Again, there's gonna be margins",18970.44,12.61
"that we're getting from default browser styles. But what's happening is we're getting 50% of the screen horizontally as well as vertically. Now, if I'm gonna make my screens as bigger, it's not gonna change",18983.05,11.81
"again. Depending on the screen size, this is still going to be 50% horizontally and 50% vertically. Don't believe me. That's tested out with another guy. Let's say that there's gonna be header on",18995.09,12.54

"be making some kind of banners like this. We will gonna use these values more these units. Now, let me add one more thing on. Let's a background is gonna be blue. Now",19031.67,11.93

"about the styles display block that doesn't ring a bell? We didn't write that font size. Well, we know the property, but I don't think we included. Okay. Well, maybe I'm wrong. Let's head over back to style",19354.87,12.61

"want here, Bond on. We're gonna write style. So for home, my body, I would want to Let's say, have italic. Well, the moment I'm going to save it noticed something interesting. So everything here turns italic",21159.85,12.41

"anyway, so let me comment this out. I'm going to save it now. This is gonna be normal. And then, sure enough, we have texting them to 50 pixels. If you don't believe me, make 100 pixels. And now this",21387.63,12.25
"is inventing again on first line? No, Like I said, we can years also hardy and values, so I don't know, 10 Ari ems. That should do the trick. Now then Sten Williams. And that's how we",21399.88,11.34
can work with text the line properties on text indent. You know what I changed my mind just because I would like to be done covering the text properties. We're gonna cover five properties,21411.22,14.45

". This paragraph is gonna be lure. Um, on the whole 25 actually want multiple lines. So that's kind of my important thing. I think three lines is more enough. I'm just gonna say, here class class",21483.51,12.33
"is gonna be number one, and I would like to copy and paste this some of the select all of this and want you. So there's gonna be paragraph with the class of number two. You know what? I can just use the multiple sectors",21495.84,11.85

"that is obviously the name that we're looking for on for the line hide, This is gonna be relative again. At the moment, we haven't set it up anything that the parent, which would be the body. But in general, this is gonna be relative",21545.43,11.86
"to something. So at the moment, this is gonna be relative of the browser. So I'm gonna say 1.5 e EMS notice. Right now, my line heights are getting bigger. Don't believe me. Let's try 2.5 and you will",21557.29,12.12
"see that now I have way bigger Leinart. But again, if we're gonna change this somewhere in the body or the parent element, let's say there's gonna be Div. Then this is going to depend again off how we're controlling",21569.41,11.13
"for the parents at the moment. This is working with the browser. Well, let's say if I'm going to say 0.5, then my lines are gonna be very small. And that's how the line height woodwork. Next up, we have the letter spacing",21580.54,12.11
". So let's write for the paragraph. Number two, we're gonna be looking forward. A let their spacing. I won't be the name",21592.94,7.05

"explanatory. The one we're going to save it. I'm going to be getting the five pixels in between each each and every letter on the actual element that I have selected. So far, so good. We also have",21611.51,11.79

well as line height is also very self explanatory. Then we have text transform. So why don't we practice on our heading here? I'm going to say we're still heading one on. Then we're gonna be looking for text,21646.56,11.88
transform on in the text for in form. We're gonna have capitalized. We're gonna have lower case and we're gonna be looking for uppercase. So these are the ones that we were gonna use most of the time. So,21658.45,12.33
"let's say start with an upper case, the whole text is gonna be uppercase. And sure enough, right now, heading is upper case. I could also do what's a capitalized than the letter of each",21670.78,11.52
"word is the first letter is gonna be capitalized just like this. And then if you want to test that out the lower case, honestly, again, we're gonna have to go to the body on Let's say if we're all of them were old",21682.3,11.67
"elements I have text in Swarm is gonna be the upper case. And here before heading, I'm gonna change my mind. And I'm going to say I would like to go with the default one, which is lower case. But if you're not gonna have",21693.97,11.93
"anything to the parent element, which in our case would be the body, then obviously nothing is gonna happen if you're gonna add lower case, because this comes by default as well as we have text decoration",21705.9,12.25

". He is the fact that it has this underlying by default. So what you're gonna do a lot Whenever you're gonna be working with CSS, you're gonna be looking for text decoration on. In this",21755.95,12.11
"case, we're not gonna be looking for colors going to say that we would want X decoration on. So you're gonna get rid of this underline unless you really dig down the line on Let's look at different properties",21768.06,11.78
"that we have for down the line on Let's say not for the whole body, but we're heading one that's again. Go for text decoration on for text decoration. Let's deal line through. So now I'm gonna",21779.84,11.71
"have line heading through are heading one Also, we have the on overline option. Why don't we test it out on this guy on paragraph number two when we have the line? Uh, I'm",21791.55,12.48

"on. Sure enough. What happens is you see that we have overlying no, again. It's kind of doesn't make sense. We have multiple Ryan's, right. So you might be thinking, Well, it's kind of like an underline. Yeah, it is",21816.64,11.42
". Underline. Because if you're looking from this perspective on just to kind of give you an idea, we know we can use line height. So why don't we get really creative and I have this line",21828.06,11.74
"height. And now for sure, you must agree with me that this is gonna be overlooked on last but not least, we have the underline, which again we can use it. So let's say for this guy we were gonna change",21839.8,12.09
"it on the line. So let's write text. Ah, Decoration. Yeah, not text decoration. Yeah, like the correction. It was the underlying. And sure enough, we have It has an underlying",21851.89,12.8

"between. Let's say the screen or other elements on weaken. Just test it out first. No, you know what? I can just get rid of all these values on was gonna keep it simply by padding",22422.94,11.15

"I'm gonna uncommon right now. First patting on, let's do exactly the same thing where it was 20 pixels. Awesome. Everything is working really nice with the fatty. Well, what about the margins? Well, we have",22446.8,13.05
"the same options. Weaken right margin, and then we're again. We're looking forward. Marching bottom, marching left margin top. Maybe not. Let's test it out. All of the options. Let's just say first with",22459.85,11.37

"on the box number two just the way it is so here. I'm going to say like this. I'm going to say that I would like some padding and I'm gonna have padding all around. I'm going to say 20 pixels. Okay, so I'm",25507.06,12.1
"really noticing that my box is getting bigger. OK, let's do the same thing here. Let's say for the third box is also gonna be the same thing. And again, we're getting the bigger prodding. Want a lift inside",25519.16,13.14
"as well as we can see that it's happening on top of bottom. Now, if we really wanna actually check this out, we can head over to the bigger browser window. Or you can do it in a small side",25532.69,11.38
"browser window, really up to you. And then we can again refresh our weaken. Go to Google developer tools on. If I'm gonna click on Inspector, I'm gonna open up the tools I'm going to right away. Zoom in so we can see better",25544.07,12.16
on that was a little bit drastic. I didn't need to go that for but we can stay something I cannot pick the right angle. Um what's a head within the head? I'm not interested in anything,25556.62,11.87
". I don't know why Opened had actually needed body. Ah, me. Open up the body now Within the body. Have my boxes. What do you see here on the box? Now, if you can clearly see on the top I have",25568.94,13.85
"240 by 240. How are on my right hand side? It says 206 by 206. Again. Let me have a hold over back on. As I'm hovering over the elements, you can see that there has been",25583.18,12.29
"added some with and some height because we just had a departing because I said patting is going to be left and right and top and bottom. So what happens is even though originally it was 206 by 206. Now, in",25595.47,12.12
"fact, this is 240 by 240 because we added the padding. Okay, Don't believe me. Let's help over to box number three again. Same deal. So even though I'm having here right now",25607.59,12.02
", this 206 by 206 what's happening is on the page right now as I'm looking at again, this is 2 40 by 2 40 and we can also see this over here. So I have 206 by 206",25619.61,12.06
. But then my pad ings are being added on weapon Inside on right inside. It's obviously a different. And stay opposite the left inside in the right hand side as well. A stopping bottom. Now why,25632.03,12.5
"this matters? Well, has your gonna be working with CSS as you're going to be working with your layout? This is really gonna mess you up, especially if you tried to position something somewhere and",25644.53,12.2
"you just add a padding. And this is totally gonna mess up your layout, your view and probably most importantly, your mood, especially in the beginning. So when do we do about that? Well, let",25656.73,11.52
"me head over to the box number one over here and let's have the property that we just learned which was box sizing property on for the box sizing. We would like to have border box. Now, what",25668.25,11.72
"is Bordered Box? And you? Well, what happens with border box, Border box is right now and we can actually click on box number one and now check this out. Now, this is probably gonna be clear. But even though you can still see",25679.97,11.69
"it here, at least I can see it on my window. I can see that this is still 206 by 206. But I guess this is gonna be a little bit better. Were noticed. What happens now? The padding is added on inside, so",25691.66,11.45
"the content is actually 1 60 which again might mess you up your content within. But at least it's not Gunnel mess up your whole layout now. Is it the same thing with everyone well known, This is",25703.11,11.69
"still without a border box value. So what's happening is this is the reason why we're using the border box. And that's the reason why in the beginning, remember when we had that universal selector, when we said",25714.8,11.82
"that we would want to select everything on that was the Asterix. Then we're adding margin is gonna be zero. The default margins should begun, then also, the padding should be gone so",25726.63,11.54
"we could always add their own patterns. And that's why we added here just box sizing with a value of the border box. So that's why we said here border box. So no, all of them are exactly the same",25738.27,11.44
". The only difference right now with a one and three is the fact that the padding has beat added on inside. But the key is that if you're adding this property, it will not gonna mess up",25749.79,11.16
"your whole layout if you're adding padding to a element because batting is gonna be applied inside of the element, not the outside, making the element bigger. Well, we're still on a topic",25760.95,12.63
"off display property. Eventually, inevitably, as you working with he assists, you're gonna come across the A pass ity property as well as visibility on. You're going to see the",25773.58,11.15
"value for display property set to none. So why don't we cover all these properties with these values just so we can see the difference now within the indexation mouth, we will gonna create three",25784.73,11.58
"new there's I'm going to say there's gonna be Dev on The first one is gonna have a glass of none because we're gonna look at the class of none Hamlets I don't know right also, Maybe the name here on let's copy",25796.32,11.89
"and paste it Now, once we cap invested, I would like to select both of them on Let's right here. Opacity here is gonna be equal to one. So that's gonna be Mike last night as well as their how you, um as always",25808.21,11.74
"you'll see why we're doing that. Just in a second on. Let's right over here. Rapacity is gonna be I don't know, five on this is gonna be basically capacity of 0.5 on. Then the last",25819.95,11.94
"one is gonna be a pass ity. We had zero. So with me, some like this on now, this is gonna be my rapacity of with you. I also would like to have the div. And you know what matters Will copy and president. And let's set",25831.89,11.93
"this up with a hidden. So you know what? No. Let's give this a class of visibility. So the name is also gonna be visibility, but the value is going to hit. So these ability",25843.82,12.49
"hopefully, um, tapping this correctly. No, let me say that this is gonna be my dips. No. For each and every day. Let's again at there's always some general styles. It's a deer is gonna have some background. Background",25856.31,13.09
"is gonna be below. There's gonna be a little of a margin around, so I'm gonna say, I don't know, a little bit of margin off like, let's say thank pixels and run up the margin went and we had some coloring",25869.4,11.38
as well on Let's rate the color is gonna be one. So what's happening right now with these properties while we have the classes so I can say none on here? I would like to start using by display,25880.78,12.08
". Now, this is not gonna be display blogged the in Leinbach or inland. Instead, we're gonna set this up with that. And now let me first at all of them with a pass it ease and with visibilities And then I'm gonna",25893.13,11.18
"go over to the actual developer tools and then we'll see kind of the differences. So for now, what we're saying is that we have the class of none on display of none. We cannot see the element. And that is",25904.31,11.18
"true. Now what other options we're gonna have? Well, we had believe capacity. This is gonna be equal, Teoh. A actual a pass ity property on opacity property is gonna do something very similar",25915.49,11.85
"where this is going to control the visibility. Now, the max value is gonna be one which is gonna be by default, right away displayed. And then we have an option of zero, which is gonna make sure that the actual",25927.53,11.77
"class is not displayed, meaning the element or whatever. But we're since we're using the class to selected, the one that has zero is not gonna be displayed now. In this case, obviously I need to still like",25939.3,11.46
"the proper one. So if my class was zero notice, I'm having right away the Dave where we cannot see them. Because this is where again we're working with these values were rapacity is changing",25950.76,11.95
"Now, if you remember, it was something very similar. As we're working with the colors where we're using the RGB a value, remember, we had color and then the last value in RGB a was",25963.08,11.8
"the transparency or opacity. So the same thing is working here, just with the whole def were by default, all the capacities are going to be one. And that's why we don't need to write it on. We can see it clearly like",25974.88,11.71
"this hour. If we change it to zero, which would be the minimum value, Then we cannot see the Dave anymore. And also, I'm gonna have the value off five, which is gonna be zero for now. I'm not gonna",25986.59,11.97
"cover each. In fact, every value between zero and one. Just understand that we're just using right now around values because they just make a little bit more sense. But if I'm going to say 0.5",25998.56,11.7
"the opacity, the transparency off this live, it was gonna be like this. So it's gonna be somewhere between the middle off, totally hidden element as well as totally clear elements, because we're gonna",26010.55,10.99
"have the transparency of far. If I'm gonna change this 0.74 then my ample capacity goes bigger because in goes towards one, meaning I am less transparent if",26021.54,11.97
"I'm gonna go with 0.25 than the element is gonna be way more transparent because we're closer to one. So you're bouncing in between these two values zero and one, and whatever",26033.51,11.52
"value you're picking in her case 0.5, then the transparency is gonna be like this. Now, last. But at least we have here also the visibility and four days we had the class is the",26045.03,12.0
"ability on. We're gonna go with visibility property. I noticed what's happens with visibility. We have an option off hidden more. Aiken, head over here and again, we can have the hidden",26057.03,11.75
"or visible. Now the visible again is gonna be by default because all the elements are gonna be shown by default. But if you would wanna have hidden, then we're gonna have to Here. No, maybe in order to kind of see what's happening",26068.94,13.23
". Like I said, it's gonna be better if we're gonna go to developer tools just to see how everything is working. And then we're gonna head over here to inspect. We see that there's gonna be my elements on. Maybe I can",26082.64,11.44
make this a little bit bigger than within the body. Noticed what's gonna happen. So I will gonna have my display of none. Then I have my capacity of one as well as here. We're working with,26094.08,11.88
"a capacity of 0.5 and then I have the opacity of zero as well as I have my visibility. Now. What would be the key difference you see, has we're working with display of none. This",26105.97,11.63
"is taken out out of the flow so we cannot even see it here. How are as I'm hovering over the capacity, I see that there's an element, So the element is there. We just cannot see it right",26117.6,11.25
"now in the browser. How old were display of none was taking totally out of the flow of our documents. So even though I can see it technically that it is in the HTML, I cannot hover over",26128.85,11.77
", I cannot select it. I cannot see it more in more detail. Hold with opacity Onley thing we're doing as well as visibility were hiding that element. We're not taking out out",26140.82,10.58
"of the normal flow off the doctor, so those would be the key differences. If you want to totally get rid of the element you would use display of none. So maybe head over, Let's back. We have the display of none that would",26151.4,17.4
"totally take it out off the floor with document, if you would want to. Let's say change the opacity. Change transparency. You would use the opacity and choose some kind of value between zero and one",26168.81,5.32
". And if you just want to hide it, you'd say visibility of hidden. So those are the properties. Those are the values, and that is, in general how we would use them. At this point, we already know how to add background colors",26174.44,12.13
"in CSS. Well, what about images as backgrounds. I think it would be really cool if we would learn that not only will learn how to use background image properties, we're also gonna take a closer look",26186.58,11.69
"at short hands Index, which, in essence, we're going to save us the unnecessary typing. Okay, Our next subject is really, really interesting. And that is gonna be the background",26198.28,11.29
"how we can add background in RC Asus as an image. Now, in order to start working on this, we're gonna have to get images. So I would like to spend this video with the set up. Now, you don't",26209.84,17.25
"have to follow along. You could just go three sources and get everything that I'm gonna be doing this video. But I do want to show you again to repeat where we're getting images on, we can save them",26227.09,4.89
"and how we can crop them now before I do anything right now with images, Let me just delete my CSS. Soc says it's gonna be clear as well as in the next session of mouth. We're going to get",26231.98,11.78
"rid of all these dibs that we did use in the previous video. Okay, Awesome. We also can delete this guy. We don't need it. The photo is gonna go. Bye bye on",26243.76,12.58
", then. Yeah. What's going? Look for images on You know what? I don't need the council. I don't think we will need it on. Let's open up the new tab again. We can use picks, obey or pixels. I'm gonna go with pixels",26256.34,12.29
". What kind of image we could be looking for. Let's say we're gonna get this one. This is kind of interesting. And again, the way we'll do that, we're gonna save image as, and then we're looking for where we're saving this. So in",26269.09,17.61
"this case, I'm gonna call this big image. Now, you don't have to technically name with this way, But there's the reasoning behind this. So again, this is really up to you. I'm going to say that this is gonna be big. Then",26286.7,5.82
another image that I'm gonna be looking for is gonna be Let's say this guy on again. We're gonna do saving me jazz on. I'm gonna call this one small again name and how are you? Would like and I'm gonna name it,26292.53,11.61
"this way. And then what else we have? I guess we can maybe work with the actual building here, let's say save image as now the key here is gonna be that",26304.14,11.85
"I would like to create a folder and then I'm going to save this image in the folder. So I'm gonna call this first of all folder image That's gonna be my name. And then first, I would like to create a new folder. And again, this is just to",26316.06,11.77
"show you something How we would get the path here. Let's say I am G or images doesn't really matter going to create it. And then I'm gonna say with within this folder, hopefully you were successful. Now I'm",26327.83,19.07
"gonna head over to my folder, and I would like to crop the small image. So the one that's in the images folder as well as the big, big image can stay the same but the small. When I would",26346.9,5.64
"like to actually crop it and not in the photo shop, I'm just gonna do it the quick way in the actual Mac. Something to say within the tools I would like to adjust the size on",26352.54,11.97

"Ah, I am. I am gonna make this proper one. I am big image and with make up in pace this on, let's say 123 then",26412.69,13.62
"the second one is gonna be the small. So it's a small image. The third one is gonna be the folder image again. Kind of straightforward. This is gonna be the small image, and you probably right. You can guess what we're gonna",26426.43,12.04
"be doing anyway. So it's a small image on then the last one is gonna be the holder image. So I am Holder Image. Nice to meet you. Okay, Index html Done. Awesome. Let's",26438.47,12.74

"say height is not gonna be two pixels had actually would be. I don't know. Let's test it out by 406 pixels. All right, I think that's gonna be a little bit too drastic here. Let's covered 306",26468.69,6.12
"pixels. Maybe that's gonna be bigger. Well, at the moment, it's still kind of big. But you know what? It's obviously the fact that I am working with the browser window on. I have zoomed in a locked so not",26474.81,11.3
"there. I'm gonna zoom in there, but zoom out over here because I always want you to see a little bit better so I can see that I kind of went a little bit drastic where I had 1 75 So in this case",26486.11,11.63

", what I would like. First of all, it's a collective background. Now it's gonna be the first step then for the background. The value in this case is going to be a girl. This is where the difference comes in. We're not placing the color. Were",26533.15,12.6
"writing the girl now within the URL, we need to show the path. So where this image is located now, where is this image located? The big image. Well, it's in exactly the same folder as",26545.75,12.17
"our style CSS. So it's very simply we can just look for the big image that I'm going to do in the forward slash on. In this case, this would be the big image. Now, we can also let me just say that first",26557.92,11.72
"of all, just so you can see that there's gonna be an image. But let's look at the other options we had. We obviously could have done it like this could have said like this. This would still gonna work. But again, please remember, it's going to depend whether",26569.64,17.8

"you pick, it's really up to you. Okay? We have the background Now, with all my yammering about the actual path, I didn't tell you that. Basically, we're getting the image. So that's the need point where",26674.53,12.52
"we have the background right now on the background is in fact, image. If I'm gonna make this bigger, still notice we're gonna have a nice image. Now, there's gonna be a couple things that are happening by default, and that is something",26687.05,11.8
would see assess where some of the things you already have noticed Let let's say display properties. They already precept. No. One of the things that we're gonna again cover in a few videos is the fact that this is,26698.85,11.72

"look in general. Then let's do small image. Remember, that was the other one on again. You know what in this case? Maybe Allegis Copy and pasted. There is no reasoning for me to",26722.84,12.69
"not copy and pasted because I think it's going to say it was a little bit of time so it's a small image. So I'm gonna be looking for the small guy on Check this out. So I'm gonna change this. And again, this is",26735.7,11.95
"in the same folder, so I don't care. I can just use small J peg. And what do we see or hear? Well, we see that literally. The images repeated not only the X direction visible",26747.65,11.87
I direction again. That is something that's happening by default. So it will get a matter what kind of image you're making. Because I'm sorry using because the reason why I wanted to show the small image,26759.52,12.37
is that even though we were gonna cover later on the properties that affect this So technically we could get the same look where the small images still going to be covering on hold if it's,26772.19,11.21
"gonna be distorted and it's not gonna be very pretty. So it doesn't matter what kind of image you're picking, so please don't pick like an image off 25 25 then wonder Well, why my image looks so bad or why",26783.4,11.24
"does it doing this repetition? Because that is something that's happening by default on. I know that's quite a lot that you kind of have to remember that. OK, they display properties by default. This",26794.64,11.5

". That was the big one. Let's say small and I don't know why I deleted the image. Could have just said with folder. Now, I don't want to use the small one. Now I have to look into folder now the reason here",26818.46,12.59
"again wants to show you that we need to use the path. So we have to use the path where we're looking for the images, then within images what we have. Well, we have folder image",26831.05,11.84

"on here. I would like to work with the RGB A So that's the reason we restart by 0.3. So this is kind of transparent on we go all the way to 0.9, which is almost",28568.13,11.49

"be any brighter, it's gonna be much more hard to see the text. So the solution we can do is we can place an overlay using the linear Grady. So how this is gonna work out? Well, I'm gonna show you this. However",28878.72,12.36
", I'm going to show you this on the second one on the header just so we can see the difference personal. And I'm also going to show you how we can shortcut this because you're probably looking at this and you're like, this is really annoying",28891.08,11.5
". Were technically really typing for properties here with the values. So isn't there a shorter way how we can do that? And since it is success, yes, there is a shorter way. So in this case, we're",28902.75,11.11
"gonna say had her. So I'm gonna say we're going to start looking for the Hatter. So that would be of my first thing. I can let me set up a nice curly braces and then what I would want for that matter, Well, I'm going to start the same thing",28913.86,11.89
". But instead of right away going with an image, we have an option off adding the linear ingredient. So let's start here. Let's say that there's gonna be living here, great in. And now I would like to decide on a color. No",28925.75,12.3
". Well, what kind of colors we can have? I guess we can start with maybe black one. Maybe this is gonna make this image less bright so we know that we can have rgb a Then we need to have",28938.05,12.16

"error on here. We're gonna say you are l since this is where we're gonna be looking for damages. Now, I'm gonna look for either the folder or we can maybe look for the same image just so we can see the difference. I think",29053.91,11.34
"that would be actually better, because that way we can see one image is not gonna have the linear ingredient. And the second one that would have the linear grated. Now the image again was big Jipping. So forward slash then",29065.25,11.26
"would look before the big Jake bag, and now we're gonna have damage. Now the question would be you would say, Well, first of all, you can right away see the difference. So we have one that's gonna have no over early in the second one where the text",29076.51,11.36
"is much more clear because we have added the overly. Now, this obviously is not some kind of set overlay that you always need to use. You can use whatever color you would like. Like",29087.87,11.74
"I said before. But in my case, I'm just showing you with this kind of value just to show you that it is darker on again. This is really up to you. If you want to use the yellow color as over like you can use the yellow",29099.61,11.24

"the reason why you have these rgb a value now. Lastly I would want to show you is how we can shorten this because for now you would be thinking OK, so I have all this. I have the URL. Everything is looking really well",29122.86,11.37
", meaning the image. But I still need to add the cover No repeat center and all that, because right now I have two images, so I would like to fix that. Now we can technically right, this soul out and there's nothing wrong with that",29134.35,11.17
. But we have a shorter way. So here we can write that the image is gonna be always in a center because we have the position of center. And you know what? Maybe let me kind of put them in order how I'm putting them,29145.7,11.59
"here. So we have the center. Then we're gonna have forward slash on the cover so I can use this, and then we would need to write what we would like to do. So I'm gonna say no. Repeat, on this is gonna",29157.3,11.96
"be fixed here like this. And what happens? Well, we have added all these properties without writing, actually, properties just by adding the values. Now, be careful here. You can",29169.26,12.86
"change this order. So let's say I could save no fixed, and then I'm gonna write No, Repeat. So this is gonna work. Fine. How are don't mix these two up? Don't say it like theirs. Don't say cover",29182.18,12.45
"on, then center Because notice what's gonna happen? Little damage is not gonna be sure. So these do, guys, if you're writing them, just make sure that you right, center, then we have forward slash And then we're using",29195.18,12.55
the color on that way. You know for sure that your image is always gonna be shown. This is basically how this is gonna look like might be mixed save. And I think it looks awesome. I think the little looks really good,29207.73,11.91

"because there is the one on the right. The left one is still not being taken care of. So in this case, if you would want to avoid that, we would say clear both. And now we finally have a paragraph",29856.93,11.84

"where we want them side by side. So we like to look how everything looks. Okay, so we have floated here this month is left. So this was fine or you don't want to the right. We can delay in the second one. We don't need it",29929.88,17.56
"anymore on. We also don't need to clear property. Let's say that this is exactly how we would want would want them side by side. Now, what we can always do nicely is to have some kind of margin. So for number one",29947.44,5.84

"I don't know what what we could do. Green. What do you think? Yeah, I think green is gonna be fine. Okay, so we have number two, and then we have the class of special Now for the class of special. Let's just add",30535.91,12.14

"of them were text a line to the left. But if you set the parent through some kind of, let's say text align right, then you use this default one well, the same with the position static. If you're going to use them. Quite a",30617.67,11.85

". I can say position, and I'm not going to use a relative. I'm going to use static. You'll notice that nothing is gonna change because by default all of them having this position static. So that's the reason why everything",30641.22,11.86
"stays the same. Thankfully, position relative is much more exciting than the position static on. Maybe we can test it out. So we have right now, maybe d the class of one. So",30653.08,11.68
"we have a dead with a class one man, we can, I think, work on this guy. So let's say we have position and we already know that we have an option for the static. Now, the moment we save it was position relative",30664.76,11.56
". You know, there's nothing changes we might be tempted to say. Okay, so it's pretty much like, however you would be a tiny bit wrong because with a position relative would weaken. Do is weaken",30676.57,12.15
"said it relative to its normal position. So whenever it was sitting normally and flow, we can actually adjust that. Now we can do that with four properties on the first one is gonna be top",30688.72,11.68
". So let's say relative to a top word mishearing. So in our case, what we can do, we can say, I don't know, For example, 50 pixels. When Athens is, I moved it 50 pixels away",30700.63,11.89
"from where it was sitting relatively with its normal position. So now it's sitting basically 50% or I'm sorry, 50 pixels down. No one can use multiple values here. We can say, let's say",30712.83,11.45
"maybe Rpm's. So for the left one, I'm going to use, like, 20 rpm's, so not only were gonna place it 50 pixels down relative to where it was normally also, we're gonna",30724.28,12.61
"dio 20 rpm's left from where it was sitting relatively. Now, since I would like to use multiple values, I'm going to say I don't know, right. He's gonna be now, I don't know, 50%",30736.89,12.19
". And I was like, This is gonna be more to now We're also using the stop one. So maybe that wouldn't be the best example where we have already left one, and then we're using the right one. So why don't we do this when",30749.09,11.7
"we come in this out? And now we're gonna move it to the right now This way, we're pushing it relatively. So where was sitting normally? Ah, 50% from the right. Now, also, we have the bottom",30760.79,12.28
so we could push it from the vitamin again within doing the same thing where Top is gonna be commented out. And then we're gonna work with the bottom and for the bottom. I don't know. We had Ari EMS. We had percent. I guess we can again,30773.37,11.09
"do with the pixels. It doesn't really matter. So I can just say to 206 pixels. And now we pretty much moved it away from the screen. So maybe in let's not be that drastic, we can also do 20 pixels",30784.46,11.49
. And now we just moved 20 pixels relative off where it was sitting up because moved it 20 pixels from the bottom. And that's how we can work with position relative in the CSS,30796.19,12.01
"A. Okay, if you thought that position relative waas somewhat fun. Wait till you meet position. Absolute. Which is, in my opinion, a real rock star in",30809.25,10.6
"the CSS. What do I mean by that? Well, let's take a closer look. First, I would like to get her of this relative, or we could just delete it may be all together later on, actually, throughout",30819.85,11.91
"this video and added back. But for now, just to show you how everything is gonna work, I will gonna delete this position relative. Where does position absolute come into play first? I'm going to go to the special One says",30831.76,12.12
this was the reason why we added it and then let's a position here. Since this is our option position on then for position. We're not gonna go with the relative. We're gonna go for absolute,30843.88,12.07
"No, once we save it. Noticed what happens already. We're having some interesting changes. Okay, So far, so good. So what's happening? Well with position absolute were also placing",30856.54,12.57

"exist, then it places itself relative to the body number four checking here in the indexation. Mel, how many answers there's does? This span has what has the first one? The parent",30881.55,11.89
"with the class of number two. There it has the Dave, which is the second one. And then, since none of them have position relative that it looks for the body. Now you don't believe me. Let's test it up. So here",30893.79,11.97
"we go in the right top. Since again, these are properties for the manipulation of the position on, Let's say for the top is gonna be here because we can have any kind of value on. We can also add zero",30905.76,11.3
"So let's say top zero on right is also gonna be zero. And let's see what's gonna happen on what happened. Well, the absolute special. So the special class way of position",30917.27,12.94
"absolute moved all the way to the top right corner off the body. Because, like I said, if there's gonna not gonna be an ancestor, that basically is gonna work as a position relative",30930.21,11.94

"technically not sitting in the center. That is correct, because we would need to shift a little bit the position of this element. However, this is close enough for the center for us, just to show you that",31061.64,11.4

"on but as you're scrolling, is going to stay in that position. Excellent. Our CSS journey finally has led us to media queries on the reason why media queries are so so cool",31358.14,11.37
"in the CSS is because they allow us to work with responsive design. And in a nutshell, they allow us to style elements depending on the screen signs, so we can have different styles",31369.52,17.76
"on different screen sizes. On with the project, there's obviously going to be more complicated examples with column sizes on all kinds of things. How are for now? I'll just want to show you the basics example",31387.28,5.75

"can be the same properties with different values. This is really up to you. So let's start here. Let's say body. So starting from 5 76 what is gonna happen to the body? Well, designer suggests me",31632.08,12.19
"that the body shouldn't be background. Right. Okay, that's a good start. Then I'm gonna be looking for a different background for the main, so I'm gonna say nothing. Main Sorry, banner. So I'm gonna write for the banner. We would want background",31644.27,13.02

"is gonna be black on that. I'm gonna be looking for the font size so fun size is gonna be out of no. Ah, 60 pixels. Basically, this is gonna be massive. Okay? We don't see anything. There's no changes",31669.59,13.91

the moment we're gonna get past 5 76 then we're gonna be getting new stuff. Now you want to see it a little bit more We can do. Obviously has always our development ALS on what happens here,31707.31,12.11
"on the right hand corner. You are probably seeing here the actual with of the screen. Now, what's happening here? This is saying 5 76 now, the reason why this is happening, because",31719.43,12.04

"it's easier if we're gonna go actually again, back to develop portals. You'll see that this is actually happening from 5 76 with me again. Make the smaller then we can do. And this is not what I wanted to",31748.72,5.98
"dio, Um, my apologies. We would need to go to 1 27 Then I'm going to open up my developer tools, and then we can start looking here. That's starting from 5 76 The",31754.7,12.83
"changes are gonna happen. Well, there's actually a little bit better way in developer tools, so we can notice that. So let me first Magnus again. Probably bigger on. You know what? I can just make this",31767.53,11.26
"1 May be smaller on. Do you know what? What I would want? Well, here I would like to zoom in. I'm not over here, but in actual document. So it's zoom into 206 then in the developer tools, notice",31778.79,12.97
"what we're gonna have. So we're gonna have the little thing where we could be looking at the screen sizes? No, What I have read I have the width of 406 and then off height of 509. No, if",31791.76,12.86
"I'm gonna be expanding this, check it out. So starting from 5 76 was gonna happen. We're gonna see that we're gonna have our changes. So those are the kind of two things that, if you would need to know that within",31804.62,12.08
"the developer tools, if you want to check it out on different screen sizes, you have this option. You don't have to do the normal way. How are Even if you're not doing this with screen sizes, you're still gonna be able",31816.7,11.17
"to see just gonna be hard to see, because is gonna be probably written in a small tent or something like this. Now back to the media queries. You know what? Let me just close the verbal tours and let's take for",31827.87,11.48
"this one now on. Like I said within the media query, if I'm not adding this text decoration, underline If I'm not overriding this in 5 76 what happens is",31839.35,13.5
"that the underlying still state. So even though I said that starting from 5 76 I would want some different property values on the heading one, because I didn't",31852.85,11.7
"have this text decoration other line here, This is the reason why it still stays on also have an option of adding the new property. However, this new property with 60 pixels is only gonna work",31864.55,11.52
from that 5 76 the moment we're gonna be again back to the small screen. This is not gonna work now. We also have an option of adding as many media queries would like. So how this is gonna work,31876.07,11.62
"? Well, you just copy and paste int. And you know what? Before we do, let me just do a little bit off undoing. Let me show you where would be the mistake. So what if I'm gonna do it like this? What I'm going to say",31887.7,12.55
", media screen on, then in between the end on the actual parentheses. I'm not gonna leave any kind of space. Do you think the media query is gonna work? Or remember what I told you is that even",31900.52,11.33
the smallest mistake is gonna make that big difference. Now check this out. It doesn't matter how big the screen size gets the media queries not working and weaken refresh all day long on this is not gonna,31911.85,12.21
"change on The reason for that is because the smallest syntax error in this case, even a simple is just leaving on this place on pretty much everything is gonna be messed up. Now, I",31924.06,11.78
can tell you right away my biggest issue is always writing something like this. So I do it something like this and that I'm looking for three days. Where is my B A query? And I'd understand whether it's a browser school or,31935.84,10.89
"anything like that, because obviously, my spelling is not the best. So I always have issues with the with. That's just something from my book to let you know to maybe you so you can avoid it on",31946.73,12.39
". Now let's go back and let's say add another one. And now this is gonna be the kicker where even this is gonna be starting from men with 5 76 In this case, I obviously would want to have some",31959.48,11.28
bigger screen size. So let's say this is not gonna be seven. I'm sorry. 5 76 we're gonna say 7 68 So once we get to 7 68 then we're gonna flip it around again. So here,31970.76,13.08
"we can do green again. for the body. The background for the banner is gonna be blue again. Ah, the color I don't know Could be read, read And maybe let's add some",31983.84,11.97
Another property here. But I'm just thinking what kind of property I could add with a text. Maybe. Let's do text the line on not center we can do Maybe right. And that's gonna work out or,31995.81,13.23
"you know it even more fun one with at a phone family off Perdana. So the moment we're gonna get to 7 68 then we're gonna get over Don, let me double check whether I corrected my mistakes",32009.04,11.46
"that I did it on purpose. Otherwise, this is obviously I'm gonna work on. We're gonna head over right now to the bigger browser window. So we have less than 5 76 the moment we get past 5 76 and obviously",32020.5,11.49
"again, in my case, 85 zoomed in. This is obviously going to be on a bigger screen size. But as I came going, notice what happens the moment we get to 7 76 I have all",32031.99,11.82
kinds of things happening here. I have done. I have text right on. I have the backgrounds and everything. All that on this is again to show you that this is how we would work with media queries,32043.81,11.12
"again. Very, very basic example. Throughout the projects, we're gonna be using a lot more different properties on this is gonna look much better, but the general idea would be like this. Now, we also have",32055.24,11.84
"an option of Max with no for the max with Let me just flip this around. So first of all, I'm just gonna comment this out, and then what we would want is the same syntax how we're gonna right",32067.08,11.6
"Max with now how the max with is gonna work. Well, the Max with is saying up to So we technically flip this around since we already had here the",32078.68,12.58
"rules, whatever the CSS properties and values we are saying here, up to this 5 76 we were gonna have these values. So these are gonna be the values don't be shown. However, if",32091.27,12.16
we're gonna get past 5 76 notice what happened. So these are original styles that we wrote. So what we're saying here is up to the 5 76 then we're gonna go back to whatever styles,32103.43,12.65
"we wrote over here. Now, one thing that we need to be careful with Max with is that we can easily overwrite this. So if I'm gonna come in this out again and if I'm going to say Max with from 7 68",32116.08,11.73
"and again, let me select this here. Let's say Max on this is not what I wanted to dio with. Same. Relax with No. Once I write 7 68 what do you think is gonna happen right now? I'm",32128.25,13.79
writing here up to 5 76 then I have another Max with 7 68 So if I'm writing here up to 7 68 do you think which style is gonna be shown on,32142.04,12.22
"the screen or render in the browser? Well, we can already see him right inside. That this is gonna be this 7 68 And again, the reasoning for that would be that we're saying Max with 45",32154.26,12.04
"76 but 7 68 includes this. So we're overriding in any way what we're saying is okay. Yeah, You said 5 76 But what I'm saying is that I would like to have",32166.3,12.22
"the 7 68 But again, the interesting thing over here is, even if I'm gonna change it here on, if I'm going to say I don't know 40 pixels, I'm still gonna be getting this value. So even though",32178.52,11.71
"I'm writing here 7 68 I'm overriding this. I don't know the font size, right, so that's what's happening. But let's test it out with some kind of property that maybe is not affected in the banner",32190.23,11.86
". Now, we already know the border radius, border, radius, hand That could be an unknown 20 pixels. No one's. I say with this is what happens. So that banner, even though it is Max with",32202.46,12.39
"up to 5 76 we're still getting this right now, the border radius because we're not overriding it over here. So this is gonna happen with properties that we overriding on. This is the",32214.86,11.36
"case where you need to be really careful. So if you're gonna have some kind of properties here that you're not overriding this 7 68 then they're obviously still gonna be shown, so that's something",32226.22,11.65
that you need to pay attention to. Another interesting doozy is a Z index in the CSS on. What we're gonna do is we're gonna set up some example with some images just,32237.87,11.29
so we can see a little bit better on four days. You know what I will going to get her of all this mumbo jumbo that we had before in the cirrhosis four star going to save it on in the indexation email,32249.16,11.44
". We were going to create maybe the same thing. We can leave the Dev, but within the Dev, we're gonna have some images. Now, we're going to start with small one first and it doesn't really matter because we're gonna be",32260.78,10.98
"changing the sizes on. Let's say here, I'm gonna be looking for the image. Now I'm going to start with small one so I can just say small J Peg and let me out the class because we will gonna be adding some",32271.76,11.71
"changes individually by each of the images. So let's copy and paste it. First of all, let's say class of number two and we're gonna be locked in four class and number three Ah, what else",32283.47,12.18
"we can have. Okay, so we have small. We obviously also want the big one. So I'm gonna say Big J peg. And then let's look for the folder and again, just for simple reason that I would want them to be different. And",32295.65,12.75
"then, you know, this was obviously enough in a folder between images. And then we're looking for folder image. First things first we will need to fix. Obviously the withs here the heights are just massive. So let's",32308.4,11.47
"say for all the images I would like to have, I don't know with off 206 pixels, let's try it out with 206 pixels and right away the height also for 206 pixels",32319.87,11.29
", and we'll see what happens. So 208 106 on this is Obviously I mess up is not what I want. Let's go back over here and let's save it. And now we have 206 by 206. So far",32331.6,12.56
", so good. Um, you know what? Maybe it's not so far so good, because let's do maybe 106 pixels, because that way this is gonna look a little bit more decent. It's okay. 106 by hundreds. Now",32344.16,12.72
", this is gonna look good. Um, what else I would like? Well, for now, let's just work with the Div. Let's say for the day of or maybe let's a banner. Since we have the class authority, I would want to have some margin",32356.88,12.31
". Now, the margins are gonna be, like 20 pixels around, so there's gonna be some margin on I would like to add some with What's a 70 view with? No, it's gonna be my with",32369.8,12.96
"as well as some height with some I don't know, 70 viewers. So 70 view hurts when save it. So this would be men live and let me add the border right now on for the border",32383.15,12.54
", I would like to add, I don't know, five pixels, so",32396.1,3.89
"solid on. Let's go with the red. So something like this just so we can see where the Davis actually sitting. Excellent. You know what, though? One thing missing we can maybe do with",32409.67,1.06
"off little bit whiter. So this is going to look a little bit better now. What? Well, now let's test it out. Something else we're gonna say position. And since we already have covered position absolute, let's see how this is gonna",32410.74,11.52
"look like. So what I'm saying for old images, no gonna have the position absolute. And again, we have already covered this. So now they're just sitting here now. We haven't added position relative yet, so that's maybe something",32422.26,11.98
we should do because we know that we have ancestor on 40 answers there. We would like to have position relative on at the moment. What I would like is to control them one by one. So since I have a class is,32434.24,12.01
"there is gonna be the image with a class of one on, then image with obviously class of 213 And let's just first start by positioning them. So for the image number one, I'm going to say top is gonna",32446.6,11.59
"be zero on left is gonna be zero. Then what else we're gonna have? No, let's just copy and paste it. I would say two and three on then. Also here we would need to change different classes",32458.19,12.52
". Then here, organ right number three and then here are gonna have different positions. So let's say, for number two, I would 1 10% 10% from the top 10 person from the left, same thing",32471.24,12.01
Or here can do 10% from the left on. You know what for this guy? Maybe 20% from up on 20% from the left. On the moment we say,32483.25,12.68
"what happens? Well, we're noticing that we're having the images. We have the image number one, then the image number two on the magic number three on. As we're looking at it, we can see that the third one",32495.93,12.58
"is closer to us now. The reason for that is very simple, because this was the third image. But this would be the easy next that were controlling with I'm sorry. The Z axis that were controlling",32508.88,20.81
would seen on the reason why the third one is gonna be the closer because the actual image was the third in line on the first one Waas further away or is further,32529.69,3.42
"away because it was first one in the line. So how we could change that? Well, we know that we have the option of working with Z Index that would control this Z axis on",32533.11,11.93
". Why don't we test it up? Why don't we have a look of how this is gonna work? So let's say for number one, we would want to work with the next No. One thing that I would need to let you know right away is that",32545.05,11.38
"with the index automatically, you're gonna be getting zero, so all of them, by default, are gonna have zero. So even though I'm gonna add for the 1st 10 nothing is gonna change because the rest",32556.43,11.68
"of them also right away of the Z next of zero. So instead of what I would like to do, either I need to go bigger new zero. So in my case, I could go toe one on. Check this out. Now",32568.11,11.56
", my first one is actually closer to us because we increase this zine next value on the Z next property war. We could do something like this if we know that all of them",32579.67,11.43
"are by default, zero. In a way, it doesn't really matter. I can just say that this was going to stay zero, which again would be the default on. Then we can say See next, negative one. So that would be for the",32591.1,11.44
"this guy on, then, For the third one, this is gonna be seen. Next number two, So is the index, and we can just go negative. Now, what do we see? We see that the first one. Even though they shouldn't be like that",32602.65,11.86
", normally he is displayed closer to us. Then the second one is further a little bit away on the third one were controlling here with the next of negative too. So this one is",32614.51,11.85
"further and further away. And like I said, even if I'm gonna come on the sell by default, this is how it works with Z next zero. So that's that's the reason why this is gonna be displayed closer. Now we're gonna have all",32626.37,11.46
"kinds of values here. It doesn't really matter. You can write something like this 999. As long as this value on Obviously, this is the case. If you want to place this one behind the element",32637.83,11.64
"number two is more negative than this guy. So instead, if I'm gonna write, let's say 909 on this one, we're gonna say 910. Then you can already guess what's",32649.47,11.62
"gonna happen. So now the third image is gonna be displayed closer to us than the one that is number two. Because we changed the Z index values. However, there is one kicker about",32661.09,11.72
"dizzy next, and that is the simple fact that it will only gonna work if you're gonna have position, relative or position. Absolute meaning, It's not gonna work with position static. So let's",32672.81,11.63
"have a look at how this is gonna work on in our case, what we could do. Well, we're gonna go back again to negative one as well as negative, too. Let's do it. Something like this, and this would be no good. Have to",32684.44,12.44
". You can save it. And you know what? Maybe let's flip it around and let's say that we would want I don't know, to be shown. Okay, So how this is gonna work? Well, we can do I don't know position",32697.24,11.95
"static. Right? Because we added the port. All the images. We added this position. Absolute. So what if why don't we go back? And why don't we say that Ford and number two, we would like to add position static",32709.19,11.95
". Okay, so far, so good. So this image is still gonna be in front. But then what's in this case? We're gonna change this, and we're going to say that you know what? The Z next is not gonna be negative, but",32722.27,11.6
"instead we're gonna go with a positive on. We're also gonna go with this guy being positive so we can do something like this. So now again, we have pretty much the default look like we've had anyway. But you know what I would",32733.87,11.72

", 109 pixels, top bottom and auto left and right, so I know that I'm gonna have it here somewhere in the middle. Now, I also would like to add maybe a let's say border. So it's a border",33322.839,12.28

"fit here. So what we can do is with an image. So since this is already responsive, we can add the 109%. So what's happening right now is the image is going to be responsive, depending",33358.769,13.46
"on a div. Meaning as I'm gonna increase the size off the Dev. Also, my image isn't gonna increase because I already set this up with 109 percent. So if we're gonna",33372.23,11.89

the moment we say with nothing changes on the North to get rid of this annoying space in between let's say what you're gonna have in the Dev as well as the image we're gonna have to make their,33406.96,10.59
"display property. And we're gonna straight display, not in line, but we're gonna have to display block. And this has nothing to do with before and after pseudo elements. This has everything to do with how",33417.55,11.149

"as well as we're gonna set it as display block. Now, we definitely don't have to do it. We could have avoided that. But by showing you this, I believe that I'm going to save you a little bit of time. Because",33451.199,10.85

input? Not obviously. I'm going in my paragraph right now because I already have selected all the paragraphs. Let me fix this. Let's say there's gonna be heading one. And now you're gonna be able to style actually,33473.55,11.74
"on the basic selection instead of what would happen if you're gonna remove this player bark What you're gonna see there's gonna be this extra margin of the extra space, and you're gonna be",33485.3,11.3

"again, we would just need to use display on this play block. Got nothing to do with the other elements. Everything has to do with how we're gonna be later on working with our dibs on how they're",33507.839,11.09
"gonna be interacting with images within the there's no. Okay, so we have covered this one. Now, let me get her of this, um, border. We don't need this on. Now. Let's decide what we're gonna do. Well, we can",33518.93,13.11
"start working with before and after. Now, the temptation would be like this. We'll have the image. And I would like to insert something here in between the image so I could just say image before",33532.05,11.61
"and let's go for the content. And let's start very simply by internal content on the continent is gonna be Hello. Now, the moment we say that nothing happens on the reason why nothing happens because",33543.98,11.82
"image element and I'm really shortened this. There's obviously big theory behind this and all that. But in general terms, image is already the continent because again",33556.14,10.84

"is the content, so we're not gonna be able to do that. Long story short, you're not gonna be able to add before and after a four year image. This was one of the reasons why we added the Dev. Because we do want to work",33578.6,11.49
"with these two developments now in the process. I also showed you other things about how the deals with images are gonna be interacting. But in general, you're not gonna be successful. So",33590.09,20.75
"I mean, I can repeat this 10 more times, but this is not gonna work. So far, so good. We have covered this. What else we have left? Well, why don't we actually look how weaken insert the before and",33611.05,2.52
"after as we having the Devon image now for the divers is actually very simple. We do have the content. Don't say, Dave. Beef war low their body on what I would like or, you",33613.57,12.22
"know, I know I need to have the content. I'm gonna say content. And even though there's gonna be something else, I'm just gonna say the empty country. So what else? I would like you. Well, I'm gonna say border is gonna be two pixels",33625.83,12.26
"solid on. Let's go with great one. Okay, so for now, I'm having this guy, so there's some kind of border. Okay, Why don't I make this interesting. I know that there's someone with and there's",33638.44,11.54
"some kind of height, and I know that I have the deal. So why don't I make it do with to be not some pixels? Not some absolutely. But also 109% as well as why don't make it. Height",33649.98,21.69
"1%. So you just say here height 1%. Now, the moment we save it got nothing strangers. Okay? But we already know the position Absolute right. So I could just say position",33671.95,4.22
"is gonna be absolutely. And then let's see what happens. Not a relative, but absolute What happens? Well, now this is really big. Okay, Probably not something that we wanted. What",33676.23,12.67
"else we can do? Well, we remember that whenever we were working with position absolute, this was looking for one. Well, for the first ancestor that had what? The position of relative? Because otherwise",33688.9,12.74
", this is looking for the body. That's the reason why this is so massive. So what would be the solution while we have the ancestor, the ancestor would be live in this case on what we can do is position",33701.73,11.67
", and we're looking for relatives. Now what happens is that this is gonna be 109% now. You could might be arguing. You can say, Well, this is not really 109%. Because what's happening right now you cannot. You can see",33713.84,11.48
"these spaces here, and the reason for that again is going to be the border box so we can have block sizing are not box shadow. For some reason, this is popping up and we'll, by the way, color box shadow",33725.32,10.92
". So that's gonna be covered. But if I'm gonna go with box sizing, notice this one. So right now I'm having the actual border box on. What's really cool is that this is exactly like",33736.24,12.17
I would have him when I did. So you noticed the idea. So we added this two pixels and now this is gonna be 109% 109 height and then this way we can start actually doing some more interesting,33748.41,11.69
"things. Now, what would be the more interesting things? Well, we know that we can place the relative relative honestly to Arran sister on Also, we can use the negative values. So how",33760.1,12.75
this is gonna work so I could say top is gonna be negative. 40 pixels. So we're gonna lift it up a little bit as well as left is gonna be negative. 40 pixels. So where this guy's gonna go,33772.85,11.14
"? Well, now, this is gonna be sitting right here. One annoying thing you might be looking at your like. Yeah, Well, okay. It looks kind of cool. But why is this covering the image right now? Well, you don't want",33784.34,11.24
"occurring image. What do we have? What property we had and I already actually showed you. So probably the easy answer would be, Well, Z index. Right. So what is the scene next? Right now for damage? Well",33795.58,11.16
", that's actually automatically zero. But if I'm gonna make for this guy negative to what happens Well, now this is gonna be hidden behind the image. Okay. So far, so good. Why don't we take",33806.74,11.4
"a look at the after one on here? I'm going to do something like this. I'm going to say Dev after now. In this case, I would like to copy and paste a lot of them because I don't want to rewrite them on one by one",33818.14,11.35
", someone's going to say something like this. And now let's change the values. So we have did before and after content. Is this going to stay the same empty? How old here? I'm not gonna be looking for the border. I'm going to say that there's",33830.09,20.97
"gonna be actual background, so not a border gray bod. We're gonna say background gray, So background is gonna be great. Now, what is gonna happen here? Well, for now, we're gonna cover everything because obviously",33851.06,3.57
"the within high, this 109% on. What we're doing is we're having this. Top is negative. 40. But I can change this. I can say Trump is gonna be negative. 20 left is gonna be negative. 20",33854.63,12.23
as well as let's create a see you next. Little bit smaller. So this is should be sitting all the way in the back. Then we're gonna be having this image. Were not image basically block with background,33867.09,11.28
"gray on. Then we having our image. Okay, so this probably would be a little bit more interesting example where we can start using again the pseudo elements before and after",33878.37,11.55
. Probably again. Not the biggest example that you could see in the world. Meaning you can use all kinds of other things with sue development. But at least this would give,33890.54,19.89
"you, like a little taste where it would be much more interesting than just displaying the block. Now we can add the block quotes. I mean again, there's tons of interesting things we can do. This is just, I think, in my",33910.43,2.24
"opinion, more interesting that when we didn't before and you don't have to do this along with me because we haven't covered a few of these properties. But just to show you how this was gonna interact with the page",33912.67,11.44
", I'm gonna add some things we haven't covered yet. Again. You don't have to do them. I'm gonna leave them in your code so you can maybe actually explore them later on. But don't worry about",33924.54,10.75
"it again. We haven't covered them. But what I would like to do right now is as I'm hovering, I would want these guys to move. So how this is gonna work? Well, first of all, I'm gonna head over here again. We're gonna",33935.29,11.14
"cover. We're going to write something we haven't done yet, so I'm gonna say, as I'm hovering to Div, I would want before enough there to actually move something to say. After that, I'm going to copy and paste it on",33946.43,12.66
". One thing we have covered. Oh, even though we don't know understand the selectors yet we have covered that we can actually group them together. Right? So I can say before and after",33959.09,11.31
". So both of them are gonna be selected and what I would want. Well, I would want top of them and the zero left of them to be zero on. Yeah, that's gonna be it. So let me say this. Okay",33970.41,12.08
", So what happens? So as I'm hovering, this is actually getting headed. No. We can also add a little bit of transition and again, please don't worry about the properties in the values. We will gonna cover them. As",33982.71,12.17
"also, don't worry about this selector. This is gonna be covered in few videos. But what I can do here is Aiken, say transition. I'm gonna do all 0.5 pixels on",33994.89,13.24
". We're gonna write linear on along with me. Copy and paste this line of code. We're gonna head over here. Copy and paste it to on Check this out. So as I'm hovering now, this is happening over 0.5",34008.13,21.04
"seconds. Much more cooler example than what we looked at a simple block on simple text here on the top on In general terms, this is how you would use the before",34029.17,2.59
and after elements. Just remember again you need to use the content you are not gonna be successful using with an image. And you're placing this before and after the actual content,34031.76,11.36
"off the element, not before and after the element. Hey, guys, before we deep down into CSS transitions, transformations and animations Elect, take a quick",34043.25,11.07
"pit stop and revisit selectors in CSS Some of you might be wondering Well, why are we just taking a quick pit stop and not full on to our stop? Well, here's the thing. Yes",34054.33,12.26
", there are many more selectors in CSS. I am fully aware of that. But here's my argument. You want to use CSS to make cool stuff right? Websites, applications, and so on",34066.6,11.33
"and so forth on to tell me honestly, weaken easily do all those things just by using simple selectors. So I think it is much more productive that we cover Onley Basic selectors start",34077.93,12.14
creating awesome stuff and then if we need to get something very specific done and we need a very specific CSS selected for that. We can always go back and learn that selector. So in this module,34090.07,11.29
"we were fresh on selector basics as well. Let's cover some other essential CSS electors. All right, why don't we start with the basics that we already have covered all throughout",34101.36,10.79
the scores? But it's kind of important starting point. So let's say within the HTML were going to say there's gonna be hitting and I'm gonna purposely name them exactly the same just so we can kind,34112.15,11.46
"of see the difference. So I'm going to say there's going to be heading one with the 90 of heading and I'm gonna call this. I am Ah, I d heading so extremely simple. And we're gonna copy and paste",34123.61,12.27
this line on. We're gonna write that not there's gonna be heading with an I. D. There's gonna be instead off glass and here we can just write a class heading again just so we can see that there's obviously,34135.88,12.55
"gonna be different with selections. And you know what? Last but not least, let's add a little tiny paragraph with a hello world in it. So far, so good. No, What's happening in the CSS",34148.43,12.3
". We already know what basic selectors we can use. So let's say fired once. So like them all, I could just say selection of all on we're gonna be looking for the color red. All of them are going to be with",34160.73,11.43
a color it We can also select the I d on dykan say 40 I d. I would want what first of all I would need to have the hashtag. Then I would need the name of the I d And then let's add maybe different,34172.17,12.15
"answers. 40 pixels is gonna be good enough. Then we have text transform property also, So let's transform it to upper case. So this is gonna be my application, dude on",34184.35,12.42
. You know what? Let's change the color. So here we would like to change that Call it on. We already know that there is going to be specificity. So even though we selected all the elements on added color,34196.78,11.21
"red, since this is more specific, we are overriding the property value that we had with a less specific selector. Now we can also use the class and again this would be the difference",34207.99,11.66

"far, so good. Very simple. Now, if this is annoying or can just comment this out, maybe some of you hate the red color, especially since it's for the whole background. But what is more interesting on what it would",35190.11,11.46
"be? The case is apart from CSS variables that we haven't covered. But we were gonna cover later and again, I'm will going to revisit the route because this we're gonna be setting up the variables. But where else",35201.57,10.95
"we can use the route? No, we can use it for general styles. So let's say that I would have a heading one, and the font size is here. I don't know. Could be anything as long as you're using the rgm",35212.52,12.1

"again. Most of them are gonna be exactly the same. And now let's look at the root element. So what's happening is if we're gonna be styling something relative, the route, we can go back to the root and we can",35366.17,12.04
"change these settings. So let's say in this case, I was styling everything towards the route. So my heading one was three rd ems and obviously most likely you're gonna have your paragraphs that",35378.21,11.44

"increasing the value here by these 50% but this was a relative to the actual route. So everything that we're gonna change within this property in the root, what we're gonna have",35412.67,11.3
"is the response of values. But again, the hap salud one didn't change because absolute was just 24 pixels and I'm good to go. The relative one is the one that you can",35423.98,11.22

"the left direction, however positive is going to move the right direction. So far, so good. No. We also have an option off 50% or I'm sorry percent, but we were gonna use 50%. Now",35720.91,11.9
", how is that gonna look like one? Let's say we're gonna move it 50%. And obviously, since the value was positive again, we moved the right direction. Here's the kicker dough. 50% means 50%",35732.81,13.88
"off this. 150 pixels. Don't believe me. Well, let's look at the third one which was blue on. You saw that initially there Exactly in the same position. Now, if you didn't notice that",35746.7,11.86
", then I could just come in this out and you can see that their city exactly where the other one was. Okay, what if I go over here and I do the same thing where I use the transform just",35758.56,11.77
only with the pixels. So what happens is I can just say not 50% but let's say 75 pixels on you can see that 75 pixels would be exactly the half from,35770.33,11.99
"150. So that tells me that this 50% is going to reflect on the actual with off the L. So if I'm gonna change it here, let's say 309",35782.32,11.84
"pixels then are so this is gonna move way more. Well, maybe this was a little bit too drastic example. It's maybe go with 109 on. Then we can see that this is not gonna work exactly the same because",35794.16,12.14
they're not gonna be in one line. But I hope you understood the idea where If I'm moving this to the right by 50% that is gonna mean exactly half off its with. And I can double,35806.3,12.46
"check that by moving the third guy. Exactly 75 pixels. And they were gonna match. Well, if we're looking at it, we see that there's gonna be translate X. Can we do translate wife? Well, I think",35818.76,12.12
"we can figure it out. So we have transform than four transformations weaken Do instead of X We're gonna do Why on here again, let's just it out first Black pixels. So if we're gonna say 30",35830.88,11.89
"pixels, man right away, let's do the negative. Now My box moved up because I went into negative direction. So if I'm gonna get rid of the negative one now, I see it went down",35842.77,12.48
"because we're moving the positive direction again. Very straightforward. You want to move it up? This is gonna have to be negative. You want to move it down, then this is gonna have to be positive. We also have an",35855.25,11.83
"option off, actually combining them both. So let me come in this out. Let me start a new one again. Transformed, translate. And then if I'm not adding extra. Why now? The first",35867.08,12.01
value is gonna be X X is and the second one is gonna be y axis again and list amount of possibilities on. I don't think that there is a point to covering them just to show you how this is gonna work. So,35879.09,11.76
let's say I would like to move this 20 pixels on the X direction and then in a 30 pixels in the Y direction. So what happens is that the box moved 20 pixels to the right,35890.85,11.5
"and then 30 pixels now, because we moved it obviously in the Y direction. If we want to move it, let's say a little bit more could do 209 pixels by 309 pixels. And then now the box",35902.73,12.04
"is gonna move 209 pixels, the right and then 309 pixels down again. We can use the percentages here. We can use the negative values on. I'll let you explore in more detail if you would like",35914.77,11.19
to. But generally this is how we could work. We transform and translate function within the CSS next one up. We have the scale and you'll notice the a lot of things,35925.96,11.77
"that we already have a translate here is gonna be very relatable to the scale. Know what? Start maybe with the red one on, Let's use transform. And then we're gonna set it equal not to translate",35937.73,11.41
", but we're gonna use the scale. No scale again is gonna have few options. We can have these k lex, and we have scale. Why as well as we have scale so that we can enter both",35949.52,11.37
"values for the X one on the white one. Now with the X was gonna happen is that if we're going to go past the value of one in the X direction, the element is gonna grow the X direction",35960.89,11.62
". So let's say if I'm going to say to, then the element is going to get twice as big in the X direction notice it happens on the right hand side on on the left inside. However, if I'm gonna go less",35972.59,11.3
"than one, so let's say 0.1 now the element is going to be half the size, but the trimming is gonna happen on both sides. So not only let's say on one side, but the trimming",35983.89,11.68
"is gonna happen on the left hand side on the right hand side. So, no, this is gonna be half the size off the previous element. That would be the X direction. Obviously, we can do the same thing in the Y direction. Let me just",35995.57,12.07
"copy this on. Let's say for the number two number green one instead of next, we're gonna place why I noticed what happens. So now the element is gonna be half the size in",36007.64,11.47
"the Y direction. You want it twice as big. And again, I'm just using the round values. You can do something like this. So obviously this is just going to grow a little bit more than the normal one. But I'm just using",36019.11,11.18
"to just so he conceded for sure on the element is growing. Okay, so that would be the wife. Direction on self explanatory. We can use both values. So if I'm going to use the same thing here, and if I'm gonna copy",36030.29,11.75
"the transformation, I would say we're gonna have new one. Then this is gonna be scale, and I would like to I don't know, zoom it or I'm sorry that zoom it, make it smaller eggs direction. And why",36042.51,11.53
"direction This is the only thing we need to do. So now what happens is that this element is half the size X direction, as was my direction we wanted make it bigger, could make it 1.5",36054.04,13.32
"as well is here and now. Obviously, the element is gonna be bigger next direction. Why direction? Very, very straightforward. If you ever need to increase the size of the element X",36067.37,11.74
"or Y direction, you can just use scale. After that, we have the rotate, and I have to be right away, straight up honest with you, that with rotations, the X and Y directions are going",36079.12,10.99
"to be hard to see, especially as I'm showing this in the example. Now, what's gonna be easier to see is going to be rotate Z on. We're also gonna look at the shortcut. And that's the reason why I'm going to start",36090.11,11.74
"right away with our rotations, E because I think you're gonna be using that more often than just X and one now, how disease gonna work, right? And let's a first we're gonna be looking for information",36101.85,11.52
"on. We're working here with the second one, I believe right, that was the green one and then we have rotate and they were looking for to see now the way this is gonna work. If we were going to write some kind of degrees",36113.69,11.66
"once a 45 degrees, this is gonna be the easiest one to see because this is gonna be rotated right now on the Z axis. Very swift world. Very simple. So if I'm going to say 109 80",36125.76,11.27
"now, this is obviously gonna move under Navy on this. I was gonna be exactly the same like we had before, but let's say if we would wanna I don't know, go with 135",36137.39,12.33
". Then again, this is gonna look exactly like the 45. You get an idea, we have 360 degrees, and then we can rotate de Helaman. However, we would like now how this is gonna go",36150.1,11.34
"with ex acts as an y axis, so here will have a transform our you know what? Before we actually cover the X and Y axes, you also want to say that this is gonna be exactly the same. So",36161.44,12.41
"if we're going, let's say copy and paste it the red one on change it around to. I don't know, 340 were going to get some kind of rotation because this would be the shorthand",36173.86,11.85
". So we don't have to times e We can just say, OK, rotate on both of them would mean exactly the same thing. Uh, yeah, that is just gonna be side note. Hopefully you've got that. And then last but not",36185.98,11.47
"least, we're gonna be looking at both of them the x and Y on here. I would one transform that I'm looking for. Like I said already. Rotation on for rotation. I'm looking for",36197.45,11.52
"the X value on this case. You from going a little, let's say 20 degrees. Like I said, this is gonna be hard to see because what I'm doing as I'm rotating this X direction or",36208.97,12.12
"if I'm telling you that this is gonna be 90 degrees, we're not gonna be able to see that, because if we're looking at the X Plain Lang right now, we have rotated this exactly nine degrees",36221.1,11.54
"and this is gonna be hard to see now. We can also do the same thing. Let's say here, comment this out on we're going to do the Y direction. So it's do transform andan",36232.98,12.4
"rotate. Why direction again? This is gonna work exactly the same where, Let's say 20 degrees is gonna rotate it. So this is gonna be a little bit small on this moment already. Wide direction",36245.38,11.76
"because previously, remember, it got smaller in the X axis because we're flipping it around the exact Now we're flipping it around the y axis. This is the reason why 20 degrees is gonna make this smaller",36257.48,11.73
"here. Not from gonna go 40 degrees. This is gonna get even smaller. 60 degrees is going to something like this, even smaller. And then finally, again, If I want to flip it around, Aiken",36269.21,11.65
"do 90 degrees. And then my actually element is going totally disappear right now because we have rotated this 90 degrees. Since it is not our first rodeo, we're",36280.86,11.24
"recon. Guess off what the skew is going to do. Um, the fact that scares gonna have again the X direction in the Y direction as well as we can combine them both. So",36292.1,11.32
"I guess we're gonna do with simple one with number one on here. I would like to get to work with transform and on the right that I ask, you will get a first look at the X direction on",36303.43,11.7
"here again. We're gonna have to write degrees. So if we're gonna say 20 degrees, this is gonna screw it this way. It can also have the negative value on this is going to skew the other direction. No",36315.13,11.53
", with me, copy and paste this. And let's say that I would like to have the skew wife or the second one on. Now, obviously, this is gonna be the Y plane that's being skewed. No, last",36326.66,12.08
"but not least, you already guessed that that we can do the both of them on Let's say here that we're gonna be looking for number three and that's not what I wanted to do. I didn't want assure you the bigger screen doesn't really matter",36338.74,10.87
". We can see everything here in a smaller one on. Let's say if I'm gonna go negative 20 degrees or you know what, let's do 40 degrees and let you show you that if I'm not gonna add on, but then one",36350.09,19.83
"lead it If I'm not gonna add any kind of value in the Y direction, what happens is that this is going on. The only skew the extraction don't believe me. How? I can do the same thing here and now. As",36369.92,3.3
"you can see, both of them are exactly the same. How are if we're gonna have the second value here with degrees? This is also going to spin in the wind direction. So what's to start out with 20 degrees",36373.22,11.49
"on here? If they could have a look, then we see that this is gonna skewed both directions. The why direction has. Well, Azad direction has, um once we have the general idea",36384.72,11.7
"about the transformed property, we're gonna shift our attention to transition on. If in one sentence, I would need to answer you what is transition? That would be change happening",36396.42,12.08
"over some period of time and again, the example is gonna explain it much more better. But if I would have to give you once and the example, that would be a change over time. Now you'll notice also",36408.54,21.07
"that transition property is gonna be a lot similar, like we had with background, because this is gonna have quite a few of them on. Eventually we're gonna look at a shorthand on the set up",36429.61,2.14
is gonna be exactly the same. We're gonna have three dibs on. Let's figure out one problem. Let's say that I have three Dave's. We already know how to use the hover pseudo selector on,36431.75,13.32
"As I'm hovering over those, there's I would like to change the color. So for now I have red, green and blue. But let's say for all the Dave's as I'm hovering and again, we would need to use the pseudo selector we would like",36445.08,11.29
"to change the background color on. Let's say background color is gonna be whatever you would like to be. In my case, I'm gonna go with Quarrel. So far, so good as I'm hovering more than lives, the color is",36456.37,11.3
"changing. How are you probably noticing that the colors changing instantly on while that might work. In some cases, you probably would want to happen exchange over",36467.67,11.86
"some period of time because I think it's gonna look smoother now. How do we do? First of all, let's just work. We have number three because I would still want you to see the other two where change is gonna happen instantly and let's",36479.53,12.15
"say for number three first we will need to start working with transition now for transition with first would need to say what kind of property? Well, is it this gonna be? I don't know. The font size is just",36491.68,11.41
"gonna be with or whatever. Well, in my case, I'm gonna say that transition property is going to be the background. So here, I'm gonna write Bank run. Okay. So far, so good. Okay, once we saved what happens, well, nothing",36503.09,12.77
"happens. We're still having this change instantly, because the second thing we will need to add is transition on. Then we're gonna be looking forward. Duration. So how long this transition",36515.86,11.5
"is going to take place? We can use the seconds we can use milliseconds. Normally, we're gonna settle for something like 0.3. But just because I would want you to see how this is happening, I'm gonna go",36527.36,11.28
"with quite big number, and this is gonna be four seconds. So as I'm hovering over what happens well, the color is changing. However, the colors changing over a period of",36538.64,11.28
"four seconds, not instantly liked with the rest of them. And this is something that we can deal with a transition property. Luckily, for us as we were working with transition probably were not limited to",36549.92,11.27
"only one property. So what if let's say for number three, the one that actually has a transition, I would like to add another thing and other property. We have a hover. Well, we have few options",36561.19,11.33
". I can either add this property here for all of them. Since here, I'm just selecting all the dips more. We can be more precise than I can say. You know what? As I'm hovering over the three, I would like to change it on border",36572.52,11.15
"radius on. In this case, I would need to have my suit of selector. So I'm going to say, as them hovering over three, I would like to have border radius on. Let's say this is gonna be 50%. And again",36583.67,11.61
", I would just like to pay attention to the fact that I could have added this to all of them. It's going to do exactly the same thing. The difference would be that this is gonna be applied to all the lives in this case, since",36595.29,11.6
"this is the only one we're using the transition property. That's the reason why I'm adding it specifically to hover off three. So as I'm hovering, What happened? What I see is that my",36606.95,10.79
"border, it is changes instantly, and the color is taking four seconds. Because for now, only thing would having his transition property on the name was background. So the way we're gonna do this is",36617.74,12.12
"we're gonna have a comma that will be this in text. And then we just need to again, right the property name. Now, our guys, this is gonna be border radius on. We also have an option off. Let's say what kind of duration",36629.86,11.77
"is gonna be for the second property. If we don't want it to be four seconds, we just need to again another their value in our case, we're gonna leave it for now. The same. So this would be four seconds on. This is gonna happen",36641.63,11.67
"the same way where the color is gonna take four seconds as well as the Borys. However he if working out here, I don't know. Two seconds. Then the radius is gonna happen in",36653.3,12.37
"two seconds and you can see still, that color is changing. So that would be the way how we can have multiple properties With our transition property stunning, we officially know the basics",36665.67,11.8
"and general idea behind transition. Why don't we take a look at the transition, the late property as well as how we can write a shorthand? Because otherwise you might find it annoying. If you're gonna have 50",36677.47,11.08
"properties, if you're gonna have to have to specifically name all of them in your position property. No, first and foremost, let's go with delay. Since I think this is gonna be asked trade forward as it",36688.55,10.76
"gets. So again, we're gonna write transition. So saying transition, where are you delay on, then we're saying for some kind of dealing. Well, I don't know how long you would like to wait. Do you want me",36699.31,12.25
"to talk for nothing for 10 seconds or let's say three seconds. Now, the moment we're gonna have this, what's gonna happen is that this is gonna take three seconds. So this would happen over three seconds. And",36711.56,11.6
"now only then the changes are going to take place. Now, as I'm hovering, I'm gonna wait, Wait, wait, wait, wait. And then after three seconds, my transition takes place again. Nothing really. To add as",36723.16,11.89
"straightforward as it gets. This is just going to delay your transition. So far, so good. Well, what about like I said, if this gets really annoying, if you have multiple properties that you would like to change over",36735.05,11.53
"here, do you think this is gonna be the best syntax where we just need to add the property? The duration delay on this is where the image comes into play. Meaning? Remember when we were covering the background",36746.58,11.47
"image? Eventually we came up with really neat and nifty syntax where we just wrote all our values so we can do something very similarly over here. First of all, let me delete this. Say that we're",36758.05,12.13
gonna get rid of this. Then I also would like to probably get rid of this cover because otherwise this might be a little bit confusing to you. And let's say that we only gonna be working with our third year. Let's just leave the other two or,36770.18,20.45
"more on. We're gonna copy and paste it, and we're going to say that we're gonna be changing to things as were hovering border, radius and background. But what I would like to understand that we can add anything over here. As long as we're",36790.63,3.2
"following the proper Syntex Now, the properties intact would be like this. We're gonna first have the transition. Then we're gonna have to write the name off the transition. So let's say in our case or",36793.83,11.77
"I'm sorry, the name of the property, we're gonna write background so that that's gonna be our first thing, and then we're gonna be looking for how the transition is gonna take place. So how long the transition",36805.6,12.32
"duration? In our case, we're going to say, Well, this is gonna be three seconds and then we have an option of adding, if you would want to have some kind of dealing. So in my case, let's say I'm gonna be looking for five seconds",36817.92,11.5
"now the moment we're gonna save it. First of all, please understand that this is gonna be option. What you're really, really for sure need is gonna be in this three seconds. You know, I just to make it actually a little bit more understanding",36829.85,20.27
". I'm gonna right away at it. And then what happens is that the background is gonna change place in three seconds. No, I'm still having my border radio, so maybe let me come in the South because this might be a little bit confusing",36850.12,3.0
". So the background is gonna take change in three seconds again. Something really similar we already covered. But this would be the shorthand s. So far, so good. Then we have an optional one",36853.31,12.27
"on that is going to be how the transition is gonna take place. But we're gonna cover it at the next video. So for now, I'm just gonna leave this blank. But we also have an optional off delay. So let's say in",36865.71,11.27
"this case I'm riding the delay and that I'm saying that DeLay is gonna take two seconds. Now first, as I'm hovering, we're gonna wait for two seconds, and then the background is gonna be changing over the",36876.98,11.53
"period of three seconds. So far, so good. What else? Well, if I would want the border radius, I could do the same thing. That's a border. And I have the same properties here. You want to write the same ones",36888.51,20.87
", you can write the same ones war, weaken. Say, I don't know, the border radius is gonna take place over five seconds as well as the delay is going to be on one second. Something like this. It doesn't really matter",36909.38,1.83
". As long as you make sure that these properties are correct. None with me And common this Now we're gonna wait for two seconds for the background to change, and then after one second, I'm gonna have my border radius",36911.48,11.48
", which is gonna take five seconds again, something we already have covered What's really nifty, though? If we would like to have the same duration, the same delay and all",36923.11,11.17
"that we can write even bigger. Shorter where we just write like this we're gonna say, first of all the properties on this is a syntax, so don't write it your own. This needs to be in this ward fall",36934.28,11.82
". Then we're saying how the transition duration is gonna look like and in our case, I don't know. We can say for just change again. This is gonna be four seconds on DeLay is gonna be, I don't know, five seconds again",36946.47,11.98
". This is gonna be optional, So you might not at it, You might add, It doesn't really matter on that. I'm gonna first all wait for this Dave to appear because that's gonna be the thing when this pretty much",36958.45,10.99
". This transition right now is taking place. Now, the moment this Dave is gonna appear, notice what's gonna happen. So as I'm hovering now, we're gonna wait for five seconds. So we're waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting",36969.57,11.02
". And the moment off. Five seconds are up. Then both things are happening. The border radius, as well as the background on both of them. Take change over four seconds of time. Now, this is",36981.03,11.46
how we can work with delays as well as this is how we can work with the actual short hand for the transition property. We're almost done with transition property. But in the last video,36992.49,11.87
", I mentioned the optional transition timing property. So why don't we take a closer look? First and foremost, I want to tell you that there's a lot to this particular property, and the reason why",37004.36,11.85
"we were going to cover a bare minimum is the simple fact that at this point in time, in my opinion, that would be an oracle to spend more time on it. The general idea behind the property",37016.21,11.55
"is specifically decide how the transition is gonna take place. Um, just let you know that there is a default value Already off, he's on. That is the reason why the property",37027.82,12.07
"is optional. Now what other values we're gonna have? Well, first and foremost, if you're looking at the shorthand, you see that the transition timing function is gonna be placed here. So first we're gonna",37039.9,12.09
have the property that's gonna be affected. That ain't gonna look how long the transition is gonna take place. And then we have the transition timing function. Now we can write it separately on during,37051.99,12.11
"the example, gonna look in both ways, but the right away just let you know that in the short hand, this is gonna be placed here. Like I said, the ease value is gonna be default. That's the reason why it's option. And",37064.1,12.64
"as we're looking at these values, these one would be slow start. Then this is gonna go fast on the slow end. Then we also have the linear. So that would be the same speed as well as we're looking",37076.74,11.65
"at easing and he's out so slow. Start and slew in and then last But not least, we would have the ease into No, no. Like I said, this is just gonna make a little bit more sense as we're looking",37088.39,11.32
"with an example. And you know what? I will gonna de redo the actual indexation email. So first of all, let me get rid of these deer's as well as we're gonna clean up a little bit of CSS because I would like",37099.71,11.87
"to restructure it a little bit on Let's say within the indexation email, I would like to start by creating a DIV. Then the deal is obviously gonna have a class. Now, the default class is",37111.58,11.79
"gonna be the first one I'm going to say Default and let's right, maybe also the text or here then I would like to create another one, and in general, we're gonna create six of them. Now, I know this might be a little bit unwilling",37123.37,12.31
", but since I would like to show you how they would work, was gonna have to go along with it, and we're gonna copy and paste it. Then we're looking at linear. So the New York timing function also, we",37135.68,12.49

"on. Let me get out of this guy as well as you know, at least is also a Norco. So for some reason, I decided that I'm gonna be adding way too many examples that I would want Knock it. Now that we have the",37173.72,12.31

"dips? So I'm gonna say, for all the deaths, it's gonna be exactly the same. We're gonna have the with off, I don't know, 109 pixels. The height is also gonna be 109 pixels, so that's right",37197.47,13.62
. Height is gonna be 109 pixels. Then we also have an option off background. So let's right the background blue. Now all of them are gonna look something like this. We can also add the color just so we can see,37211.09,11.84
"the text a little bit better. So the text right now is white. Ah, you know what? We also can use a little bit of marginal around, so it's a margin is gonna be 15 pixels on. Now we're having the margin",37222.93,11.69

"don't know. Let's do Dave hover. So as we're having to give, let's combine whatever we already learned about the transform. So why don't we write transform? So we're gonna be transforming on",37246.96,11.83
"the way we're gonna transform it. We're going to translate it. My let's say 109 pixels. Like I said, by default right away you will gonna be having this ease. So if I would have right here, over here, ease",37258.79,11.27
", that would be the default value anyway. So, technically, you wouldn't have to write this Now if I would want for all of them linear, just type linear, and then what's gonna happen is the transition. He is",37270.35,12.56
"gonna have the same speed all throughout this transition. So it's going to start the same way in the same way and during position is also going to perform the same way. Ah, just to let you know again, we have",37282.91,11.39

like this so I could have wrote it transition then all than whatever two seconds. Any on again. This is just to show you that these are possible options since we have,37332.11,12.27
"already set up to Div here with transition of all on one second, I'm just adding here This timing function, but in general normally would write something like this where would specifically go",37344.38,11.46
"with each and every transition. Now, I don't want to do each and every transition for all of them because we have six of them. So that is the reason why I'm using the shortcut where I already set up everything in a div. So",37355.84,12.06
"the properties, all of them, the timing is gonna be one second. And then for each and every day, If will's gonna look a different property value forests, timing, function, that's",37367.9,21.21
"all we're doing. Um, as you notice, this shouldn't be no difference. So the first one is gonna be exactly the same as the second. It was like I said, the default while value is gonna be he's. So if I set up these, this",37389.11,2.78
is gonna look exactly the same. Now with our valley's we're gonna have let's say we can look at linear on for the linear. Then we can just copy and paste this on. Let's just change this still in here,37391.89,11.83
. That's a Lini here on the moment was gonna happen. Notice that there's not gonna be this slow start or slow it. This is gonna take exactly the same speed has throughout,37404.4,11.64

"name it. He's and And I know this might be a little bit annoying, but again, since I would like to show you at least the general idea behind it, there's gonna be a little bit of typing and then we're gonna be looking for",37455.41,11.7

"to 109. Always. We went from some kind of state that was here, Let's say on left inside. And then our box moved to right inside, and then it moved back. What school? With innovation",37586.3,11.9

"on that, that that whatever percentages would want, I I know or you know already what I'm gonna say is that we're gonna have to look at the example because there's always this is just gonna make way",37610.05,20.02
"more sense. And again, yes, we will gonna be deleting CSS. We will gonna be dilating html because I do find it much more convenient or much more productive. If we get",37630.07,3.02
"used to working with HTML and CSS, we could always lets a expand on the previous example, but that I think Rob's you the actual opportunity to work on the muscle",37633.09,10.37

"class on the class. Let's say is gonna be transition just so we can see the difference, Onda, we can also maybe right, transition name here. Maybe that's gonna make sense. And then I would like to copy and paste it. And",37654.9,12.17
now I would like to actually delete these values. I'm going to say that I'm gonna get rid of the transition on here. We're gonna write animation and you already probably guested that we're gonna be styling,37667.07,12.03
"one with transition on the second one with animation now within the CSS. Let's just say that both there's are gonna look exactly the same. So again with is gonna be on time, 209",37679.1,11.54

"And you know what I said? This is not gonna be class. This is gonna be the day. And then let's start with specific classes. So for transition, I'm gonna say, And you know what last been leased may have color",37702.74,12.77
"on Dwight here on four. Transition What I would want for this day. First of all, let's answer my ground. Let's say background is gonna be right. So this is gonna be my transition on. Also, I would like to say that there",37716.27,12.89
"is going to be some kind of change, So I'm gonna do this. We transition. I'm going to say there's gonna be transition now. All the properties are going to be affected. This is gonna take two seconds on. Let's do linear. Since",37729.16,20.6
we know that ease is gonna be the default one anyway. No. Great. So far so good as well as I would like to work with my hovering because obviously this transition should take place as,37749.76,2.87
"I'm hovering. So I'm going to say as we transition as we're hovering, what should happen? Well, let's say background is gonna turn yellow, get nothing really original as well as I don't",37752.63,12.9
"know, well done out of work with a transformed property. So I'm gonna say transform is going to be again translating X direction by Let's say, I don't know, 109 pixels. So something",37765.53,11.9
"like this. No, what happens as I'm hovering, then this is gonna move all the way to the right. And then as we're not hovering, we're moving all the way to the left market. So far, so good. So what about the animation",37777.43,13.0
"when this is so special? Well, let's start working on this dip. So first of all, the name was animation and now let's add maybe a background off. I don't know Blue, something like this. So",37790.58,20.89
"this is gonna have the background on what else would like to add over here. Ah, we can start working with animation. Maybe right away. Now, 40 animations. We would need to set up key frames. So the syntax",37811.47,4.17
"would be something like this. We would need to, Right? First of all, hat on this is gonna be very similar. Like we worked with media queries, Remember, we did something very similar. We had the atom. That media? No. In this case",37815.64,11.49
", we're gonna have to ride the key frames. No, the naming matters here. Meaning if you're gonna name this Grandpa Bob, then you also need to reference it in the animation with same name. Don't",37827.13,11.75
"write something here different than within the animation, because this is not gonna work. This is a simple is that And I'm just gonna call my animation move on. Like I said, the difference would be that we're not",37838.88,11.78
"going from the state of 0 to 109. We have multiple states Now, how do we access the states? We can use the percentage values going to say 4 to 0%. This is gonna have some kind of value",37850.66,12.6
". And first of all, I'm just going to say, transform on. Let's translate it. I don't know, 20 pixels eggs direction. So I'm gonna say exit direction. 20 pixels. So this is gonna be my zero value. And then",37863.26,11.89
"also I can have an option here off saying at 50% this should be translated, let's say, 109 pixels. So again we can copy and paste it on. Let's say 109 pixel. Now. We're not",37875.15,11.77
"limited to only having the one property here because, as you can see, we're working just with Trans one. We also conduce, let's say background And again, this could be as many properties as you would",37886.92,10.73
"like. No, let me understand my colon. Otherwise, this is gonna throw an error on Let's a background is gonna be red. So that's 50% of the animation. The background is going to be read. Then we can add 75",37897.65,12.29
"on as always. The reason why I'm using these around values is just give you an idea. Please understand that you can use 1 to 3% 1.5. It doesn't really matter, but",37910.18,20.12
"I'm not obviously going to cover all of them because it doesn't really make sense if we're gonna be going from 0 to 109 bite each and every information Ah, you know what we can in this case maybe grab these",37930.77,2.16
"values already. So going to say translate on in this case, I would want to move with 109% negative. So this is going to shift and left. The yellow color is gonna be also the color for",37932.93,11.72
"the background. And last but not least, let's go 409. Where on you know what? They're gonna copying faces way too many times on 409. I don't know what I would want and let me decide. I'm gonna go back again",37944.65,12.75
"to 20 pixels. I guess as well as I'm gonna set this up with Green. So that's my animation. Now, at the moment, as I'm refreshing the page, nothing happens. And the reason why nothing happens because we still need",37957.41,12.12
"to set up the animation now for the animation again. Similarly, how we Hadley transition. We have the long way of writing this or we have the shorthand. So first, maybe let's start with",37969.54,20.42
"the long one, and then we're gonna bounce back to a shorthand version, Not for the animation we're gonna say first little animation name. So we always always need the animation name. And this is where the name incomes",37989.96,2.55
"important again. If you name this something else Don't, Right, Grandpa Maria Here. We're not Grandpa Mondrian. Grandma Maria on. Let's say here, I'm gonna write. Move. Since this is",37992.51,11.42
"obviously the name of my animation know, once we say that nothing happens because there's two more properties that we need for the animation. So not only we need direction so similarly like",38003.93,10.92
we had with transformation or transition. I'm sorry. Then we also need the count. So how many times this animation is gonna take place? So we're gonna be looking for animation,38014.85,11.82
"on. Then we have the count properly. Animation it oration, count, animation it aeration. And then we're looking for account. We have all kinds of options. We can go one Teoh",38027.09,12.18
", whatever. 12. And we're also gonna have infinite value. Now, we're gonna look at the infinite value later on. Let me just go with two. So this is gonna run two times. No notice what happens on right now. This",38039.28,12.45
"animation is right now bouncing to 50% and then 75 was negative 209 then we're going back again to a zero. And again, the animation is gonna take",38051.74,11.35
"two times because we have the count here of to you now, you can already see that this gives you way more options. Transition was very simple. I go from one side and I go to another side on",38063.27,11.99
"devalues their changing from 0% 209% with the animation. This gives you unlimited amount of options. Now, keep in mind, though, this 10 seconds is going to reflect this 50%",38075.26,13.16
". So if I'm gonna right here, let's say 20 seconds than my 50% is gonna be already a 10 seconds on So on and so forth. So these values air correlating to each other. So if we're gonna write one second, this",38088.66,11.05
"50% is gonna mean 0.5 seconds on so on and so forth. Okay, so far, so good. Now, what about the shorter? Because we see, obviously the long way of writing. Now for the short gun again",38099.72,11.98
", this is gonna be very, very similar to what we had with transitions. First is gonna be the name. And you know what? Let me go up here and so like the mall and just come in their mouth. Their first one is gonna be name",38111.7,11.65
". Then again, we were looking for how long this is gonna take place or duration. And maybe in this case, let's write five seconds as well as the last one is gonna be how many times we're going to run their animation and",38123.54,12.04
"let's use the infinite value, because that way you'll see that the animation is gonna be bouncing infinitely on whatever again we have. The 50% 75 on the animation is",38135.58,11.18
"just gonna keep on repeating because we set up this value we the infinite bones on this is how we can work with an emissions in the CSS. Well, we're still on a topic of animation. Why",38146.76,12.21
"don't we take a look at the animation film on property on what it stands for now, the theory is that animation feel mode is helpful with defining the values outside",38158.97,12.12
"the animation. Now, in practical, how this is gonna look like, Well, I don't know, maybe an index html Let's get her of this transition. We don't need it as well as let's make our assess",38171.09,11.64
"a little bit more slim. We're not gonna have these styles for transitions, cause we already have covered it. And you know what? Also, I would like to get her off all these comments here. And you know what? Might as well let's",38182.73,11.71
"get out of the animation. For now, at least on delete all the information that we have within the move animation to begin with, just I would like to start from the scratch. So I have my animation",38194.44,12.2
"And you know what? The moment I say with obviously this is gonna be my dear. Let's imagine some kind of scenario where there's going to be information and I would want to start with opacity off zero, which would",38206.64,11.76
mean that we wouldn't be able to see it is live on. We're going to do the animation where it goes back to 0.5 capacity. So then we would want to decide how the animation film mode is,38218.4,11.89
"gonna come into play. First things first, let's set up our information, and I'm going to say that at 0% there is gonna be the opacity off zero, right? Opacity zero. Then",38230.29,13.96
"also, there's gonna be 50% animation so at or you know what, That's maybe right. 25%. At 25 we would like to transform property again, and there's gonna be translate",38244.25,12.26
"X negative 209 or not. 209 Not to do 209. This is going to shift in the right as well as let's add a little bit more capacity. No, in this case, capacity is gonna be I",38256.52,12.39
"don't know, zero point. Ah, 25. Since this is 25% then let's copy. Invest it. Let's say 12 we have 50%. Yeah, that should be enough",38268.91,21.02
". So with 50% we're gonna have the capacity of 0.5, then at 109% we're also gonna have a opacity off. Let's say",38290.52,3.9
"you know what? No, let's change around. Let's say 50% is gonna be a passage of one. And then once we go back, 209% moving all half a capacity off 0.5, we already",38294.61,12.26
"know how we can use the animation. Someone right. Animation on the name is gonna be what? Well, the name was moved so that I would be in first value. Then we're looking for how long",38306.87,11.57
"the duration would be. So let's say five seconds and let's run this two times. No, the moment we save it, her innovation is kicking in. Everything is working Fine. But what happens? Well, we",38318.44,13.01
"get to the 15%. So this is where we're gonna stop then on here. Obviously there's a mistake. So yeah, I'm looking at I'm thinking what? This is doing that because housely left the translate",38331.45,11.76
"with 209. So let me fix this. I would want to have not 209. So my bad. I was waiting, waiting for it, and I'm like, looking at it. Well, wait a minute. Nothing is really happening on. Then let's a",38343.21,11.84
"zero. So this is gonna bounce to the right, then left back and then end up with zero. So in the moment we saved. Now we have our animation. When it balances, first time bounces the second",38355.05,11.47
"time, and then the end of the second time, it stays back to a opacity off one because we can clearly see where the actual Davis sitting for. And maybe that's",38366.52,12.29
not something we would want. Maybe I would want to end up with opacity of 0.4. So this is where the property off animation film mode comes into play where we can head over back here and we can say,38378.81,11.26
"animation, film mode and we have few options We have backwards where this would go back to original value, which in our case, would be something when this Where we have an option. If word now how",38390.07,20.74
"the forwards is gonna look like the moment I'm going to save it. Eventually. Once the animation is going to stop running, my Dave is going to stay with opacity of 0.4. Don't believe me. Let's test it out. The",38410.81,3.92
"animation runs the first time. Okay, so far, so good. Then again, we run the animation second time on the moment it stops running. Instead of going back to capacity one, which would",38414.73,11.43
"be original value, we are going forwards on staying with whatever values we had here. So if I'm gonna add, let's say translation of 20 pixels, what's gonna happen is my",38426.16,11.31
"Dave is gonna be by default right now. Also translated not only a passing and in general terms, this is how we can work with animation film where you would want your div. Let's",38437.47,11.74
"say Teoh, get the values that you end up with with 109% than yours gonna have animation film mode, and you're going to use the value of wards. Hey, guys, In our last module, before working",38449.21,20.6
"on a project, we will cover CSS variables. I want to use them. Why would want to use them in the first place? Held to add font, Awesome icons, tour projects And what would be the generals in tax",38469.81,2.69

"us a lot of flexibility. Now, the main point behind the variable would be the fact that we can store the variable and then we can reuse it whole. Throughout the document, not a syntax would be",38507.14,11.64
"dash dash than the name of the variable. And then what kind of value would like to hold on then, if you would like to use it, then we're gonna have the property. Andan against in tax would be far. So that",38518.78,11.54
"is this, in fact. So please don't give it and then he will need to go again with Dash Dash on the name of that variable. Now there is going to be two types of scopes for the variables. There is gonna be the global one where",38530.32,11.87
"we can use it all throughout the document. And now we're going to return back to this selector. Remember, we were talking about pseudo selectors, and in that case, we're talking about the route where we actually are selecting",38542.19,11.73
"the HTML element. So that way we're setting up our variables as global's where we can do it locally, just one element. Now, in our example again, we're going to use mostly",38553.92,11.05
"the actual colors or I think, maybe exclusively colors because they were gonna make most sense. But just remember, you can use it with any kind of property on throughout the projects. This is exactly what we're gonna do. First",38564.97,11.62
"things first, we're gonna head over back to HTML. As always, we need something to work with. So it's a heading, and in this case, I would like to have the class. So I'm going to say class on here. I'm going to use",38576.59,11.96
"the same heading class. Not technically. We maybe don't need to even add classes. We could have done this with heading ones, but, you know, just because I like adding classes. What was gonna go with, uh, classes? Okay, first one is",38588.55,11.69
"gonna be hitting one. Then we're gonna create another paragraph. I don't know. Here, the glass would be against text on. Let's, I don't know, have some Lauren text. I don't know. 20 words. I think that's gonna be enough",38600.24,11.45

", The reason for that is because I would like to show you how we can locally scope this. So I'm going to say first that there's gonna be Dave Then we didn't day. We're gonna have some class on the class. Name is going to be made",38623.8,10.92
