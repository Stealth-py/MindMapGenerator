madam Chief Justice and may it please,202.51,2.02
the court my name is max Kajal and on,204.53,2.61
behalf of petitioner Ian groves I will,207.14,1.86
address the First Amendment issue we,209.0,1.98
would like to reserve three minutes for,210.98,1.56
rebuttal,212.54,0.57
thank you two years ago mr. groves,213.11,3.0
created a digital design for a,216.11,1.65
single-shot plastic firearm following,217.76,2.82
instructions provided by groves that,220.57999999999998,1.74
design can be used to 3d print a set of,222.32,2.28
parts which can then be assembled into,224.6,2.13
the firearm although similar designs,226.73,2.19
have been accessible online for years,228.92000000000002,1.8
Ames is the only state in the nation to,230.72,2.13
have made it a felony to publish such,232.85,1.98
designs on the internet that law,234.82999999999998,2.25
violates the First Amendment for three,237.07999999999998,1.92
reasons first under this Court's,239.0,2.04
precedents in Bar Nicky and Free Speech,241.04,1.77
Coalition the law impermissibly targets,242.81,2.43
groves a speech to prevent third parties,245.24,2.13
criminal conduct second the law is,247.37,2.34
significantly over-inclusive because it,249.71,2.22
prevents grouse from sharing his design,251.93,1.65
with the many citizens of Ames who will,253.58,1.98
not put it to harmful uses third and,255.56,2.399
finally the law is a facially,257.959,1.651
content-based regulation of speech that,259.61,2.34
the state has not justified as actually,261.95,1.98
necessary to solve a current problem,263.93,2.19
counselor why should we our our,266.12,4.55
established precedent isn't this a new,270.67,4.21
form of technology your honor given that,274.88,3.57
it is shouldn't we be thinking about it,278.45,2.64
in a different way,281.09000000000003,1.23
your us is the first bit of technology,282.32,2.79
that I've ever seen that can direct,285.11,2.91
another machine to create an item that,288.02,4.17
could be put to dangerous use,292.19,1.94
Your Honor several points on that first,294.13,2.47
I think with respect this is an old kind,296.6,3.63
of speech it's a blueprint it's a design,300.23,2.27
foreign object the difference is that on,302.5,2.71
the user and a person now has access to,305.21,2.31
technology expensive technology that can,307.52,3.08
following the directions of giving it's,310.6,2.71
giving this technology can be used to,313.31,2.43
give a machine directions on how to,315.74,3.96
manufacture a dangerous item is very,319.7,4.92
different than any blueprint that we've,324.62,2.18
permitted in the past,326.8,1.839
those blueprints require an individual,328.639,4.321
to actually follow them assemble all of,332.96,2.94
the mechanisms necessary to put them,335.9,2.43
into effect it's one thing to build a,338.33,2.22
building you've got to get a lot of,340.55,2.07
things to build that building here all,342.62,2.19
you need is a 3d printer essentially,344.81,2.46
we're hundred I think you need the 3d,347.27,1.5
printer I think you also need the,348.77,1.32
appropriate raw materials you also need,350.09000000000003,2.189
a significant amount of technical,352.279,2.1
know-how to know how to operate it no,354.379,1.801
doubt it's easier than building a,356.18,1.139
building but we still submit there's,357.319,1.62
quite a bit of knowledge and expertise,358.939,2.19
that goes into the downloader side,361.129,1.38
before a person can take this this file,362.509,3.241
and turn it into a working firearm in,365.75,2.46
particular your honor it's our,368.21,1.199
submission as we say in our brief that,369.409,1.62
the kind of file is that our client,371.029,2.491
wants to upload to the internet actually,373.52,2.009
cannot direct a 3d printer to do,375.529,1.95
anything at all they need to be altered,377.479,1.771
on the downloader end as we say in our,379.25,2.43
opening brief sliced before they can,381.68,2.459
actually communicate to a 3d printer and,384.139,1.74
we think that makes that make some,385.879,1.59
difference these really are nothing more,387.469,1.62
than digital versions of blueprints or,389.089,2.67
of other descriptions visual or,391.759,2.13
otherwise of objects and so we think,393.889,2.071
it's better to think of this as the,395.96,1.29
dissemination of those kinds of,397.25,1.919
blueprints and that we think under this,399.169,2.131
Court's precedents in Sorel and in,401.3,1.979
bartnick II the dissemination of that,403.279,1.56
kind of truthful information is,404.839,1.681
protected speech and the fact that it,406.52,2.759
can be used on the downloader end and,409.279,1.89
put to unlawful ends if the person so,411.169,2.52
chooses doesn't change that fact why is,413.689,2.46
it that your clients made a CAD that,416.149,3.77
students require the use of a metal part,419.919,4.571
so detectors could work on it I know,424.49,3.299
that he has a metal a slot in which a,427.789,4.35
metal part can be placed but isn't his,432.139,3.09
intent to actually facilitate the,435.229,2.46
illegal transport of a gun through,437.689,2.94
security Your Honor I don't think that's,440.629,2.581
mr. Gross's intent he did it wasn't his,443.21,2.639
intent why didn't he make a pedal piece,445.849,2.97
a necessary part of the gun Your Honor,448.819,2.94
the record is not clear on that and I'm,451.759,1.59
not sure why he didn't but he did I,453.349,1.651
think do everything an uploader of this,455.0,1.709
kind of information could do to ensure,456.709,2.19
that when it was 3d printed the firearm,458.899,1.95
would be metal detectable,460.849,1.521
because as the record reflects at the,462.37,1.98
joint appendix 18 the design includes a,464.35,2.55
hole where a metal slug can be inputted,466.9,1.92
and indeed but it has no functional use,468.82,1.74
that's right your honor but it's our,470.56,2.1
understanding that it would be difficult,472.65999999999997,1.38
I think to to require that too to make,474.04,3.45
the metal piece be used but it's our,477.49,3.44
required your honor that's one of the,480.93,3.4
less restrictive alternatives that we,484.33,1.559
that we suggest is it wouldn't that be a,485.889,2.101
violation of the First Amendment you'd,487.99,1.709
be up here arguing that we were forcing,489.699,3.421
him to speak in the way he didn't want,493.12,1.98
to speak your honor I don't think that,495.1,1.89
we would be saying that this was a sort,496.99,1.739
of sort of compelled speech situation,498.729,1.711
and you'll write that under the,500.44,1.38
principles your honor is correct and,501.82,1.5
under the principles we think resolve,503.32,1.65
this case in Ashcroft and free and,504.97,1.56
Bartnik II that it would be still going,506.53,3.3
after groves is speech because some,509.83,2.759
third person quite apart from that,512.5889999999999,1.621
speech would be using it to commit a,514.21,1.889
criminal act it's important to note here,516.099,2.011
that just as it would be a third,518.11,2.16
person's independent choice to take this,520.27,2.25
firearm once it was assembled and use it,522.52,1.86
to commit a crime it's also an,524.38,1.47
independent choice on the part of the,525.85,1.35
downloader to choose not to insert the,527.2,2.19
metal slug that grouse has instructed,529.39,2.1
people who download this firearm to do,531.49,2.82
so we think either way that this is,534.31,4.5
still going after speech because the,538.81,2.43
government is worried that some,541.24,2.219
listeners for that speech will put it to,543.459,1.591
unlawful uses and that gets to the,545.05,1.74
second core point I would like to make,546.79,1.56
about this law being significantly,548.35,1.77
over-inclusive we think this law is,550.12,1.98
really no different than regulating all,552.1,2.179
leafleting to prevent littering of,554.279,2.711
course some recipients of leaflets as,556.99,1.86
this court said in the Schneider case,558.85,1.17
will put it to the littering use but,560.02,2.37
where the state retains the power to go,562.39,1.92
after littering primarily it is not,564.31,2.04
allowed to go after the leafleting even,566.35,2.04
though that would perhaps be a slightly,568.39,1.29
more effective way of advancing their,569.68,1.47
goals you could you speak to the import,571.15,2.37
of the statutes restriction on,573.52,2.37
publication to the internet other modes,575.89,2.55
of publication are made available you've,578.44,2.16
made an argument that making the schema,580.6,4.44
schematics available is important to,585.04,2.52
artistic and scientific and,587.56,1.86
entertainment serves other kind of,589.42,1.289
communicative values but your client has,590.7090000000001,3.361
available to him,594.07,1.019
their means of publication that is,595.0889999999999,1.92
offline sharing and just less broad and,597.009,6.171
perhaps unobservable ways of serving,603.18,4.0
those other purposes while mitigating,607.18,2.759
the risk that would be created by,609.939,3.781
Internet publication Wyson this is just,613.72,2.4
a kind of time place and manner,616.12,1.139
restriction that's tolerable in the,617.259,2.07
study circumstances sure your honor two,619.329,2.01
points on that first and foremost we do,621.3389999999999,1.92
not submit it's it's properly analyzed,623.259,2.161
as a time place manner restriction,625.42,1.289
because it's our submission that it's a,626.709,1.591
facially content-based regulation of the,628.3,1.709
speech and as this court said precisely,630.009,2.041
on point in the reno case if it is a,632.05,2.039
content-based regulation of speech than,634.0889999999999,2.131
even regulating various modalities of,636.22,2.46
internet communication as the court said,638.68,1.649
is not permissible because time place,640.329,1.8
manner analysis is not permissible for,642.129,1.62
facially content-based regulations but,643.749,2.371
your honor brings up an important point,646.12,1.769
about the use of the internet here and I,647.889,1.5
think the one piece of communication,649.389,3.06
that really can't be achieved by not,652.449,2.01
being able to share this with all the,654.4590000000001,1.411
citizens of Ames who will put it to,655.87,2.219
lawful and valuable uses is that the,658.0889999999999,2.761
Internet as this court said in Reno is a,660.85,2.7
more powerful soapbox than ever before,663.55,1.979
and as this court said in packing ham,665.529,1.41
just just two terms ago is is the,666.939,2.49
probably the most important way now that,669.429,2.611
citizens share information with each,672.04,1.649
other both to speak and to listen does,673.689,2.49
this statute prevents you from putting,676.179,3.181
up a website that would say that you,679.36,2.699
would send this to anyone who wants it,682.059,2.22
and then sending it in a drive to,684.279,2.67
somebody this does that is that,686.949,2.7
prohibited Your Honor I think that's,689.649,2.19
probably not prohibited I think,691.8389999999999,1.92
certainly I don't think the state thinks,693.759,1.68
that would be prohibited and since,695.439,1.051
that's what they argue and I don't think,696.49,2.88
that would be making the file itself,699.37,1.62
available on the internet which i think,700.99,1.5
is what the statute requires I'm sorry,702.49,3.269
why wait on a website you list that you,705.759,5.58
have this CAD program if you want to ask,711.3389999999999,3.271
us first tell us who you are right and,714.61,2.339
your honor our submission would be if we,716.949,1.68
understand the statute correctly that's,718.629,1.26
not covered by the statute exactly so,719.889,2.7
why isn't that an adequate alternative,722.589,1.761
why it's not being barred,724.35,2.22
website at all well first I think it's,726.57,2.28
the adequate alternatives analysis would,728.85,1.95
only matter if this law were evaluated,730.8,1.59
under intermediate scrutiny rather than,732.39,1.38
strict scrutiny we should which we,733.77,1.38
submit it should not be but second I,735.15,2.28
think there is still something quite,737.43,1.38
different well this is not quite speech,738.81,2.81
its speech that acts so why should it be,741.62,4.0
subject to strict scrutiny well your,745.62,1.92
honor our it's our submission that it is,747.54,1.47
speech and it's protected speech because,749.01,1.8
the Act criminalized by the statute is,750.81,2.82
not the use of this file or directing a,753.63,2.97
3d printer to do anything,756.6,1.29
it's the publication the dissemination,757.89,2.07
of this design of this blueprint from,759.96,2.64
person to person using the Internet as a,762.6,2.1
medium and we submit just as this court,764.7,1.74
said in Bartnik II and in Sorrell it,766.44,2.43
strongly suggested that when a person,768.87,1.95
has information especially truthful,770.82,1.77
information and is prevented from,772.59,1.53
disseminating it as they see fit that's,774.12,1.8
a restriction on their right to speak,775.92,1.86
are you saying this is a purse a prior,777.78,2.7
restraint on speech Your Honor we don't,780.48,2.4
evaluate it under a prior restraint,782.88,1.56
approach because unlike the the use of,784.44,3.09
the export regulations and the defense,787.53,1.47
distributed case this simply imposes a,789.0,2.64
quite severe criminal penalty so that's,791.64,2.16
after the fact you're not enjoined in,793.8,1.92
any way there hasn't been an injunction,795.72,1.86
and we don't think the statute provides,797.58,1.74
for that no but we still think just like,799.32,2.25
the use of the the ITAR law in the,801.57,3.09
defence distributed case this is a,804.66,1.29
content-based regulation of speech and,805.95,1.86
should thus be subject to strict,807.81,1.14
scrutiny,808.95,0.69
well these only been around for a long,809.64,1.44
time and maybe that's you I think you,811.08,2.85
think that's a plus but have any courts,813.93,2.58
grappled with these issues Your Honor,816.51,2.37
the defense distributed litigation in,818.88,1.53
the Fifth Circuit I think did grapple,820.41,1.47
with it but the district court there,821.88,2.22
really didn't analyze the First,824.1,1.8
Amendment issue very much at all they,825.9,1.92
because it was a prior restraint and,827.82,1.89
because the plaintiffs there were,829.71,1.59
seeking an injunction the court really,831.3,2.04
focuses an analysis on the preliminary,833.34,3.06
injunction factors and really ended up,836.4,2.01
saying that at least in that case the,838.41,1.56
United States government's interest in,839.97,1.91
preventing the dissemination of those,841.88,2.53
files overseas really overcame any,844.41,2.28
analysis here but really it's a quite,846.69,1.47
different case here precisely because,848.16,2.13
the rights to receive this information,850.29,1.35
of citizens and aims are also being,851.64,2.67
violated by this law and this Court has,854.31,1.59
said consistently that the First,855.9,2.25
Amendment protects not just the rights,858.15,1.41
of speech,859.56,0.75
but also of listeners and this gets back,860.31,2.1
to justice carnies question about the,862.41,2.01
use of the Internet we think preventing,864.42,2.46
the dissemination of this information,866.88,1.02
over the Internet,867.9,1.47
really does burden heavily the Rights of,869.37,2.58
Persons and aims who are going to put,871.95,1.71
this information to lawful and valuable,873.66,2.13
uses let me interrupt for just a minute,875.79,1.86
I mean is your position following up on,877.65,2.61
justice Sotomayor's question is your,880.26,2.16
position that the fact that there is a,882.42,1.65
significant functional aspect to the CAD,884.07,3.66
files that are downloadable albeit with,887.73,2.67
additional expertise and action by the,890.4,2.04
receiver is it your position that has no,892.44,2.55
effect on our analysis that this is,894.99,1.74
purely a content-based speech regulation,896.73,2.4
and we should overlook the technological,899.13,2.7
aspects of the information that's being,901.83,1.53
conveyed your honor right I think that,903.36,1.74
is our submission and for two important,905.1,1.98
reasons I think it would be a mistake to,907.08,1.92
follow the Corley court and other courts,909.0,2.13
that considered speech the courts the,911.13,1.98
state the state addresses in their brief,913.11,2.16
and diminished the protection of this,915.27,2.04
speech exempt it from the normal,917.31,2.279
presumption against the,919.5889999999999,1.261
constitutionality of content-based,920.85,1.41
restrictions we think that would be the,922.26,1.35
case for two reasons first Reid made,923.61,3.0
very clear that the before we get to the,926.61,2.16
government's purpose in looking at,928.77,2.069
whether a law is content-based or,930.8389999999999,1.291
content neutral we first have to ask,932.13,1.83
whether it is facially content-based on,933.96,2.129
its face or not and we submit this law,936.0889999999999,1.861
is facially content-based on its face,937.95,1.71
quite clearly it only prescribes,939.66,2.37
publication of this information if it,942.03,2.16
describes a certain kind of firearm so,944.19,1.92
that's clearly facially content-based,946.11,1.77
but again regardless of its functional,947.88,2.3
purpose so if it were a recipe to create,950.18,5.67
some toxic drug it's still a recipe no,955.85,4.42
more than that and they should overlook,960.27,1.68
the other aspects and the state is,961.95,1.889
misguided than in your view in pointing,963.839,2.941
out that the ready availability of this,966.78,3.48
recipe could undermine its whole gun,970.26,4.11
regulation scheme for in terms of,974.37,1.71
tracking guns and so on your honor it,976.08,2.25
has no import at all in your view I,978.33,1.68
think that's right your honor because I,980.01,1.5
think the state's interest would be the,981.51,1.29
same if it wanted to go after the,982.8,2.039
publication of gunsmithing manuals in,984.8389999999999,1.981
books they would still have a fear that,986.82,1.83
persons would be able to as we say in,988.65,2.55
our brief order unfinished lower,991.2,1.53
receivers and all of the,992.73,1.17
the necessary parts from the internet,993.9,1.38
which they can now do completely,995.28,1.41
unregulated and assemble those firearms,996.69,2.1
I think the interest would be the same,998.79,1.59
does it matter that your clients version,1000.38,3.15
is not a fully functional version that,1003.53,3.06
it requires some the end-user to have,1006.59,3.57
the right software to download it,1010.16,2.4
properly I think it matters to the,1012.56,2.34
analysis of whether or not this is,1014.9,1.56
speech that's itself integral to,1016.46,1.56
criminal conduct,1018.02,1.41
perhaps if this firearm if this was,1019.43,3.36
essentially equivalent to the,1022.79,2.069
distribution of the firearm itself if,1024.859,1.801
there really was no difference and no,1026.66,1.74
distance between the act of uploading,1028.4,1.919
this file to the internet and the and,1030.319,1.741
then the downloader having a working,1032.06,1.35
firearm in their hand perhaps we would,1033.41,2.37
say that it is essentially the,1035.78,1.23
distribution of a firearm there is a,1037.01,1.71
difference because doesn't themes have a,1038.72,3.27
law that you have to register any,1041.99,1.859
firearm that you possess Your Honor I'm,1043.849,3.51
not aware of that law if that law exists,1047.359,2.551
I do not believe it does i understanding,1049.91,2.13
is in a names just like under federal,1052.04,1.83
law if one manufactures a firearm for,1053.87,2.28
home use only then it does not need to,1056.15,1.8
be registered or serialized but indeed,1057.95,2.61
it's your honor raises an important,1060.56,1.86
point that other states have,1062.42,2.3
requirements just like that as we say in,1064.72,2.62
our brief at our opening brief at page,1067.34,1.5
36 the state of California has responded,1068.84,2.52
to the problem of potential 3d printing,1071.36,2.34
of firearms by requiring the,1073.7,2.07
serialization and registration of any,1075.77,1.8
firearm plastic are not manufactured at,1077.57,2.34
home and it's our understanding this,1079.91,1.65
just happened recently that New Jersey,1081.56,1.26
is about to pass a law that would outlaw,1082.82,2.46
the 3d printing of firearms altogether,1085.28,1.89
now it's our submission and our third,1087.17,1.8
argument is that where other,1088.97,1.74
jurisdictions have seen that less speech,1090.71,2.67
restrictive alternatives are effective,1093.38,2.04
and work that raises a strong,1095.42,1.62
presumption as this court put it in the,1097.04,1.44
McCullen case that the state has formed,1098.48,2.46
scuse me how do we know that they work,1100.94,1.7
well your honor it raises an inference,1102.64,3.28
that they work because these files have,1105.92,1.65
been online for five years as we say,1107.57,2.37
since Cody Wilson first put his files on,1109.94,1.86
the internet they've been easily,1111.8,0.9
findable the states have really seen no,1112.7,2.28
problems at least with single-shot,1114.98,2.88
plastic firearms and because other,1117.86,2.4
jurisdictions have seen that they're,1120.26,1.44
able to to achieve their interest or at,1121.7,2.19
least think that they will in the last,1123.89,2.16
couple of years not by going,1126.05,1.48
after speech as the state of aims is,1127.53,1.56
done here so we have to wait until,1129.09,1.68
people are murdered your I can't,1130.77,3.03
the shooter can't be traced and there's,1133.8,4.29
no way of detecting who the perpetrator,1138.09,4.47
is before states can take a prophylactic,1142.56,3.36
measure to protect themselves Your Honor,1145.92,4.59
we don't think the state has to wait for,1150.51,1.41
people to be murdered it's our,1151.92,1.5
submission that where we've provided,1153.42,1.29
many reasons why bad actors are really,1154.71,2.91
unlikely to use 3d printing as a way to,1157.62,2.19
circumvent the law they have other means,1159.81,1.59
at their disposal the state has,1161.4,1.62
especially its strict scrutiny heavy,1163.02,1.98
burden to overcome to show that it in,1165.0,2.1
fact that is not the case,1167.1,1.08
thank you we ask this court reverse,1168.18,3.47
[Music],1175.1,3.17
you may proceed madam Chief Justice and,1189.36,3.3
may it please the court my name is,1192.66,1.68
Katherine McCaffrey and on behalf of,1194.34,2.01
petitioner Ian groves I will address the,1196.35,1.86
Second Amendment issue 15 years ago mr.,1198.21,3.599
groves committed a non-violent crime,1201.809,1.261
which was classified by the state of,1203.07,1.77
aims as a misdemeanor and for which he,1204.84,1.86
received no jail time today aim seeks to,1206.7,3.0
enforce a statute that would prevent him,1209.7,1.59
from possessing any type of firearm for,1211.29,2.04
any purpose for the rest of his life the,1213.33,2.49
statute is unconstitutional as applied,1215.82,1.62
to mr. groves for two reasons first it,1217.44,3.0
is a complete and permanent deprivation,1220.44,2.19
of his fundamental right to bear arms,1222.63,1.59
and those should be subject to per se,1224.22,1.8
invalidation second at the very least,1226.02,2.789
the state cannot justify the burden at,1228.809,2.281
this ban imposes can I back you up a,1231.09,3.12
moment there are only two states left,1234.21,4.709
maybe just one that banned felons from,1238.919,3.961
ever voting and we've upheld those bans,1242.88,4.049
as the prerogative of the states why is,1246.929,4.111
it that the mere conviction of an,1251.04,3.03
individual is not a forfeiture or waiver,1254.07,3.72
of entitlement to certain constitutional,1257.79,2.85
rights including this one the possession,1260.64,2.73
of a firearm what makes this any,1263.37,2.37
different than the fundamental right to,1265.74,2.58
vote we permit states to ban that,1268.32,4.8
fundamental right why shouldn't we,1273.12,3.08
permit the government to ban the right,1276.2,4.03
to own a firearm because your honor as,1280.23,3.54
this court said in Heller the scope of,1283.77,1.86
the Second Amendment is set by the,1285.63,1.41
original public understanding of the,1287.04,1.71
right and so we need to look to practice,1288.75,1.89
at the time of the founding to,1290.64,1.44
understand what the original public,1292.08,2.099
understanding of the right was now the,1294.179,1.891
historical evidence we have uncovered,1296.07,2.0
indicates that the time of the founding,1298.07,2.109
an individual convicted of a crime was,1300.179,2.431
only stripped of their firearm rights in,1302.61,1.65
two instances when they were,1304.26,1.409
incarcerated or when they were sentenced,1305.669,1.89
to a crime punishable by death in both,1307.559,2.041
of those instances the individual also,1309.6,1.829
lost their political rights in contrast,1311.429,2.341
in cases where the individual did not,1313.77,1.59
lose their political rights upon,1315.36,1.319
conviction they did not lose their right,1316.679,1.801
to bear arms this indicate you're,1318.48,1.77
showing me the,1320.25,0.84
all those laws we've upheld denying,1321.09,2.94
convicted felons the opportunity to vote,1324.03,3.51
while they're on probation many states,1327.54,2.31
have that law all of the states that had,1329.85,4.32
lifetime voting bans those are,1334.17,2.7
unconstitutional as well no your honor,1336.87,2.97
we limit still haven't told me why you,1339.84,3.65
haven't amendment is more fundamental,1343.49,2.47
than those other rights it's certainly,1345.96,2.73
not your honor the reason we conduct the,1348.69,2.04
Second Amendment analysis in this way is,1350.73,1.8
because Heller has instructed us to do,1352.53,2.01
so the Second Amendment right to bear,1354.54,1.98
arms was the codification of a,1356.52,1.65
pre-existing right to bear arms that,1358.17,2.04
existed under British common law,1360.21,1.29
starting in the year 1689 and so the,1361.5,2.76
founding generation was not developing,1364.26,1.5
any new right they were merely codifying,1365.76,1.98
a right that already existed that's part,1367.74,2.22
of why the court in Heller Alfa's I'm,1369.96,1.53
sorry I thought our Constitution was,1371.49,2.43
creating new rights as this courts right,1373.92,3.69
not to quarters soldiers was not a,1377.61,3.66
British right it was codified in our,1381.27,4.02
Constitution because our founding,1385.29,2.19
fathers were upset that that was,1387.48,2.88
happening in Britain,1390.36,1.16
my apologies are on there that's,1391.52,1.9
certainly right the Second Amendment,1393.42,1.86
right was not at the creation of a new,1395.28,1.62
right but the codification of a,1396.9,1.86
pre-existing right to bear arms and it,1398.76,2.19
seems at the time of the founding that,1400.95,1.5
right was limited to members of the,1402.45,1.5
political community Ian groves as far as,1403.95,2.43
we know remains a member of the,1406.38,1.47
political community and that's why he,1407.85,1.83
retains his second Amendment right to,1409.68,1.56
vote does your argument depend at all on,1411.24,1.98
the fact that a misdemeanor that this,1413.22,3.39
would have been a misdemeanor and this,1416.61,1.68
would not have been a felony at the time,1418.29,1.92
of the founding under any historical,1420.21,2.73
understanding of his the crime that he,1422.94,2.7
committed just do you make that argument,1425.64,2.58
or is that not part of your argument so,1428.22,2.25
your honor that's certainly relevant,1430.47,1.35
that at the time of the founding,1431.82,1.08
individuals convicted of misdemeanors,1432.9,2.19
were not denied political rights nor,1435.09,1.68
were they denied the right to possess a,1436.77,1.65
firearm however even if this court,1438.42,2.31
chooses not to look merely at the,1440.73,1.53
historical analysis we ask this court to,1442.26,2.34
confine the scope of the Second,1444.6,1.8
Amendment right to the original public,1446.4,1.95
understanding of the political community,1448.35,1.41
and then turn and ask today who is a,1449.76,2.49
member of the political community,1452.25,1.59
Ian groves remained a member excuse me,1453.84,1.709
an individual like Ian groves remained a,1455.549,2.161
member of the political community and,1457.71,1.349
thus retained his right to bear arms at,1459.059,1.591
the time of the founding and he does so,1460.65,1.529
today so under either analysis,1462.179,2.071
Ian groves retains the second Amendment,1464.25,1.529
right so just does that mean that if,1465.779,3.27
your historical analysis is correct that,1469.049,2.391
felons should be able to recover their,1471.44,2.65
arms when they're released from prison I,1474.09,2.01
think your brief pointed out that it was,1476.1,2.699
only when incarcerated that they,1478.799,3.601
surrendered that right so your honor,1482.4,2.94
that's certainly a more difficult,1485.34,1.65
question to answer what we know is that,1486.99,2.25
at present the vast majority of states,1489.24,2.069
limit the political rights of felons at,1491.309,3.451
at least some time I think if we look at,1494.76,2.1
the current political landscape the best,1496.86,2.069
way to describe the felons position in,1498.929,2.461
the political community is contested so,1501.39,2.82
that individual may regain their right,1504.21,1.709
to bear arms to say so conclusively,1505.919,1.74
would require a little bit more,1507.659,1.02
historical analysis do we need to look,1508.679,1.98
at the political community definition in,1510.659,1.951
each of the states that justice,1512.61,1.319
Sotomayor was referring to as to whether,1513.929,3.151
who when felons have rights to vote when,1517.08,2.37
they don't so Your Honor we've put forth,1519.45,2.969
the theory that the political community,1522.419,1.681
is determined on a national scale,1524.1,1.53
because we're not talking about any,1525.63,1.56
specific case excuse me,1527.19,1.53
State Constitution here we're asking,1528.72,2.1
about the Federal Constitution which is,1530.82,1.859
at one point in time you're asking us to,1532.679,1.831
look at the founding fathers but should,1534.51,3.269
we look at it in the time of the Wild,1537.779,3.541
West should we look at it today should,1541.32,4.02
we look at it 50 years ago how do we,1545.34,2.25
decide what moment that national,1547.59,3.93
consensus was founded so your honor,1551.52,3.269
there's actually two moving parts to,1554.789,1.591
this analysis if I may explain first is,1556.38,2.789
where we set the rule for what is the,1559.169,2.01
scope of the political community now the,1561.179,3.24
court in Heller tells us that we need to,1564.419,1.441
look to the original public,1565.86,1.08
understanding of the rule the Heller,1566.94,1.8
Court limited its analysis through the,1568.74,2.01
end of the 1800s and so we encourage the,1570.75,2.52
court to do the same today,1573.27,1.32
once the scope of the Second Amendment,1574.59,1.89
has been set the rule has been set as,1576.48,2.13
the political community we then turn to,1578.61,2.46
today today who is a member of that,1581.07,2.46
political community so we're asking this,1583.53,2.07
court to determine the now,1585.6,1.28
no consensus today as to who retains,1586.88,2.25
political rights you mean it have to do,1589.13,1.98
that can you win just on a straight-up,1591.11,2.9
analysis that your as-applied challenges,1594.01,3.91
is good for a misdemeanor and no one's,1597.92,4.83
ever made that yet it's been held by,1602.75,2.73
heard by our court on that point can we,1605.48,3.3
just do we have to don't do this,1608.78,2.4
originalist analysis in order to rule,1611.18,2.61
for your client so it's true your honor,1613.79,2.88
that no excuse me none of the lower,1616.67,1.92
courts besides the Third Circuit in,1618.59,1.56
bender up has considered a case like,1620.15,1.89
this where the individual at issue was a,1622.04,2.01
misdemeanant,1624.05,0.69
and in the bender up case the court,1624.74,1.47
found that the law was unconstitutional,1626.21,1.55
as applied to that individual this Court,1627.76,3.25
does need to answer two questions the,1631.01,2.01
first is whether Ian groves has the,1633.02,1.71
right and the second is whether the,1634.73,1.74
burden on that right is justified so to,1636.47,2.16
determine who has the right we ask this,1638.63,2.52
court to look to the original public,1641.15,1.44
understanding of the Constitution that's,1642.59,1.29
assuming we believe he was convicted of,1643.88,2.94
a misdemeanor generally the definition,1646.82,2.79
of felon has always been someone who can,1649.61,3.69
be jailed for over a year and under the,1653.3,2.79
crime he committed he could have been,1656.09,1.59
jailed for more than two years far above,1657.68,2.79
the minimum that most felons are,1660.47,4.37
announced it's only the oddities of this,1664.84,3.31
state Ames a state that makes this amis,1668.15,4.59
misdemeanor so why shouldn't we use the,1672.74,5.25
normal understanding of felons you're,1677.99,3.18
asking us to use the original,1681.17,1.74
understanding of who's a part of the,1682.91,3.36
political community but you're not,1686.27,1.41
asking us to do that with respect to,1687.68,2.43
who's a felon two things your honor,1690.11,2.46
first if this court was operating under,1692.57,2.85
what was the definition of a felony or,1695.42,1.86
misdemeanor at the time of the founding,1697.28,1.35
Ian groves his crime forgery was,1698.63,2.1
considered to be a misdemeanor at the,1700.73,1.23
time of the founding now the reason that,1701.96,2.28
it's important to note that Ian groves,1704.24,2.01
is a misdemeanant,1706.25,0.9
is because when it comes to political,1707.15,1.86
rights the line between felons and,1709.01,1.59
misdemeanants is actually pretty clear,1710.6,1.92
now the vast majority of states only,1712.52,2.01
limit political rights for felons and in,1714.53,2.55
the states that do have misdemeanors,1717.08,1.62
punishable by more than one year,1718.7,1.68
that includes Ames but it also includes,1720.38,1.62
states like South Carolina and,1722.0,1.62
Pennsylvania in those states the states,1723.62,2.73
only limit political rights for,1726.35,1.53
individuals classified as felons what,1727.88,2.58
this tells us is that the classification,1730.46,1.8
of the offense is dispositive when it,1732.26,2.16
comes to political rights if I could ask,1734.42,2.25
in your briefs you describe mr. groves,1736.67,3.84
as they never incarcerated nonviolent,1740.51,2.76
misdemeanant our conversation right now,1743.27,3.03
has been focusing on whether he's a,1746.3,1.44
misdemeanant,1747.74,0.75
or a felon but I wondered whether how,1748.49,2.49
the other two aspects of his prior,1750.98,2.61
convictions play into the rule that you,1753.59,3.18
would propose this is an as-applied,1756.77,2.06
challenge and you know you have a,1758.83,5.04
persuasive argument that he poses very,1763.87,3.25
little risk but I wondered you know we,1767.12,2.49
have struggled in defining what is a,1769.61,1.94
violent crime or a non-violent crime,1771.55,2.44
what might be just looking at elements,1773.99,1.86
is purse-snatching for example a violent,1775.85,2.1
crime that would disqualify someone and,1777.95,2.61
I wonder what rule you would propose,1780.56,1.68
that we be adopting if we were to take,1782.24,3.45
your general position with regard to mr.,1785.69,3.18
groves sure your honor,1788.87,2.04
so first just to clarify the reason that,1790.91,2.49
we discussed the relative dangerousness,1793.4,1.86
of the category of individuals never,1795.26,2.07
incarcerated nonviolent misdemeanants is,1797.33,2.34
because we didn't want to focus our,1799.67,1.14
analysis specifically on mr. groves,1800.81,2.19
because we didn't want to convey to this,1803.0,1.62
court that we were asking for perfect,1804.62,1.68
tailoring that's concededly not the,1806.3,1.8
analysis here the state must only show,1808.1,2.1
narrow tailoring,1810.2,0.96
however we put forth that because never,1811.16,3.15
incarcerated nonviolent misdemeanants as,1814.31,1.95
a class pose no heightened risk of gun,1816.26,2.31
violence or they certainly don't pose a,1818.57,1.59
heightened risk for life that shows that,1820.16,2.07
this law is not just slightly over broad,1822.23,2.43
but that it's dramatically over broad,1824.66,1.68
but I'm sorry what difference does it,1826.34,2.4
make whether it's a felon violent or,1828.74,3.63
nonviolent in your theory of this case,1832.37,3.29
your theory of the cases we go back to,1835.66,2.83
original intent and you tell us that,1838.49,3.96
back then the only people who were,1842.45,2.61
deprived of a gun were felons in jail or,1845.06,3.45
people who were subject to capital death,1848.51,2.75
so is your theory founded on him being a,1851.26,5.28
non-violent miscreant I don't quite,1856.54,4.12
understand what's the purpose,1860.66,1.98
where are you asking us to draw the line,1862.64,1.8
sure your honor so this analysis,1864.44,2.97
involves a two separate questions the,1867.41,2.28
first is whether the individual,1869.69,1.41
possesses a right to bear arms that,1871.1,2.07
depends on if they remember the,1873.17,1.17
political community and so there is,1874.34,1.8
where the classification is misdemeanor,1876.14,1.71
or felony is dispositive now when we get,1877.85,2.64
to the second step of the analysis so,1880.49,1.74
you think three felons of any kind are,1882.23,2.91
not part of the political community they,1885.14,3.09
may not be your honor as I was,1888.23,2.01
discussing with justice Carney and that,1890.24,2.04
question is a little bit more difficult,1892.28,1.62
to answer because the vast majority of,1893.9,2.19
states 48 to be exact a strip political,1896.09,2.64
rights from felons though many do give,1898.73,1.98
these political rights back so it's a,1900.71,1.59
little bit more difficult of a question,1902.3,1.38
to answer than in the case of an,1903.68,1.68
individual classified as a misdemeanant,1905.36,1.92
the vast majority of states do not strip,1907.28,2.01
any political rights from these,1909.29,1.23
individuals but there's two questions,1910.52,3.12
before this court and I'd like to make,1913.64,1.47
that clear the first is the historical,1915.11,2.04
question which answers whether Ian Gross,1917.15,1.8
has a second Amendment right but the,1918.95,1.89
second is the question of whether the,1920.84,1.41
burden imposed by that right is,1922.25,1.5
justified now to begin because this law,1923.75,3.9
is a permanent deprivation of the right,1927.65,2.4
to bear arms we argue that it should be,1930.05,2.16
held to be per se unconstitutional but,1932.21,2.76
even if this court were to proceed,1934.97,1.32
through a scrutiny analysis the law,1936.29,2.13
still can't pass scrutiny because the,1938.42,2.04
state has failed to put forth sufficient,1940.46,1.95
evidence to indicate that this that,1942.41,2.43
excuse me that depriving an individual,1944.84,1.68
like Ian groves is necessary in any way,1946.52,2.07
to prevent gun violence now the state,1948.59,2.1
relies on two studies to come to its,1950.69,1.8
conclusion but we urge his court not to,1952.49,2.01
rely on those two studies too heavily,1954.5,1.62
that's because these studies focus their,1956.12,2.19
analysis mainly on prisoners within the,1958.31,2.22
first few years of their convictions but,1960.53,2.1
in contrast Ian groves was never,1962.63,1.92
sentenced to incarceration and his crime,1964.55,1.77
was over 15 years ago so those groups,1966.32,2.25
are just too different and even if in,1968.57,2.64
the abstract it were reasonable for the,1971.21,1.92
court to come to excuse me for the state,1973.13,1.86
to come to the conclusion that it did in,1974.99,1.68
light of the evidence that we've put,1976.67,1.62
forth that suggests an individual like,1978.29,1.74
Ian groves never poses an increase,1980.03,1.95
excuse me,1981.98,1.2
never poses an increase,1983.18,1.12
risk of violence or certainly doesn't,1984.3,1.65
after a term of seven to ten years we,1985.95,1.77
argued that the state's conclusion is,1987.72,1.92
just not a reasonable conclusion drawed,1989.64,1.71
from such so what a reasonable time,1991.35,1.98
limit to bar him under your theory here,1993.33,4.92
you make a great deal of the fact that,1998.25,1.77
it was a non-violent conviction and he,2000.02,3.3
has not been a reservist for fifteen,2003.32,2.1
years says five enough it's chann enough,2005.42,2.97
is what's enough so based on the,2008.39,4.29
consensus of recent social science it,2012.68,3.24
seems to be that after a period of ten,2015.92,1.92
years the relative risk of an offender a,2017.84,2.43
non-violent offender decreases to the,2020.27,2.28
point that it meets the relative risk of,2022.55,1.92
a non offender and essentially the,2024.47,1.8
individual poses no risk at all now this,2026.27,2.13
is this is also we can also find support,2028.4,3.24
for this in the practices of the US,2031.64,1.86
Sentencing Commission which holds that,2033.5,1.8
after ten years an individual's prior,2035.3,2.22
conviction should not be considered in,2037.52,1.71
calculating a criminal history so are,2039.23,2.19
you asking us to use a ten year period,2041.42,2.61
to bar misdemeanors and people who,2044.03,2.91
commit misdemeanors from having firearms,2046.94,2.61
is that your is that what you're,2049.55,1.83
advocating here today at the very least,2051.38,2.549
your honor we also put forth evidence I,2053.929,1.861
thought you said it was per se,2055.79,1.44
unconstitutional yes your so which is it,2057.23,3.92
your honor a lifetime permanent and,2061.15,2.83
complete deprivation of the fundamental,2063.98,1.98
right to bear arms is per se,2065.96,1.59
unconstitutional a firearms restriction,2067.55,2.73
that is limited in time or limited in,2070.28,2.1
scope in some way may be constitutional,2072.38,2.43
if the state can show that it is,2074.81,1.74
justified now it's our contention that,2076.55,2.07
an individual like Ian groves never,2078.62,1.95
posed a heightened risk of gun violence,2080.57,1.56
and so if I love showing does the state,2082.13,2.31
have to make so your honor that depends,2084.44,3.0
on the level of scrutiny that this court,2087.44,1.62
chooses to analyze this law under we get,2089.06,2.22
districts if we're strict scrutiny,2091.28,1.649
because we're out of her save and what,2092.929,2.071
level of showing so what the state needs,2095.0,2.67
to show is that it was a reasonable,2097.67,1.44
inference based on substantial evidence,2099.11,2.28
the problem with the state's evidence is,2101.39,2.01
that there's simply not enough for there,2103.4,1.56
to be under any definition of the term,2104.96,1.59
substantial evidence to indicate an,2106.55,2.16
individual like Ian groves,2108.71,1.38
poses a heightened risk that's why the,2110.09,1.98
state can't succeed under either strict,2112.07,2.22
or intermediate scrutiny but I like it's,2114.29,2.91
not,2117.2,0.48
that people who have not been recidivist,2117.68,3.03
for 15 years that all of them fail to,2120.71,5.67
commit a crime it's just that the,2126.38,2.37
numbers are small so why should we upset,2128.75,3.99
the state's judgment that even a small,2132.74,3.03
number of potential recidivist is enough,2135.77,4.819
to justify a lifetime ban because your,2140.589,4.361
honor the second Amendment right to bear,2144.95,1.59
arms as this Court has said is a,2146.54,1.559
fundamental right and and no amount of,2148.099,2.881
justification put forth by the state can,2150.98,2.43
justify the total stripping of that,2153.41,1.8
fundamental right that's why we ask that,2155.21,1.71
this court reverse thank you respondents,2156.92,9.29
thank you madam Chief Justice and may it,2173.319,1.89
please the court my name is Marlon,2175.209,2.25
golden and I represent the state of Ames,2177.459,1.681
I will show that the Ames felon in,2179.14,2.28
possession law does not offend the,2181.42,1.589
Second Amendment,2183.009,0.78
my co-counsel Nick Carr will show the 3d,2183.789,2.76
printed gun violence prevention act does,2186.549,2.07
not violate the First Amendment we ask,2188.619,2.311
the court to affirm on both counts the,2190.93,2.849
right to bear arms does not extend a,2193.779,1.71
person's our society has long thought,2195.489,2.13
too dangerous to carry lethal weapons,2197.619,2.071
when he committed his crimes,2199.69,2.129
petitioner forfeited the Second,2201.819,1.621
Amendment guarantee and even if the,2203.44,2.579
Second Amendment protects a right to,2206.019,1.59
bear arms the petitioner enjoys he has,2207.609,2.581
not shown that the law as,2210.19,1.319
unconstitutional as applied to him at,2211.509,2.46
the founding would have been found too,2213.969,1.83
dangerous we believe so justice Elrod,2215.799,2.851
under what theory he would be considered,2218.65,2.639
an unvirtuous citizen at the founding,2221.289,1.891
your honor because he would have,2223.18,1.079
committed crimes that represent severe,2224.259,2.641
maladjustment and disrespect for the law,2226.9,1.98
forgery would have been considered it,2228.88,4.169
would have stripped him is under the,2233.049,2.341
founding you have some authority for,2235.39,1.379
that just justice or odd that's correct,2236.769,2.79
we believe that the founding level,2239.559,2.55
sources show that the number of felonies,2242.109,2.64
even before the felonies had made their,2244.749,2.76
way from English common law to the,2247.509,1.891
United States had already balloon so we,2249.4,2.609
have information that shows that even,2252.009,2.52
Blackstone and his commentaries in law,2254.529,2.01
of England said that there were at least,2256.539,1.41
160 felonies at that time we believe I,2257.949,2.431
think thought your adversary said that,2260.38,3.409
forgery was a misdemeanor at the,2263.789,2.651
founding well chief justice Sotomayor,2266.44,2.879
even if that were so that does not,2269.319,2.01
resolve this case the traditional,2271.329,2.01
definition of a felony is someone who is,2273.339,1.92
punishable by a year imprisonment or,2275.259,2.04
more and which we look to the tradition,2277.299,2.52
that the understanding at the founding,2279.819,1.71
she's arguing founding what do you,2281.529,2.73
arguing we argue that we argue that the,2284.259,2.19
traditional restrictions on felons that,2286.449,2.971
is those who are punishable by at least,2289.42,1.589
a year in prison or what just additional,2291.009,2.34
since when what we believe at Lisa's,2293.349,3.18
traditional as this court noted in,2296.529,1.44
Heller,2297.969,0.51
so in Heller this court said that,2298.479,2.191
long-standing prohibitions not founding,2300.67,2.76
era Probus so you talk about the,2303.43,1.439
nineteen there,2304.869,0.861
is that what you're talking about at,2305.73,2.76
least dating back to the interwar period,2308.49,1.8
justice Elrod but we believe history is,2310.29,2.16
instructive here as well for example the,2312.45,2.24
Pennsylvania Minority Report the dissent,2314.69,2.98
of minority at this Pennsylvania State,2317.67,1.44
ratification convention showed that the,2319.11,2.31
right to bear arms could be restricted,2321.42,2.1
for crimes committed or for risk of,2323.52,2.49
public and injury and we believe that,2326.01,2.07
understanding is what's informative here,2328.08,2.19
today so it's true that the authors of,2330.27,2.37
one state what other documents can you,2332.64,2.61
point to to show us how other states,2335.25,2.94
responded Chief Justice Emily or that,2338.19,2.73
was one state it was shared however by,2340.92,2.07
the drafters in Massachusetts in New,2342.99,2.73
Hampshire all of those states were,2345.72,2.07
penned by anti-federalists who,2347.79,2.16
eventually want out with the,2349.95,1.35
ratification of the Bill of Rights,2351.3,1.26
itself so it's their understanding of,2352.56,2.46
the Second Amendment that the right is,2355.02,1.8
not unlimited that Heller identified it,2356.82,2.28
said that the scope of the right did not,2359.1,2.94
extend to those long-standing,2362.04,1.68
prohibitions that were understood to be,2363.72,2.79
outside the scope of the right entirely,2366.51,1.89
now Heller tells us that these are,2368.4,2.1
exceptions to the Second Amendment right,2370.5,2.07
well Hilary knowledge is a presumption,2372.57,2.67
but doesn't really articulate at any,2375.24,2.7
great length um as for felonies and for,2377.94,3.44
people with mental illness and,2381.38,2.05
acknowledges that the list is not,2383.43,1.32
exhaustive but it also recognizes a,2384.75,2.37
fundamental right to bear arms which,2387.12,2.4
hadn't been articulated in that way,2389.52,1.77
before and I wonder how the state can,2391.29,2.21
justify under intermediate scrutiny say,2393.5,3.19
a lifetime ban where the right is seen,2396.69,4.95
as necessary to for people to defend,2401.64,2.85
themselves why should someone who has,2404.49,3.33
been convicted of such a an offense as,2407.82,3.15
this that didn't even merit jail time he,2410.97,3.44
deprived of the right to defend his,2414.41,1.96
family well justice Carney all I'll take,2416.37,2.31
your question about the presumptively,2418.68,2.13
lawful and the scope of the right first,2420.81,1.83
which is if you read the opinion in the,2422.64,2.88
Heller delivered the court in Heller,2425.52,1.35
delivered and its entirety it showed,2426.87,1.59
that everything hinged on the fact that,2428.46,1.86
petitioner in that case dick Heller was,2430.32,2.25
not disqualified from the exercise of,2432.57,1.89
second Amendment rights in the first,2434.46,1.35
place the court also grouped this,2435.81,2.04
discussion of the long stain,2437.85,1.219
prohibitions alongside its decision in,2439.069,2.73
United States versus Miller and that,2441.799,1.92
dates back to the 1930s where it said,2443.719,1.74
that sawed-off shotguns were,2445.459,2.01
presumptively categorically outside the,2447.469,2.431
Second Amendment right and so even if we,2449.9,2.819
believe that the presumptively lawful,2452.719,1.921
language refers to a rebuttable,2454.64,2.159
presumption which of course the state,2456.799,1.381
contests we believe that the burden that,2458.18,3.359
the petitioner in this case would have,2461.539,2.04
to show is that he is in some meaningful,2463.579,3.301
way different from the historically,2466.88,2.399
barred class and he's failed to carry,2469.279,2.52
that burden well let me follow up in,2471.799,1.95
just a second you said presumptively,2473.749,1.32
Roth lawful doesn't mean that it's a,2475.069,2.28
rebuttable presumption I mean the state,2477.349,2.16
can take whatever measures it wants with,2479.509,2.58
regard to felons and denying them right,2482.089,1.98
and there there's no examination that is,2484.069,2.341
appropriate justice Carney that's,2486.41,2.699
correct when a felon commits his crimes,2489.109,3.031
and is punishable by a sentence of up to,2492.14,2.459
five years in prison in this case he has,2494.599,3.15
forfeited his rights toothless's,2497.749,1.891
guarantee is right to bear arms to vote,2499.64,2.669
to serve on a jury to seek public office,2502.309,2.341
this Court has noted as much in its,2504.65,2.25
decisions such as Richardson versus,2506.9,1.5
Ramirez and we do not believe that the,2508.4,1.949
Second Amendment right stands in any way,2510.349,2.22
in contrast to those rights which as a,2512.569,2.97
matter of legislative grace the states,2515.539,2.16
do often permit as the petitioner in,2517.699,2.34
this case argues but that is not the,2520.039,1.861
same as a constitutional requirement so,2521.9,2.899
what do you do with the cases that we,2524.799,2.621
have to deal with people sexual,2527.42,3.389
predators for example and they're barred,2530.809,2.19
for a time period from their computers,2532.999,2.22
but there have been cases discussing,2535.219,1.56
that they cannot be barred forever from,2536.779,2.7
having access to a computer why why is,2539.479,3.99
that situation different well justice or,2543.469,3.39
I'd I would first note that again we,2546.859,2.581
believe that felons categorically,2549.44,2.22
forfeit their right to bear arms so long,2551.66,2.189
as they remain a felon so Heller,2553.849,2.281
referred to felons in the mentally ill,2556.13,1.859
in the present tense and this tells us,2557.989,2.61
something important which is that so,2560.599,1.71
long as someone remains a felon the,2562.309,2.22
state has not violated any,2564.529,1.351
constitutional right when it with holds,2565.88,1.979
from him the right to possess a firearm,2567.859,1.89
now when that status changed,2569.749,2.251
if a state continued to bar someone from,2572.0,3.359
continuing to own a firearm we believe,2575.359,2.611
that we might have a closer case what,2577.97,2.31
I'm sorry I'm a little confused how do,2580.28,3.6
you not become a felon are you taking,2583.88,3.93
their position that well you're under a,2587.81,2.43
criminal sentence you're a felon but,2590.24,2.67
once you leave a federal sentence you no,2592.91,2.91
longer are this man served his time on,2595.82,3.23
probation and he's been incident free,2599.05,3.819
for 15 years I'm not quite sure what you,2602.869,2.041
mean,2604.91,0.42
stop being a felon she certainly should,2605.33,2.7
justice Sotomayor what we mean is that,2608.03,1.71
someone would have to have either their,2609.74,1.98
rights restored the record expunged or,2611.72,2.49
would have to receive a pardon and the,2614.21,2.76
statute that aims is adopted of course,2616.97,2.19
references federal law provides that,2619.16,2.19
someone even with those conditions might,2621.35,2.88
have is an explicit restriction imposed,2624.23,2.129
upon them upon expungement or pardoned,2626.359,3.301
that they still are not able to possess,2629.66,1.59
a firearm and we believe a rights,2631.25,1.92
restored that's a civil rights restored,2633.17,3.23
we believe that's probably what that,2636.4,2.23
means yes and so are you taking the,2638.63,4.08
position that the petitioner in this,2642.71,2.7
case didn't have his rights restored,2645.41,1.73
well the record is civil rights restored,2647.14,2.53
the record is silent on that she's best,2649.67,2.58
I said in my or but we if we even if we,2652.25,2.04
assume that his rights have been,2654.29,2.01
restored in this case the political,2656.3,2.61
community argument petitioner has,2658.91,1.29
identified simply does not resolve felon,2660.2,2.669
and possession challenges if it did it,2662.869,3.031
would mean that states that allow,2665.9,1.98
currently incarcerated persons to vote,2667.88,2.28
such as Maine and Vermont would stand in,2670.16,2.34
violation of the Second Amendment when,2672.5,1.83
they prevented that person from,2674.33,1.65
exercising a right to bear arms if,2675.98,3.75
you're wrong about that it's a felony,2679.73,3.03
and that it's truly a misdemeanor assume,2682.76,3.0
arguendo it's a misdemeanor do you can,2685.76,2.76
you still win we can Justice elrod no,2688.52,3.87
okay can you give any example,2692.39,2.91
demeanor violation suspends a,2695.3,2.07
constitutional right forever well,2697.37,2.67
justice eller I would believe this is a,2700.04,1.38
situation analogous to the sixth,2701.42,2.04
amendment context so the court has said,2703.46,2.19
in Lewis that certain misdemeanors are,2705.65,2.46
serious enough to trigger the jury trial,2708.11,1.98
right other misdemeanors are mere petty,2710.09,2.34
offenses it has chosen an objective,2712.43,2.49
indicator of seriousness in those cases,2714.92,1.95
and it is looked to the maximum,2716.87,2.1
punishable sentence we ask the court to,2718.97,2.64
follow a similar path here certain,2721.61,2.46
misdemeanor crimes are so grave that,2724.07,2.28
they are functionally felonies and the,2726.35,2.76
states have long understood that they do,2729.11,2.31
not offend the Second Amendment when,2731.42,2.07
they prevent people who have committed,2733.49,1.74
those crimes from owning a gun because,2735.23,2.43
they are more likely to abuse a firearm,2737.66,2.31
as a fact of their criminal record now,2739.97,3.3
this accords with long-standing,2743.27,2.1
understandings of what state,2745.37,2.67
legislatures and what Congress can do,2748.04,2.7
and analyzing the types of people who,2750.74,2.97
are more likely to commit gun violence,2753.71,1.74
in the future the court said in Heller,2755.45,1.86
that certain policy choices were taken,2757.31,2.61
off the table it also said at the,2759.92,2.28
conclusion of its opinion that this did,2762.2,2.07
not leave the states powerless to combat,2764.27,2.04
the problem of gun violence in this,2766.31,1.35
country and so felon in possession laws,2767.66,2.46
like the one that Ames has enacted is,2770.12,2.01
valid policy choice exercised by the,2772.13,3.0
states and all of its applications so,2775.13,2.4
you're using it as a use in the status,2777.53,2.22
of felon as a proxy for dangerousness,2779.75,3.06
and yet not taking into account the,2782.81,2.76
lapse of time the non violent nature of,2785.57,1.92
the offense the fact that no time was,2787.49,2.1
served and or in no time was included in,2789.59,2.61
the sentence it seems like a very,2792.2,1.44
imperfect match doesn't the state have,2793.64,5.37
an obligation in light of the,2799.01,2.03
fundamental fundamental nature of the,2801.04,2.47
right to do better tailoring well,2803.51,2.58
justice Carney of two answers there,2806.09,1.8
first is that the unvirtuous citizen,2807.89,2.7
rationale that has long animated gun,2810.59,3.06
safety laws is not limited to a showing,2813.65,3.06
of future dangerousness now if it were,2816.71,1.65
so the statute in this case 922 G would,2818.36,3.75
not include people like those who've,2822.11,1.77
renounce their citizenship for example,2823.88,1.86
so second if we assume how,2825.74,2.85
for that the showing of future,2828.59,1.53
dangerousness is what justifies Ames's,2830.12,3.0
felon in possession law and nothing else,2833.12,1.68
then the state can succeed if it burdens,2834.8,3.18
a right petitioner enjoys under,2837.98,1.62
intermediate scrutiny but aren't you,2839.6,1.65
using the status of being a felon as a,2841.25,2.34
proxy for dangerousness I thought that's,2843.59,1.65
what I was just hearing you argue we do,2845.24,2.52
believe that there's significant,2847.76,1.41
correlation there Justice Carney we,2849.17,2.22
believe that the legislators do not err,2851.39,2.22
when they believe that those who,2853.61,1.77
committed crimes in the past and have a,2855.38,2.28
track record for violating the law are,2857.66,2.1
more likely to violate the law in the,2859.76,2.55
future and do so in a way that offends,2862.31,1.98
public safety and community security and,2864.29,2.91
so as applied to mr. groves who,2867.2,1.98
committed a misdemeanor of forging a an,2869.18,3.72
ID 17 years ago and has been law abiding,2872.9,3.93
since then I think your adversary would,2876.83,1.86
say that doesn't predict violence of any,2878.69,3.48
type how can you can test that well we,2882.17,3.06
disagreed there your honor and the,2885.23,1.41
reason that we disagree is because the,2886.64,2.52
court would have to require a more,2889.16,1.83
exacting standard in order to struck,2890.99,2.25
strike down the state's law it does not,2893.24,2.16
need to show that as applied to an,2895.4,2.04
individual person who is a state law,2897.44,1.77
misdemeanor that the law passes,2899.21,2.22
intermediate scrutiny rather it only,2901.43,1.98
needs to show that the law is valid as,2903.41,2.85
applied to that class of persons that,2906.26,2.37
the state reasonably believes posed a,2908.63,2.28
future increased risk of harm to others,2910.91,2.66
is it only to gun regulation of felons,2913.57,4.15
that we apply intermediate scrutiny or,2917.72,3.72
is it your position that all regulation,2921.44,2.79
of firearms is subject to strict,2924.23,2.28
scrutiny chief justice Sotomayor of,2926.51,3.6
course there are only a handful of cases,2930.11,3.33
dealing with the Second Amendment,2933.44,1.46
explicitly at the Supreme Court now the,2934.9,2.32
courts of appeals have applied,2937.22,1.83
intermediate scrutiny to any number of,2939.05,2.1
restrictions on the right to bear arms,2941.15,2.25
we only however proceed to strict,2943.4,2.85
scrutiny if the right that is restricted,2946.25,3.18
by the law is at the core of the Second,2949.43,3.21
Amendment right now felons as a class,2952.64,2.49
can never sit at the core of the second,2955.13,2.73
Amendment right because they have,2957.86,1.02
forfeited the right to bear arms,2958.88,1.62
entirely,2960.5,1.2
second even if we assume that,2961.7,2.16
presumptively lawful means that we have,2963.86,2.58
a rebuttable presumption here that,2966.44,1.92
language in the court's opinion in,2968.36,1.35
Heller must be given some weight and it,2969.71,1.89
can't be squared with strict scrutiny,2971.6,1.47
but usually means something can actually,2973.07,3.6
but it so what in your judgment would,2976.67,3.63
that be well chief justice Sotomayor the,2980.3,3.24
rebuttable presumption if as-applied,2983.54,1.38
challenges are allowed would come in,2984.92,1.92
those close cases where we're unsure,2986.84,2.25
whether someone can validly still be,2989.09,2.79
considered a felon so for example in the,2991.88,2.94
only Circuit Court of Appeals to ever,2994.82,2.19
uphold a as-applied challenge to an,2997.01,2.85
individual felon the person and the,2999.86,2.76
challengers in that case had already,3002.62,1.35
seat received relief under state law in,3003.97,3.0
state court but nevertheless was still,3006.97,2.43
subject to the federal prohibition so we,3009.4,2.34
can imagine the opposite being true as,3011.74,1.65
well now we can also imagine cases where,3013.39,2.67
someone has received their civil rights,3016.06,3.0
restored or received a pardon had the,3019.06,2.46
record expunged by a court but,3021.52,1.74
nevertheless under the statute is still,3023.26,1.95
prohibited from owning a firearm and,3025.21,2.07
while we still believe that law likely,3027.28,2.46
could pass for name we believe that,3029.74,1.44
would be a closer case and that would be,3031.18,1.8
the kind of as-applied challenge the,3032.98,1.68
court would accept because it would be,3034.66,1.44
answering a key question is this person,3036.1,2.61
still a felon,3038.71,1.14
in this case there's no doubt petitioner,3039.85,3.15
status has not changed and if and until,3043.0,2.82
that changes the state of aims does not,3045.82,2.64
stand in violation of the Second,3048.46,1.65
Amendment and enforcing its felon in,3050.11,1.8
possession law against several now some,3051.91,3.3
have some have criticized this approach,3055.21,3.57
that you're discussing this intermediate,3058.78,1.71
approach is treating the Second,3060.49,2.22
Amendment as a second class right would,3062.71,3.66
you agree that a publisher who was,3066.37,3.18
convicted of a misdemeanor could not,3069.55,3.54
have his publication rights suspended,3073.09,3.18
for the rest of his life,3076.27,2.18
justice aura we have we have two answers,3078.45,2.26
there first is that we don't advise,3080.71,2.28
intermediate scrutiny I'm not the first,3082.99,1.95
person to ask that question certainly we,3084.94,3.99
don't believe intermediate scrutiny is,3088.93,1.65
necessary here we believe that text,3090.58,2.13
history and tradition of the sex,3092.71,2.119
definitively resolve this question,3094.829,2.221
felons categorically lie outside the,3097.05,2.799
scope of the Second Amendment now to,3099.849,2.401
answer your question about the publisher,3102.25,1.44
in the First Amendment question I would,3103.69,2.55
need to say that the rights proceed from,3106.24,3.119
different historical rationales so,3109.359,2.401
whereas someone who is prohibited from,3111.76,3.12
engaging in the marketplace of ideas has,3114.88,2.729
had a disability worked upon him to,3117.609,2.431
engage in the fundamental right of,3120.04,1.44
freedom of expression someone who is,3121.48,3.119
violated by a statute that prohibits,3124.599,3.331
someone when he belongs to a class that,3127.93,2.52
is shown to be more dangerous that is a,3130.45,2.43
simple exercise of the state police,3132.88,1.8
power it is justified not as a punitive,3134.68,2.25
measure against him but by a exercise of,3136.93,2.88
the state's ability to protect public,3139.81,2.519
safety so you're saying we are supposed,3142.329,2.01
to treat the first and second,3144.339,1.351
differently is that what you're saying,3145.69,2.129
just justice Elrod we believe that the,3147.819,2.461
Second Amendment guarantee is just as,3150.28,2.309
fundamental as the first we only say,3152.589,1.801
that different purposes animate a felon,3154.39,2.91
in possession law as opposed to those,3157.3,2.67
that would hypo was a misdemeanor even a,3159.97,3.54
state law misdemeanor that might be,3163.51,2.099
subject to a traditional felon in,3165.609,2.671
possession law because of the virtue of,3168.28,1.98
the number of years that he can be,3170.26,1.2
placed in a term of years in prison so,3171.46,3.0
if we understand that the long-standing,3174.46,2.94
tradition of felon in possession laws,3177.4,2.52
that this court said was lawful in,3179.92,2.55
Heller remains just as lawful today the,3182.47,3.03
only reason that the court could find,3185.5,1.71
for the petitioner is if he was able to,3187.21,2.55
distinguish himself from the mine-run of,3189.76,2.25
cases that challenged felon in,3192.01,1.559
possession laws in this country year in,3193.569,1.891
and year out and that is a burden that,3195.46,2.19
petitioner has failed to carry in this,3197.65,1.53
case even the best typos you could make,3199.18,7.11
on that what's he missing justice Elrod,3206.29,4.14
what's missing is a change in his status,3210.43,2.13
as a felon other than him not being,3212.56,3.08
convicted is that that's the only thing,3215.64,2.83
missing and we believe that that is the,3218.47,2.55
key thing that is absent from this case,3221.02,1.86
justice Elrod if there are no further,3222.88,2.16
questions we ask the court to affirm,3225.04,2.61
thank you thank you thank you madam,3227.65,11.34
Chief Justice and may it please the,3238.99,1.29
court,3240.28,0.45
my name is Nick akar and today I will,3240.73,1.95
argue that the aims 3d printed gun,3242.68,2.61
violence prevention Act is,3245.29,1.26
constitutional,3246.55,1.22
your honors today technology enables,3247.77,3.13
individuals to 3d print guns in the,3250.9,2.52
comfort of their own home publishing,3253.42,2.46
these files offers individuals a new,3255.88,2.52
form of gun distribution that,3258.4,1.5
circumvents both state and federal gun,3259.9,2.25
safety we don't permit the banning of,3262.15,2.25
books but teach people how to make bombs,3264.4,4.79
the books don't provide the raw,3269.19,2.35
materials they don't provide the,3271.54,2.97
instruments to make the bombs so they're,3274.51,3.81
not much different than my mind the,3278.32,1.86
diagrams so why is the fact that a CAD,3280.18,5.88
diagram capable of being put into effect,3286.06,4.08
by someone else any different than a,3290.14,2.01
bomb-making book Your Honor we would,3292.15,2.43
argue that these 3d printable gun files,3294.58,2.04
those are regulated by the GV PA the Gun,3296.62,2.91
Violence Prevention Act and aims are not,3299.53,2.1
simple blueprints they are not the,3301.63,2.58
blueprint that tells an individual how,3304.21,1.86
to make a gun,3306.07,0.75
they're the blueprint that actually,3306.82,2.01
makes the gun this is a form of,3308.83,2.88
technology that this court or any court,3311.71,2.34
for that matter has ever countenance,3314.05,1.68
it's a technology that can build an,3315.73,2.7
object and it's in that way it's,3318.43,2.64
important to understand exactly what the,3321.07,2.13
GV PA regulates you see the axe plain,3323.2,2.61
language limits its scope to a subset of,3325.81,2.61
CAD files or computer code those that,3328.42,2.7
can automatically print an operational,3331.12,2.31
gun in other words your honors the GV PA,3333.43,2.4
does not regulate firearm design files,3335.83,3.0
or CAD files that simply depict virtual,3338.83,3.18
guns it only applies to those that can,3342.01,2.7
automatically create and produce an,3344.71,2.67
operational firearm those that are ready,3347.38,1.86
ensure that sounds nice but as I,3349.24,2.91
understand it it can't you just don't,3352.15,3.96
take of CAD,3356.11,3.35
script put it into the computer and the,3359.46,3.3
gun comes out of the computer as I,3362.76,3.6
understand it you have to adjust the,3366.36,3.75
program to a particular preacher you,3370.11,2.97
have to change the printing mechanism to,3373.08,2.25
do the slices and then you have to,3375.33,3.03
provide the raw materials and all sorts,3378.36,2.91
of other steps have to be taken before,3381.27,2.31
the gun produces it doesn't come out of,3383.58,2.43
the cat wholesale Your Honor we would,3386.01,2.73
disagree with that description of the,3388.74,1.41
technology it is true that individuals,3390.15,3.3
might have to put the puzzle pieces of,3393.45,1.62
the gun together or purchase the raw,3395.07,1.44
materials but it is not true that CAD,3396.51,3.45
files with ready instructions encoded,3399.96,2.61
within them can be published on the,3402.57,2.04
internet those files are available and,3404.61,2.13
in fact a domestic abuser names just two,3406.74,2.34
years ago downloaded one of these files,3409.08,2.13
and there's no evidence in the record to,3411.21,1.83
suggest that there was any slicing,3413.04,1.71
needed and in fact well he only as I,3414.75,2.58
understood it used a CAD part in a,3417.33,5.01
completed gun he didn't use the whole,3422.34,2.9
certainly Your Honor I it is possible,3425.24,2.95
for these CAD files to print parts but,3428.19,2.25
the contention here as chief justice,3430.44,2.16
sotomayor you mentioned is that the,3432.6,1.56
files are require a number of steps and,3434.16,3.15
we would disagree with that contention,3437.31,1.38
while they do require some steps there,3438.69,2.31
are CAD files that unlike firearm design,3441.0,3.33
files which do not have instructions to,3444.33,1.65
a 3d printer there are files that do,3445.98,2.4
have instructions to a 3d printer and,3448.38,1.68
would enable a young child or a domestic,3450.06,2.79
user or a felon to very easily print,3452.85,2.82
their very own gun in the comfort of,3455.67,2.1
their own home it still isn't this is a,3457.77,1.47
content-based restriction this is saying,3459.24,2.37
you cannot publish to the Internet,3461.61,2.01
upload files that provide information,3463.62,1.73
that can be accessed and read and,3465.35,3.64
understood by a user albeit with a,3468.99,2.7
functional aspect to it but we don't,3471.69,2.85
like content-based restrictions,3474.54,1.79
generally you have to satisfy strict,3476.33,2.5
scrutiny and you know the record,3478.83,3.3
suggested that such files and,3482.13,4.16
alternative CAD programs and related,3486.29,3.25
programs have been available for quite a,3489.54,1.8
while,3491.34,0.61
that Ames is the only jurisdiction that,3491.95,3.22
is banning their uploading to the,3495.17,1.77
Internet and what I need you to explain,3496.94,3.57
to me why the state is a compelling,3500.51,1.47
interest that is narrowly tailored in,3501.98,2.299
restricting the transfer of this,3504.279,2.621
information in the way that the statute,3506.9,2.04
does certainly your honor I'll adjust,3508.94,2.399
the first part of your question noting,3511.339,2.071
that this might be a content-based,3513.41,1.199
regulation and we would reject that,3514.609,1.47
contention under read a content-based,3516.079,2.341
regulation is content-based if it,3518.42,1.77
regulates based off of the idea or the,3520.19,2.129
message expressed and that's not what,3522.319,1.951
the GV PA does here the gvp a regulation,3524.27,2.759
says don't don't upload a diagram of a,3527.029,6.81
gun how is that not an idea well your,3533.839,4.891
honor under the plain text of the,3538.73,1.139
statute the statute does not say that an,3539.869,2.311
individual cannot upload a diagram of,3542.18,1.98
the gun of a gun it simply indicates,3544.16,2.369
that an individual cannot upload onto,3546.529,2.25
the internet available to the public a,3548.779,2.491
diagram of a gun that can automatically,3551.27,2.67
produce a firearm a diagram that has,3553.94,2.099
instructions that would enable somebody,3556.039,2.31
to automatically print a firearm that,3558.349,1.77
functional component is vitally,3560.119,1.95
important to the narrow tailoring of the,3562.069,1.71
GV PA to justice karna justice karna to,3563.779,2.671
your point and in that way it's,3566.45,2.369
important also to recognize that in,3568.819,2.581
contradiction of petitioners statement,3571.4,1.86
Ames is not the only state to have,3573.26,2.49
prohibited the publishing of these files,3575.75,2.21
New Jersey recently prohibited the,3577.96,2.44
publishing of these 3d printable gun,3580.4,2.01
files and for that matter over the past,3582.41,2.52
five years the publishing of these files,3584.93,2.909
has actually been illegal under a,3587.839,2.28
nationwide injunction presented in the,3590.119,1.831
defense distributed cases that has only,3591.95,1.95
become illegal in August furthermore,3593.9,2.58
since those files have been allowed to,3596.48,3.9
be uploaded legally after the Trump,3600.38,2.699
administration has allowed for them to,3603.079,2.22
be uploaded over 20 states including,3605.299,2.941
California Washington North Carolina and,3608.24,2.339
a number a number of others who,3610.579,2.01
understand that the uploading of these,3612.589,1.77
3d printable gun files poses a threat to,3614.359,2.821
both public safety and got any - are you,3617.18,4.23
agreeing though that we have a,3621.41,1.11
content-based restriction on speed,3622.52,2.5
no your honor why not we don't believe,3625.02,3.03
this is a content-based restriction,3628.05,1.2
because it it regulates based off of the,3629.25,3.12
functionality of the file but but what,3632.37,2.22
the statute says is you may not publish,3634.59,3.15
over the internet digital instructions,3637.74,2.37
in the form of CAD files or other,3640.11,2.31
computer code code is communication,3642.42,3.15
files or communication digital,3645.57,3.0
instructions are communication and it's,3648.57,2.4
a particular kind of instruction or,3650.97,2.64
communication that is regulated here I,3653.61,1.89
don't understand why that is in a,3655.5,1.53
content-based restriction as to which we,3657.03,2.28
apply strict scrutiny well your honor in,3659.31,2.52
the first instance we'd argue that this,3661.83,1.74
speech if it is to be categorized as,3663.57,2.31
speech by this Court should actually be,3665.88,2.07
unprotected by the First Amendment,3667.95,1.62
because it is integral to criminal,3669.57,1.83
conduct under this course jurisprudence,3671.4,1.86
in Gibbon II and thus the content-based,3673.26,1.68
angry need not even come up I'm sorry,3674.94,2.34
what's intricate there is no unless,3677.28,4.02
there's a law and aims that you can't,3681.3,2.37
possess a firearm in your home what's,3683.67,3.39
illegal about having a CAD created gun,3687.06,5.67
in your home your honor under Section,3692.73,3.36
922 D of the Federal firearm statute,3696.09,2.49
there's a restriction on the,3698.58,2.19
indiscriminate distribution of guns to,3700.77,2.28
individuals they cannot legally own them,3703.05,1.74
there's also a restriction across not,3704.79,2.69
that's certain convicted felons can't,3707.48,4.09
own them yes sir a normal unconvicted,3711.57,4.25
person myself sitting in my home can I,3715.82,4.93
own a gun yes your honor I would presume,3720.75,3.51
so if I were to take this CAD program,3724.26,4.56
and create a gun,3728.82,2.31
other than this law would I be breaking,3731.13,3.66
any other law you would not your honor,3734.79,2.76
and we believe that the G V so why is,3737.55,2.07
this an instrumentality of a crime of,3739.62,2.73
criminal conduct it's the person who,3742.35,3.03
uses it illegally who's committing the,3745.38,3.03
crime it's not the program committing,3748.41,2.4
the crime well your honor we believe the,3750.81,2.13
internet is important to distinguish,3752.94,1.59
here because on the internet there are,3754.53,3.21
proximately by our calculations about,3757.74,1.59
one in every four persons are prohibited,3759.33,2.55
from owning a firearm on those who have,3761.88,2.13
access to the Internet and under Federal,3764.01,1.95
Firearms ovulation we have one out of,3765.96,2.28
four Internet users or convicted felons,3768.24,2.61
I know your honor but children are also,3770.85,1.92
prohibited from owning handguns those,3772.77,2.37
handguns that petitioner wishes to put,3775.14,2.49
freely on online and we would argue,3777.63,2.7
what's the source of that statement Oh,3780.33,2.25
your honor,3782.58,0.78
according to recent census data there,3783.36,1.89
are about 75 to 80 million children in,3785.25,2.25
the u.s. who have internet access and,3787.5,1.95
there are a number about 5 to 6 million,3789.45,4.169
felons and that's not even counting,3793.619,2.271
those citizens as whose non-citizens who,3795.89,3.55
are here in the United States who cannot,3799.44,1.23
own a gun so your argument is that,3800.67,1.68
because there are people who are not,3802.35,2.7
allowed we'll just call them bad people,3805.05,1.68
or people who are too young can't have,3806.73,2.85
this that the people lawful people,3809.58,2.28
should be deprived access why is it that,3811.86,2.64
just quintessential over breath Your,3814.5,3.24
Honor we don't think that the lawful,3817.74,1.32
individuals who can own this gun are,3819.06,2.51
deprived of access the gvp a we'd argue,3821.57,3.52
does not is not a total ban on 3d,3825.09,2.85
printable gun files it allows for,3827.94,1.65
private communications and as justice,3829.59,2.07
Elrod you noted it even allows for a,3831.66,2.31
website to be posted and information to,3833.97,2.19
be disseminated to let people know that,3836.16,2.64
if they want these files they can,3838.8,1.41
distribute them privately but not,3840.21,1.74
publicly in an area where children and,3841.95,2.43
felons can download these files at a,3844.38,2.94
whim if they want to and possess a 3d,3847.32,3.9
printable gun well so why isn't it that,3851.22,2.399
you didn't regulate that activity why a,3853.619,4.621
total ban rather than one that says if,3858.24,2.7
you're going to share a file you have to,3860.94,2.85
have that person identify themselves,3863.79,2.3
Your Honor we think in the context of,3866.09,2.5
gun regulations it's important to have,3868.59,2.01
both preventive and remedial measures,3870.6,2.06
this court in the federal federal,3872.66,2.949
firearm regulations have recognized this,3875.609,2.01
not only banning the distribution of,3877.619,2.461
guns generally and also not simply,3880.08,3.029
requiring registration of firearms after,3883.109,2.641
they're given to from a federal firearm,3885.75,2.369
dealer to an individual but they put in,3888.119,1.981
place a federal background,3890.1,1.169
check the GV PA acts like that federal,3891.269,2.46
background check in that it is a,3893.729,1.55
preventative basis speech so if you,3895.279,3.82
can't be you can't chill per protected,3899.099,3.3
speech you have to be left to Taylor,3902.399,2.31
well Your Honor we do believe that this,3904.709,1.71
is narrowly tailored in that it does not,3906.419,1.95
touch all firearm design files it had,3908.369,2.22
touches a specific subset and if this,3910.589,2.31
Court were to grant full speech,3912.899,2.01
protection and thus reject the integral,3914.909,2.19
to criminal conduct argument that we,3917.099,1.71
submit we believe that it would it's,3918.809,2.22
important for the doctrine the First,3921.029,2.31
Amendment doctrine that this Court has,3923.339,1.44
proffered and read that that doctrine be,3924.779,4.26
adapted to deal with the intricacies of,3929.039,2.73
this new technology most of them I have,3931.769,2.371
is that although you're talking to me,3934.14,3.689
about various needs of the state the law,3937.829,3.45
is written isn't even satisfying one of,3941.279,3.03
those needs because is your adversary,3944.309,2.85
correct that someone can put this cat on,3947.159,4.71
a website or offer it and as long as,3951.869,3.0
someone privately emails them for it,3954.869,2.1
they can share it we do believe that,3956.969,2.61
would be allowed under the GV PA your,3959.579,2.4
honor so if it allows that what is the,3961.979,5.79
ban accomplishing your honor the ban is,3967.769,2.4
accomplishing something that occurred,3970.169,1.711
and aims just two years ago and other,3971.88,2.75
other instances where individuals who,3974.63,4.239
would like to have these files at a,3978.869,2.04
moment's notice can get them it also,3980.909,2.04
disables all that gentlemen would have,3982.949,1.86
had to do was to write to the petitioner,3984.809,4.17
and ask him for a copy of the CAD and,3988.979,2.19
that would have been perfectly legal,3991.169,1.32
your honor we think the delay here is,3992.489,2.07
important in the context of gun laws the,3994.559,2.49
narrow tailoring is sufficient here,3997.049,2.25
because it doesn't burden substantially,3999.299,2.46
more speech that is then is necessary,4001.759,2.34
for example the GV PA could have been,4004.099,1.74
written to cover those files without,4005.839,2.041
instructions to a 3d printer but the,4007.88,2.759
aims legislature decided to narrowly,4010.639,1.71
tailored statute so that it wouldn't,4012.349,2.22
confront the issues posed by the First,4014.569,2.01
Amendment doctrine but we do argue that,4016.579,2.58
the First Amendment doctrine needs to be,4019.159,1.56
changed in the context of this new type,4020.719,1.8
of speech if this Court were to grant,4022.519,2.101
protection to 3d printable gun files so,4024.62,2.19
you're saying you can delay what for 48,4026.81,2.34
hours for 72 you can delay speech rights,4029.15,2.82
for a certain time periods we don't,4031.97,1.62
allow the delay of First Amendment,4033.59,3.54
rights for time periods a or other,4037.13,2.13
fundamental rights except under very,4039.26,2.94
limited circumstances certainly Your,4042.2,3.57
Honor this Court made that point clear,4045.77,1.38
in part Nikki stated that there are some,4047.15,2.07
rare occasions in which a law,4049.22,1.95
suppressing one-party speech may be,4051.17,1.86
justified by an interest in deterring,4053.03,2.04
criminal conduct by another and we think,4055.07,2.22
in the context where a file like the 3d,4057.29,4.56
printable gun file that you hear can,4061.85,1.92
automatically produce a firearm that is,4063.77,3.0
the rare scenario that we have here and,4066.77,2.49
for that reason we urge this court to do,4069.26,2.79
what it did in Denver and and carpenter,4072.05,2.43
and adjust its president in the face of,4074.48,1.92
technology that we've never seen before,4076.4,2.1
in Carpinteria this Court stated firmly,4078.5,2.37
that when confronting new concerns,4080.87,2.16
wrought by digital technology,4083.03,1.65
this Court has strayed away from,4084.68,1.44
uncritically applying its prior,4086.12,1.68
precedent and for that reason we urge,4087.8,2.1
this court to understand that this,4089.9,2.58
speech if it is to be categorised speech,4092.48,2.28
is entirely different from any type of,4094.76,2.88
speech that this Court has seen before,4097.64,1.67
but if this court were to move on and,4099.31,2.74
not adapt its precedent in applying,4102.05,1.8
intermediate scrutiny to 3d printable,4103.85,2.009
gun files that are based on the,4105.859,2.011
functionality of the file rather than,4107.87,2.13
the idea our message is expressed we do,4110.0,2.52
think that we need to have produced a,4112.52,1.919
minute please,4114.439,0.63
in assessing whether you've shown a that,4115.069,4.651
this law is necessary given the First,4119.72,1.889
Amendment concerns that my colleagues,4121.609,2.551
have have raised I was struck by the,4124.16,3.36
points made by your adversary about the,4127.52,2.28
easy availability of 80 percent guns,4129.8,3.45
that can be assembled that are basically,4133.25,1.92
sold in a modular fashion and that can,4135.17,2.67
be put together they wouldn't escape,4137.84,3.99
metal detectors I suppose to that extent,4141.83,2.01
they would be somewhat less worrisome,4143.84,2.16
but are readily available at the,4146.0,2.97
circumvent the state of aims,4148.97,1.65
registration system altogether we need,4150.62,2.46
to take that ready availability into,4153.08,2.76
account in assessing the,4155.84,1.629
whether you've shown that this is a,4157.469,2.76
necessary regulation in your overall gun,4160.229,2.969
control approach I don't believe so,4163.198,2.611
justice Carney although there might be,4165.809,2.28
one loophole in Ames's regulatory scheme,4168.089,2.25
that does not permit the allowance of,4170.339,2.581
another loophole the GV PA was enacted,4172.92,2.939
to close one loophole and the aims,4175.859,1.86
legislature much like the New Jersey,4177.719,1.83
Legislature can if it wants closed the,4179.549,3.42
80% receiver loop but but this but this,4182.969,2.85
loophole has First Amendment,4185.819,1.98
implications whereas the other one,4187.799,1.26
doesn't and that's why I'm asking,4189.059,1.29
whether there can be a closer tailoring,4190.349,2.84
there certainly would be required if,4193.189,2.68
this Court were to categorize 3d,4195.869,1.98
printable gun files as speech a need for,4197.849,2.19
closer closer tailoring and we do,4200.039,1.98
believe that the GV PA meets that need,4202.019,1.651
because it is unlike statutes that this,4203.67,2.79
Court has recently struck down as,4206.46,2.279
unconstitutional under both intermediate,4208.739,2.13
and strict scrutiny for example in,4210.869,1.92
packing ham this court noted that the,4212.789,1.741
statute there was vague because it left,4214.53,3.049
sex offenders and those subject to the,4217.579,3.04
statute in purgatory not knowing whether,4220.619,3.75
they could access sites like Amazon or,4224.369,1.681
Facebook here the statute is clear it,4226.05,2.489
cabins its language its plain text to,4228.539,2.58
specific files those with instructions,4231.119,2.4
that can automatically print a firearm,4233.519,1.801
it also allows for alternative methods,4235.32,2.159
of communication through email private,4237.479,2.731
messaging and others those do you lose,4240.21,1.59
if we think this is content-based no,4241.8,3.569
your on each restriction no your honor,4245.369,2.61
we do not assume it is content-based,4247.979,2.31
how do you meet scrutiny well your honor,4250.289,3.48
in the first instance if this is,4253.769,1.381
facially content-based we believe the,4255.15,1.56
secondary effects doctrine can be used,4256.71,2.489
in order to send this regulation we,4259.199,2.371
never use that doctrine outside of adult,4261.57,3.98
businesses and and I'm not quite sure I,4265.55,3.969
understand how we would apply it to this,4269.519,3.151
situation that there is a portion of the,4272.67,2.79
population that might illegally use this,4275.46,3.36
gun there still a portion that won't,4278.82,4.25
certainly so in the secondary effects,4283.07,3.779
content,4286.849,1.361
there's the existence of secondary,4288.21,2.31
effects that actually insist exists that,4290.52,3.48
justify a state regulation but why would,4294.0,4.77
that doctrine apply here I see my time,4298.77,2.46
is expired if your honor would allow I,4301.23,1.65
will answer as quickly as possible we,4302.88,2.25
believe the secondary effects doctrine,4305.13,1.56
is applicable here although it's only,4306.69,1.529
been it's only been used to uphold a,4308.219,2.431
statute in the adult business concept,4310.65,2.46
context it has not been captained to,4313.11,1.53
that area this Court has analyzed,4314.64,2.19
secondary effects under Rav and boos V,4316.83,3.12
Barry and it is exactly necessary here,4319.95,3.03
because the G V P is justified by crime,4322.98,1.89
prevention a secondary effects aimed at,4324.87,3.599
secondary effects like crime prevention,4328.469,1.641
your honor for these reasons we would,4330.11,2.379
urge that this court affirm the lower,4332.489,1.711
court ruling thank you,4334.2,3.11
petitioners you have three minutes of,4337.34,4.87
rebuttal are you addressing both issues,4342.21,7.68
are just your issue yes your honor I,4349.89,1.71
have one point on each issue I would,4351.6,1.98
like to begin with the Second Amendment,4353.58,1.29
issue again before this court the state,4354.87,3.39
does not really make an argument for why,4358.26,2.64
the law the restriction on girls is,4360.9,1.98
right to bear arms would pass strict,4362.88,1.44
scrutiny and to get into intermediate,4364.32,1.919
scrutiny and they rely on this notion,4366.239,1.441
that Heller split the Second Amendment,4367.68,2.22
right into a core and a non core but I,4369.9,2.67
would like to read a brief bit of that,4372.57,2.04
part of Heller at page 66 35 of that,4374.61,2.49
opinion it said that the Second,4377.1,1.71
Amendment is the very product of an,4378.81,1.47
interest balancing by the people and,4380.28,1.53
whatever else it leaves the future,4381.81,1.65
evaluation,4383.46,0.84
it surely evaluates above all sir pardon,4384.3,2.7
me I surely elevates above all other,4387.0,1.86
interests the right of law-abiding,4388.86,1.56
responsible citizens to use arms and,4390.42,2.37
defense of hearth and home and the state,4392.79,2.19
reads this to create a sort of tear or,4394.98,1.739
tranche system who anybody who's not a,4396.719,1.921
law-abiding responsible citizen doesn't,4398.64,2.099
have the full second Amendment right but,4400.739,2.011
in context it's clear Justice Scalia,4402.75,1.56
Justice Scalia was simply responding to,4404.31,1.83
Justice Breyer on the question of,4406.14,1.68
whether the interest of persons like,4407.82,2.01
Heller could be elevated over the,4409.83,1.71
state's constitutional interests so that,4411.54,1.98
says nothing about whether others,4413.52,1.56
interests are similarly diminished as,4415.08,3.51
the state says that it should be here,4418.59,1.8
and in,4420.39,0.7
your adversary is making a slightly,4421.09,5.31
different more nuanced argument his,4426.4,3.089
argument is not that there's a tear in,4429.489,2.21
constitutional rights but that the,4431.699,2.65
source of the state's power comes from a,4434.349,3.33
different source and that the source of,4437.679,3.17
prohibiting felons from possessing,4440.849,2.89
firearms comes from the police source,4443.739,3.141
the First Amendment on the other hand is,4446.88,3.37
not a part of the policing power it's,4450.25,3.06
part of the marketplace of ideas to,4453.31,2.429
which even felons participates because,4455.739,4.051
they contribute and so if you view it,4459.79,3.9
that way how does what remains of your,4463.69,3.509
two-tier argument Your Honor I think I,4467.199,3.601
would disagree that the state's argument,4470.8,1.62
as to the tearing portion really looks,4472.42,2.37
to that felon non felon distinction but,4474.79,2.429
in either event both the state's reading,4477.219,1.561
of Heller and the theory you've,4478.78,1.319
articulated but runs afoul of the,4480.099,3.12
principle this court articulated in,4483.219,1.891
McDonald that the Second Amendment is a,4485.11,1.68
fundamental right and it should not be,4486.79,2.46
treated cannot be treated indeed as a,4489.25,1.949
second class way turning to the First,4491.199,2.311
Amendment point with my remaining time,4493.51,1.56
the state again today as it did in its,4495.07,2.25
papers relies on a narrowing,4497.32,1.47
construction of this statute indeed it,4498.79,2.01
does not defend the constitutionality of,4500.8,1.439
the law beyond that interpretation and,4502.239,2.221
we think that interpretation presents,4504.46,2.04
its own constitutional concerns namely,4506.5,2.55
it would be a real chilling concern the,4509.05,1.98
state would read its statute to regulate,4511.03,2.04
just some computer-aided design files,4513.07,2.069
even though its text plainly,4515.139,1.921
criminalizes and imposes a 5-year jail,4517.06,2.22
sentence on the publication of,4519.28,1.709
computer-aided design files the,4520.989,1.98
regulated community here is we submit in,4522.969,1.741
our reply brief understands that phrase,4524.71,2.07
to be the kind of files that do need,4526.78,1.859
alteration before a 3d printer can,4528.639,1.531
understand them and therefore even the,4530.17,1.739
state's narrowing construction raises,4531.909,1.681
constitutional concerns of its own and,4533.59,1.589
for these reasons we ask that the court,4535.179,1.651
reverse thank you,4536.83,3.44
we are will retire to delivery,4543.39,5.07
[Music],4554.87,3.19
[Music],4588.83,3.23
all rise please have a seat,4627.689,23.43
well before we announce the winners and,4655.02,3.49
I don't know what the normal protocol is,4658.51,2.16
the three of us want to make a few,4660.67,2.46
statements so we figured after we,4663.13,2.76
announce who won the rest of you,4665.89,3.24
wouldn't be interested in sticking,4669.13,1.2
around I said well take advantage well,4670.33,5.1
the last time I was at Ames Finals was,4675.43,3.89
1991 before some of you were born I,4679.32,2.65
guess and this was a bad night for me,4681.97,4.83
because we lost it was a good night in,4686.8,3.03
many many respects and I learned a lot,4689.83,2.37
but we did not win but interestingly,4692.2,3.66
enough we had three judges on our panel,4695.86,3.06
we had justice Souter we had judge Taha,4698.92,4.56
and we had judge Patrick Higginbotham,4703.48,4.47
from the fifth circuit and the reason I,4707.95,2.34
tell you this is that it was a,4710.29,1.74
two-to-one split decision and judge,4712.03,3.0
Patrick Higginbotham wanted it to be,4715.03,2.16
known that he had voted for our team and,4717.19,3.44
which was which was I was happy about,4720.63,3.16
that but what I was really happy was,4723.79,2.81
that in 2007 I was named to succeed,4726.6,5.8
judge Patrick Higginbotham on the 5th,4732.4,3.06
circuit,4735.46,2.6
so I and I get to work with him still,4742.06,3.13
now all the time because he's a very,4745.19,1.86
active judge on our court but I tell you,4747.05,2.85
that so if you lose tonight you could,4749.9,3.0
replace one of us said answer and I and,4752.9,5.04
I hope you do and hope you do well I,4757.94,2.07
want to thank you this you you could all,4760.01,2.79
do this for a living you should know,4762.8,2.04
that and be proud of the work that your,4764.84,2.52
team has done the briefing and the,4767.36,1.95
argument superb the problem is a superb,4769.31,4.05
timely problem it is certainly not moot,4773.36,2.97
in the first sense of the definition and,4776.33,3.75
I want to also express appreciation to,4780.08,2.73
the members of the BSA who worked,4782.81,1.77
tirelessly and a Vaughn Smith who was,4784.58,2.43
working here back when I was here and,4787.01,2.31
has observed our this school for 40,4789.32,2.01
years so thank you,4791.33,2.9
well I did not argue here but I was,4802.219,3.101
intimidated by this room and it's nice,4805.32,3.75
to be sitting on the bench as opposed to,4809.07,1.649
there yet this has been so much fun the,4810.719,4.231
problem was really wonderfully crafted,4814.95,1.71
it had so many interesting issues and,4816.66,2.43
really challenging issues for both sides,4819.09,1.95
I loved reading your briefs and hearing,4821.04,2.429
you tonight you were so poised and ready,4823.469,2.791
to parry with us whatever we threw your,4826.26,2.4
way you didn't lose a beat you responded,4828.66,3.87
you didn't lean on the bench and roll,4832.53,2.34
your eyes at a dumb question you just,4834.87,2.19
were patient and you all did really a,4837.06,3.03
fantastic job and it was really just a,4840.09,1.95
pleasure to be here questioning you and,4842.04,3.81
hearing the the fruits of your very hard,4845.85,3.66
work overtime Harvard Law School is,4849.51,2.85
doing a good job and you're doing a,4852.36,1.29
really good job so congratulations to,4853.65,1.95
you,4855.6,2.119
it's hard enough to do these arguments,4862.86,4.03
when they're real when they're not,4866.89,3.15
McCourt's so you might wonder why do we,4870.04,3.78
do them and we can tell you that we're,4873.82,3.14
altruistic that we don't want to help,4876.96,2.28
our alma mater z' and,4879.24,2.26
help students I admit the truth every,4881.5,6.12
time I come to one of these and I see,4887.62,3.06
the extraordinary performances of the,4890.68,3.36
students at these exercises it fills me,4894.04,4.32
with hope about the future it shows me,4898.36,3.99
that you are being trained to think and,4902.35,3.35
to respond in extraordinarily loyally,4905.7,5.46
professional ways and that you carry in,4911.16,3.61
your hands our future in a really good,4914.77,4.56
way so I come here for you to give me,4919.33,4.02
hope and so it's selfish of me I really,4923.35,6.06
was incredibly impressed with each and,4929.41,2.85
every one of you you were prepared,4932.26,3.33
you knew your case you didn't let us,4935.59,2.58
rattle you you had thought through your,4938.17,4.23
strategy of presentation you stuck to it,4942.4,2.91
you did everything we want a,4945.31,2.13
well-prepared lawyer to do thank you,4947.44,5.93
the hardest part of this exercise for us,4960.37,3.61
is the judging because it's always so,4963.98,4.08
close it's usually a hair apart between,4968.06,4.62
the two teams just like tonight and we,4972.68,3.42
end up voting on little things that most,4976.1,3.06
people in the audience would really,4979.16,2.28
rightly call insignificant but when you,4981.44,3.66
have two so evenly matched teams you got,4985.1,4.08
to break the tie somehow and so we found,4989.18,3.57
little things to break it on but I do,4992.75,2.73
want to say that it wasn't from a lack,4995.48,3.15
of superb performance by each and every,4998.63,3.24
one of you having said that it was,5001.87,5.34
interesting this exercise it was and,5007.21,3.81
what I found so wonderful about it is,5011.02,2.82
these are cases that are going to come,5013.84,2.1
through the courts,5015.94,0.99
they are wending their way through the,5016.93,2.46
courts right now the first issue on on,5019.39,5.37
these CAD designs as one of you pointed,5024.76,4.08
out new jersey has a similar law and,5028.84,3.15
that's already in the courts with,5031.99,3.6
respect to the second issue it was one,5035.59,3.03
that was raised by a cert petition if,5038.62,2.28
not a year two years ago and so it's,5040.9,3.81
down there percolating whether the fact,5044.71,3.72
scenario that arises before us will be,5048.43,2.55
identical to yours or not I don't know,5050.98,3.17
but each side had stronger arguments on,5054.15,6.1
one question weaker arguments on another,5060.25,2.39
and it was a really well-done exercise,5062.64,3.99
having said all of that please remember,5066.63,3.07
that by choosing a winner of each,5069.7,3.57
category it should mean nothing to the,5073.27,3.03
person we haven't chosen you perform,5076.3,2.88
just as well the difference was a slice,5079.18,6.41
I couldn't help that best arles Matt,5087.79,7.86
Scott ciao,5095.65,2.839
best brief petitioner the grace Murray,5111.57,3.55
hopper memorial team,5115.12,3.41
and best team overall petitioner,5124.33,5.39
I echo my thanks to all of the Eames,5144.489,5.271
teammates who worked so hard to put this,5149.76,3.669
together to all the faculty and judges,5153.429,3.54
who were a part of the various stages of,5156.969,2.67
the competition to all the participants,5159.639,3.11
this kind of teamwork is something that,5162.749,2.95
stays with you for life,5165.699,1.5
judge Elrod told you her story but she's,5167.199,3.781
absolutely right those who weren't,5170.98,2.909
chosen tonight will be sitting in very,5173.889,3.781
important positions some day and,5177.67,2.099
remember her story thank you all for a,5179.769,3.211
wonderful evening,5182.98,2.57
you,5209.03,2.06
you,5216.87,2.06
