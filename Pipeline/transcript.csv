"and I, along with myco-counsel Mr. Al Kelly,",228.52,3.57

"I will be addressing theequal protection issue,",235.81,2.29
and Mr. Kelly will be addressingthe anti-commandeering issue.,238.1,3.89
We would like to reservethree minutes for rebuttal.,241.99,4.59
The federal government'srelationship with Indian tribes,246.58,2.75
is premised on an understandingenshrined in the Constitution,249.33,4.02
that Indian tribesconstitute a political class.,253.35,3.929
This understandingserves as the principle,257.279,2.131
underlying allfederal legislation,259.41,2.04
governing Indian Affairs.,261.45,2.13
At issue today is onesuch piece of legislation.,263.58,3.39
"The Indian ChildWelfare Act, or ICWA.",266.97,3.81
"This Court reviewslegislation, like ICWA,",270.78,2.73
that is directed atthose who are politically,273.51,1.92
affiliated with federallyrecognized tribes,275.43,2.82
under the standard establishedin Morton V Mancari.,278.25,3.56
The Mancari testupholds such legislation,281.81,2.66
as long as it canbe tied rationally,284.47,2.04
to Congress's uniqueobligation toward Indians.,286.51,3.48
ICWA satisfies the Mancari test.,289.99,2.49
It is directed only atthose who are politically,292.48,2.34
"affiliated with federallyrecognized tribes, and is--",294.82,3.103
AMUL THAPAR: Can you--,297.923,0.917
I'm sorry to interruptyou-- but can,298.84,1.5
you explain to us what theymean by political in that case?,300.34,3.887
"MCKAYLA GILBERT-LURIE:Absolutely, Justice Thapar.",304.227,2.083
So a political affiliation witha federally recognized tribe,306.31,3.96
"is what this Courthas always understood,",310.27,2.22
"and what is enshrinedin the Constitution,",312.49,2.58
as a relationship witha political entity that,315.07,3.0
has a sovereign tosovereign relationship,318.07,2.64
"with the federal government, andIndian tribes-- at least those",320.71,3.84
which are federally recognizedby the United States,324.55,3.24
government-- dohave the sovereign,327.79,1.68
to sovereign relationship.,329.47,1.83
And ICWA contains twodefinitions of an Indian child.,331.3,3.9
There are two ways that a childcan qualify as an Indian child,335.2,3.72
for the purposes of ICWA.,338.92,2.04
"First, a child canqualify as an Indian child",340.96,2.91
by being an enrolled member ofa federally recognized tribe.,343.87,3.35
And this definitionfalls squarely,347.22,2.83
"within the Mancaridefinition, and respondents",350.05,2.49
don't contest that thisdefinition of Indian child,352.54,3.55
falls--,356.09,0.5
AMUL THAPAR: The problemis right-- the second part.,356.59,2.312
That's where they take issue?,358.902,1.208
"MCKAYLA GILBERT-LURIE:Yes, Justice Thapar.",360.11,1.792
"If there is a problem, it wouldbe with the second definition.",361.902,2.618
"And the second definitionallows children,",364.52,2.36
"who are the biological childrenof enrolled tribe members, who",366.88,4.08
"are themselves eligiblefor tribal enrollment,",370.96,2.31
to be covered by ICWA.,373.27,1.52
But this definitiondoes not change the fact,374.79,2.59
that Mancari is theappropriate standard,377.38,2.07
under which to review ICWA.,379.45,1.905
MICHELLE FRIEDLAND: Butthis child in this case,381.355,2.325
"was not a member of thetribe, and hadn't even",383.68,2.94
had contact with the parentwho was a member of a tribe.,386.62,3.99
So how is that a politicalconnection instead of a blood,390.61,2.94
connection at that point?,393.55,1.458
The only connection is throughthe blood of the father.,395.008,2.292
Right?,397.3,0.56
"MCKAYLA GILBERT-LURIE:Well, respectfully,",397.86,1.25
"Justice Friedland,we would disagree",399.11,1.5
with that characterization.,400.61,1.29
"CJ, in this case, hasa political affiliation",401.9,3.35
with the [INAUDIBLE] nation.,405.25,1.48
And that's because CJ is thechild of an enrolled member,406.73,3.29
of [INAUDIBLE] nation.,410.02,1.08
And it's useful tothink about membership,411.1,2.4
in a federally recognized tribeas analogous to citizenship.,413.5,3.86
And in much the same way thatthe United States government,417.36,3.04
grants to grant citizenship tothe children of United States,420.4,3.72
"citizens who are born abroad,federally recognized tribes",424.12,3.54
"impute onto the childrenof their members,",427.66,2.07
a political affiliationwith that tribe.,429.73,2.07
And it's thatpolitical affiliation.,431.8,1.545
AMUL THAPAR: So how--,433.345,1.095
I'm sorry.,434.44,0.525
"MICHELLE FRIEDLAND: I wasjust going to ask, how",434.965,1.245
do you get to another tribe?,436.21,1.68
Because it was actuallya different tribe,437.89,2.01
that expressed aninterest in this child.,439.9,2.49
And I have an easier timeseeing what the rationale could,442.39,3.48
be for helping the child becomea member of his or her parent's,445.87,3.63
"tribe, rather thansome other tribe.",449.5,1.905
MCKAYLA GILBERT-LURIE:Certainly.,451.405,1.375
So the fact thatICWA allows children,452.78,2.51
to be placed withmembers of another tribe,455.29,2.13
speaks to Congress'sconcern when,457.42,2.58
"they were passing ICWAin 1978, that children",460.0,3.9
"were being removed not onlyfrom their tribes and families,",463.9,2.64
but from Indianculture more generally.,466.54,2.41
And it was this concern that--,468.95,2.48
"MERRICK GARLAND: Sohow is that, though,",471.43,2.37
political rather than racial?,473.8,2.06
"That is, if the child has noconnection to the other tribe.",475.86,6.31
I understand the argumentyou're making about the tribe,482.17,3.21
"that his father's from,but for the other tribe,",485.38,2.43
there is no connection.,487.81,1.95
Why is this political?,489.76,1.303
"MCKAYLA GILBERT-LURIE:Well, Your Honor,",491.063,1.667
"because CJ, or a given child,has a political affiliation",492.73,4.08
"with a tribe, that child, thus,has a political affiliation",496.81,4.65
to Indian culture.,501.46,1.77
"And Congress sought to correctthe devastating consequences,",503.23,3.36
and the psychologicalharm to children--,506.59,1.83
MERRICK GARLAND: Isthe United States',508.42,1.583
relationship with Indian tribesindividually or with anyone,510.003,4.656
who is an Indian?,514.659,1.681
That is the politicalrelationship.,516.34,1.739
"MCKAYLA GILBERT-LURIE:Well, Your Honor,",518.079,1.667
it's a politicalaffiliation with both tribes,519.746,2.354
"and with children-- or rather--with members of tribes,",522.1,3.09
so it's both an individualand a collective,525.19,2.13
political affiliation.,527.32,1.2
But it's not apolitical affiliation,528.52,2.25
"with all who identifyas Indian, and that's",530.77,2.91
because membership in afederally recognized tribe,533.68,2.94
is distinct from identifying asan Indian or a Native American.,536.62,4.32
The two don't mapon to one another.,540.94,2.41
"There are 5.2 million peoplein this country, at least",543.35,2.99
"according to themost recent census,",546.34,2.37
that identify as AmericanIndian or Alaskan Native.,548.71,2.72
"MICHELLE FRIEDLAND: But they'renot all of the same culture,",551.43,2.96
are they?,554.39,0.5
So you were juststarting to talk,554.89,1.41
"about the legislativehistory, and you talk about",556.3,2.19
in your brief aswell that Congress,558.49,2.25
was trying to remedythe harms of removing,560.74,2.67
"Indian children fromquote ""Indian society"",",563.41,2.95
but is there any suchthing as Indian society?,566.36,2.33
Or is that just a stereotype?,568.69,1.29
It seems like there aremany different tribes,569.98,2.01
with many different cultures.,571.99,1.703
"MCKAYLA GILBERT-LURIE:Justice Friedland, it's true.",573.693,2.167
"Tribes do haveindividual cultures,",575.86,2.16
and they are distinctpolitical entities.,578.02,2.01
But we would suggestthat this Court look,580.03,3.12
"to the amicus brief filedjust this year, in the Fifth",583.15,3.69
Circuit the 325 tribes--,586.84,2.79
federally recognized tribes--who filed an amicus brief,589.63,2.97
"in Bracheen v Burnhardt, whoall evinced their understanding",592.6,3.6
"that ICWA does serve to protectIndian children and tribes,",596.2,3.69
"even with this thirdplacement, that",599.89,1.77
"allows children tobe placed in a tribe,",601.66,2.76
even if it's not thetribe they were born into.,604.42,3.01
And that's because this thirdpreference allows for children,607.43,3.29
"to be placed with other Indianfamilies, if, for example--",610.72,2.485
AMUL THAPAR: Doesn't that--,613.205,1.125
Doesn't that changeyou when you add,614.33,2.33
"in the thirdpreference, any tribe,",616.66,2.55
aren't you evisceratingthe political distinction,619.21,3.27
and really making ita racial distinction?,622.48,2.007
"MCKAYLA GILBERT-LURIE: I don'tthink so, Justice Thapar.",624.487,2.333
And that's becausethese children only,626.82,2.5
have a political affiliationwith Indian culture,629.32,2.97
at all because they are thechildren of members of tribes.,632.29,4.2
And those members havea political affiliation,636.49,2.34
with the tribe.,638.83,0.66
And this Court has alwaysunderstood this relationship,639.49,2.91
to be a political one.,642.4,1.2
"And starting with Mancari, andall the way through until 2005,",643.6,4.71
"with Rice, this Courthas always understood",648.31,1.83
that to be a fundamentallypolitical class indication.,650.14,2.47
AMUL THAPAR: So can the tribesdefine who their members,652.61,4.13
are any way they want?,656.74,1.388
"MCKAYLA GILBERT-LURIE:Yes, Justice Thapar.",658.128,1.792
This Court--,659.92,0.67
AMUL THAPAR: Sowhat if they were,660.59,1.375
like racially discriminatoryin defining the definition,661.965,3.685
of the tribal members.,665.65,1.02
"Saying anyone with even onedrop of Asian, or Black blood,",666.67,4.47
can't be a member.,671.14,2.04
"Then, would you still say itwas political in nature, and OK?",673.18,3.113
"MCKAYLA GILBERT-LURIE: Well, twopoints on that, Justice Thapar.",676.293,2.667
"First, yes, tribes, accordingto this Court in Santa Clara",678.96,3.16
"Pueblo v Martinez,are authorized",682.12,2.46
to have complete authority todefine their own membership.,684.58,2.64
But the second point isthat Congress need not,687.22,2.46
recognize all of these tribes.,689.68,1.8
So if a tribe did define itsmembership in a way that was,691.48,3.66
anathema to Congress'sunderstanding of what a tribe,695.14,2.528
should be-- or at leastwhat the government,697.668,1.792
should recognize as a tribe--,699.46,1.515
"AMUL THAPAR: But ifCongress recognized them,",700.975,1.875
"you'd say that then,we would have to allow",702.85,2.49
racially discriminatory tribes?,705.34,1.357
"MCKAYLA GILBERT-LURIE:No, Your Honor,",706.697,1.583
"that would present amuch closer question,",708.28,1.89
and would be the kindof classification,710.17,1.71
that this Court might reviewunder strict scrutiny.,711.88,2.2
But that's not the casewe have before us today.,714.08,2.33
AMUL THAPAR: So I'm sorryto take you on this tangent.,716.41,2.85
"But explain why then itwould be strict scrutiny,",719.26,2.64
and a nonpoliticalclassification?,721.9,2.7
We can look at--,724.6,0.983
"is what you'resaying, we can look",725.583,1.417
at how tribesdefine their members,727.0,3.21
to decide if it's a politicalclassification or a racial one?,730.21,3.383
"MCKAYLA GILBERT-LURIE:Yes, Justice Thapar,",733.593,1.792
"if a tribe did define itsmembership in a racial way,",735.385,3.975
then that could be thekind of classification--,739.36,2.34
even though it would be apolitical classification--,741.7,2.52
"if it had a racialelement as well,",744.22,2.38
it would be a much closerquestion of the kind,746.6,2.0
that this Court would reviewunder strict scrutiny.,748.6,1.86
MICHELLE FRIEDLAND:But don't many tribes,750.46,1.708
have some blood requirements?,752.168,2.442
So they do have a racialpart of the definition,754.61,2.66
of their tribal membership?,757.27,1.125
"MCKAYLA GILBERT-LURIE: JusticeFriedland, many tribes have",758.395,2.417
a blood quantum requirement.,760.812,1.318
"And the two tribes at issuetoday, the [INAUDIBLE]----",762.13,2.07
"MERRICK GARLAND:It seems for that,",764.2,1.458
"we need Elizabeth Holmes, ratherthan Oliver Wendell Holmes.",765.658,4.592
What do you meanby a blood quantum?,770.25,2.17
And what is the test that[INAUDIBLE] developed for this?,772.42,3.313
"MCKAYLA GILBERT-LURIE:Mr Chief Justice,",775.733,1.667
"we would not need touse-- and thankfully,",777.4,2.1
we would not need touse-- any sort of--,779.5,1.9
[INTERPOSING VOICES],781.4,1.19
MCKAYLA GILBERT-LURIE: --here.,782.59,1.25
And that's becauseblood quantum doesn't,783.84,1.87
"refer to any sort of DNA test,or any sort of blood test",785.71,3.49
at all.,789.2,0.5
It merely refers to thenumber of generations removed,789.7,4.08
that an individual is fromsomeone whose name is listed,793.78,2.7
on an original tribal roll.,796.48,2.4
"It has no bloodrequirement, even though it",798.88,3.36
"might sound like asignifier of race,",802.24,1.957
this Court has alwaysunderstood blood quantum.,804.197,1.958
"MERRICK GARLAND: Soeven if you're right,",806.155,1.708
"that it's political,and we apply Mancari,",807.863,2.867
it still has to be rational.,810.73,1.65
"So what's rational aboutsending a child, who",812.38,3.24
"lives in Ames, for example,to Washington state,",815.62,4.98
to a tribe of whichthe child could never,820.6,2.55
"be a member, oversomeone closer,",823.15,4.02
someone who has morerelationships with the tribe.,827.17,4.17
How is this rational?,831.34,2.34
Even if we agree thatrational basis is the test.,833.68,2.553
"MCKAYLA GILBERT-LURIE:Well, Your Honor,",836.233,1.667
in creating federalminimum standards,837.9,2.35
"for the removal of Indianchildren from their families,",840.25,3.54
ICWA ensures that childrendo remain enmeshed,843.79,4.2
in their tribal culture.,847.99,1.39
MERRICK GARLAND: It'sa different truck.,849.38,2.125
The hypothesis is it'snot their tribal culture.,851.505,4.635
"It's a completely differenttribe across the country,",856.14,3.48
"and they cannot ever becomea member of that tribe,",859.62,2.55
because they have no ancestral--ancestors from the tribe.,862.17,2.927
"MCKAYLA GILBERT-LURIE:Certainly, Justice, chief--",865.097,2.083
Mr. Chief Justice.,867.18,0.96
"In this case, thechild would still",868.14,1.83
have a politicalconnection to that tribe.,869.97,3.968
MERRICK GARLAND: I getthe political point.,873.938,1.792
"Now, I'm moving on tohow is it rational.",875.73,1.873
"MCKAYLA GILBERT-LURIE:Well, Your Honor.",877.603,1.667
MERRICK GARLAND: Political justgets you to what the test is.,879.27,1.8
Right?,881.07,0.66
Now we have to see whetherthis is a reasonable thing,881.73,2.61
for Congress to have done.,884.34,1.138
MCKAYLA GILBERT-LURIE:It's rational.,885.478,1.542
"And, so far, is thatit allows for children",887.02,2.54

"even if we consider it apolitical type of relationship,",1039.069,3.241
why would there be arationality in sending,1042.31,2.25
a child to a different tribe?,1044.56,1.924
MCKAYLA GILBERT-LURIE:Certainly.,1046.484,1.375
"So a child who has a politicalconnection with one tribe,",1047.859,4.381
and would necessarily be apart of this larger culture,1052.24,7.1
"that this Court inMancari, and in Holyfield",1059.34,3.6
subsequently understoodwas one of the reasons,1062.94,3.24
that ICWA was passed.,1066.18,2.0
"In Holyfield, thisCourt made clear",1068.18,2.26
"that Congress sought, in part,to allow for children to remain",1070.44,4.71
a part of their tribal culture.,1075.15,1.77
"And, in sounderstanding, this Court",1076.92,2.91
has acknowledged whatCongress made clear,1079.83,2.1
"in its 1978 report accompanyingthe passage of ICWA, which",1081.93,3.42
is that children sufferpsychological harm when they,1085.35,5.71
"are removed not onlyfrom their own tribe,",1091.06,2.12
but from Indianculture more generally.,1093.18,2.46
And while respondentsmight take--,1095.64,1.507
[INTERPOSING VOICES],1097.147,0.833
AMUL THAPAR: But wouldn'tthey suffer the same way,1097.98,2.31
"being moved across thecountry, versus right",1100.29,3.09
next to their tribein a familiar area?,1103.38,2.64
"And especially, if they hadnever been a part of the tribe?",1106.02,3.43
"MCKAYLA GILBERT-LURIE:Perhaps, Justice Thapar,",1109.45,2.21
but Congressdetermined that it was,1111.66,2.28
in the Indianchild's best interest,1113.94,3.57
to remain in theTribal Community.,1117.51,3.312
AMUL THAPAR: Do we haveto defer to that finding?,1120.822,2.798
"MCKAYLA GILBERT-LURIE:No, Justice Thapar.",1123.62,1.81
So this Court made clear inthe United States versus Sioux,1125.43,2.55
Nation that this Court neednot take Congress at its word,1127.98,2.88
"that its legislation servesthe best interests of tribes,",1130.86,4.41
or advances their interests.,1135.27,1.51
"However, this Court canlook to external evidence",1136.78,2.9
"to confirm thatthis does, in fact,",1139.68,1.65
serve Congress's interests.,1141.33,1.98
"Or rather, that this doesn'tserve tribes interests.",1143.31,2.9
"And one example of thisis as recently as 2016,",1146.21,3.67
the Bureau of IndianAffairs promulgated,1149.88,2.07
a rule that implemented it.,1151.95,3.19
"Where that's the finalrule, and in that rule,",1155.14,3.0
it evinced the intent of atleast the leading government,1158.14,2.78
"agency with respect to IndianAffairs, that ICWA does,",1160.92,3.51
"in fact, serve the purposethat it was intended to serve.",1164.43,3.87
And that Congress was correctthat these three preferences,1168.3,3.45
are rationally tied--,1171.75,1.18
"MICHELLE FRIEDLAND: So theState Family Court, though,",1172.93,2.25
thought that thischild's best interest was,1175.18,2.54
to stay with the Caldwell's.,1177.72,1.29
Right?,1179.01,0.675
"MCKAYLA GILBERT-LURIE: Notexactly, Justice Friedland.",1179.685,2.25
"So the FamilyCourt, in this case,",1181.935,2.295
denied the Caldwell's adoptionpetition in order to--,1184.23,3.442
MICHELLE FRIEDLAND: But inorder to comply with ICWA.,1187.672,2.208
Right?,1189.88,0.56
"I thought the premise was thatotherwise, they would have--",1190.44,3.12
the Court would have giventhe child to the Caldwell's?,1193.56,2.37
"MCKAYLA GILBERT-LURIE:It's not clear, Your Honor.",1195.93,1.77
"And I want to hew closelyto the record on this issue,",1197.7,2.29
but it's not clearthat the Family,1199.99,1.417
Court did determine that.,1201.407,1.423
"Instead, they determinedthat the Caldwell's were not,",1202.83,3.18
"in any way, notfit to be parents.",1206.01,3.02
But the--,1209.03,0.5
MERRICK GARLAND: Ithought it was a burden,1209.53,1.75
"of proof question, a burden--",1211.28,1.27
"MCKAYLA GILBERT-LURIE:Well, certainly.",1212.55,1.08
MERRICK GARLAND: It didn'tsatisfy the burden of proof.,1213.63,1.17
MCKAYLA GILBERT-LURIE: Exactly.,1214.8,1.47
Mr. Chief Justice.,1216.27,0.96
What the FamilyCourt did determine,1217.23,1.77
was that the Caldwell'sdid not present,1219.0,1.68
clear and compelling evidence--,1220.68,2.25
that the Caldwell's submittedsufficient justification,1222.93,5.31
to deviate for a good cause.,1228.24,1.93
And so it's not clearthat they thought,1230.17,1.91
"the Caldwell's were, in fact,the appropriate parents.",1232.08,3.48
But rather thatfollowing ICWA's dictates,1235.56,1.95
"was more appropriatein this case, which--",1237.51,2.34
"MICHELLE FRIEDLAND: So ifthe Family Court had said,",1239.85,2.88
the best interestsof the child was,1242.73,2.46
"to stay with theCaldwell's, do you",1245.19,2.01
think that that would havenecessarily been erroneous?,1247.2,2.778
Is your argument that it'sactually in the child's best,1249.978,2.292
interest to be with a tribe?,1252.27,1.89
"An argument that wouldsay, really, a Court",1254.16,2.52
couldn't reasonably find that?,1256.68,1.725
"MCKAYLA GILBERT-LURIE:No, Justice Friedland.",1258.405,1.875
So this is where thegood cause exception,1260.28,2.85
is particularly important.,1263.13,1.41
And it ensures thatICWA is really as narrow,1264.54,3.12
"as it can be in providingprotection to Indian children,",1267.66,3.557
"parents, and tribes.",1271.217,0.833
And the good causeprovision allows for Courts,1272.05,3.08
to deviate from ICWA'sprovisions for good cause.,1275.13,3.15
"And the Bureau of IndianAffairs, in its recent rule",1278.28,2.73
promulgated fornonexhaustive factors,1281.01,2.34
that Courts areauthorized to consider,1283.35,1.71
in determining good cause.,1285.06,1.18
"So if the lowercourt had, in fact,",1286.24,1.662
determined that therewas sufficient evidence--,1287.902,1.958
MERRICK GARLAND:Could the good clause,1289.86,1.583
include that it's too far away?,1291.443,2.027
"It's at another tribe,but it's too far away,",1293.47,2.52
or it's a tribe that theycan't be a member of?,1295.99,2.105
Or anything like That,1298.095,0.875
"MCKAYLA GILBERT-LURIE:Well, Chief Justice Garland,",1298.97,2.125
that's not one ofthe four factors,1301.095,2.325
that is explicitly listed.,1303.42,1.38
"Those four factors include theopinion of a biological parent,",1304.8,3.57
"the opinion of the child, ifhe or she is of sufficient age",1308.37,3.33
"and capacity to have heropinion taken into account,",1311.7,3.12
"the extreme emotional, physical,or mental needs of the child,",1314.82,4.645
or the presence ofa sibling attachment,1319.465,1.625
that can only be maintainedthrough a certain placement.,1321.09,2.52
But the factorsare nonexhaustive.,1323.61,2.1
So that's not to say thatphysical distance couldn't,1325.71,2.7
create a mentalneed for the child,1328.41,3.21
to stay with a given family.,1331.62,1.23
It's just the--,1332.85,0.625
MICHELLE FRIEDLAND: I noticedthat the regulations say that,1333.475,3.785
attachment that flowed fromtime spent with a non preferred,1337.26,3.63
placement cannot be considered.,1340.89,2.07
Was this anonpreferred placement?,1342.96,1.78
Did this placement violate ICWA?,1344.74,1.523
"MCKAYLA GILBERT-LURIE:Yes, Justice Friedland.",1346.263,1.917
This was anonpreferred placement.,1348.18,1.417
MICHELLE FRIEDLAND: Meaningeven the foster care.,1349.597,2.041
So there wasessentially a mistake,1351.638,1.432
in putting this child with theCaldwell's in the first place?,1353.07,2.31
"MCKAYLA GILBERT-LURIE:Exactly, Justice Friedland.",1355.38,2.083
There was a mistake becausethe Child and Family Services,1357.463,2.757
was not aware that CJ hada tribal affiliation--,1360.22,3.18
or the politicalrelationship with the tribe--,1363.4,2.49
"until the Caldwell'spetition to adopt,",1365.89,2.28
and the Court becameaware of CJ's status.,1368.17,5.86
And this Court hasnever before held,1374.03,2.63
that a statute thatclassifies based,1376.66,2.31
on political affiliation witha federally recognized tribe,1378.97,2.79
violates equal protection.,1381.76,1.47
And it should not do sofor the first time today.,1383.23,3.72
"For the foregoingreasons, we respectfully",1386.95,1.89
ask that this Court reverse.,1388.84,1.32
Thank you.,1390.16,1.212
MERRICK GARLAND: Good rebbutal.,1391.372,1.418
[CROWD CHEERS],1392.79,3.472
"All right, we're goingto be easier on you.",1423.724,1.841
AL KELLEY: Thank you.,1425.565,0.875
"Mr. Chief Justice, andmay it please the Court.",1429.05,2.88
The anti-commandeeringdoctrine stands,1431.93,2.19
for the fundamentalnotion that Congress,1434.12,2.22
"must direct legislationat private actors,",1436.34,2.94
rather than at states.,1439.28,1.8
ICWA does not violatethis clear rule.,1441.08,2.67
The Act confers rights onindividuals and tribes involved,1443.75,3.66
in child welfare proceedings.,1447.41,2.16
"Accordingly, underthe Supremacy Clause,",1449.57,2.13
states must respectthese rights.,1451.7,2.25
And insofar asICWA's provisioned,1453.95,1.77
"of rights affectsstate actors, it",1455.72,1.92
"does so as a statuteof general application,",1457.64,3.21
not as a law directedat the states.,1460.85,3.05
The parties here agree thatthe appropriate framework,1463.9,2.29
under which to analyze thisanti-commandeering challenge,1466.19,2.58
comes from this Court'sopinion last year in Murphy.,1468.77,3.12
"In Murphy, the Courtlaid out a two part test",1471.89,2.37
to determine whethera statute constitutes,1474.26,2.88
"impermissible commandeeringof the state's,",1477.14,2.07
or valid preemptionof state law.,1479.21,2.76
"First, the Court looks towhether a statute represents",1481.97,3.09
the valid exercise of one ofCongress's enumerated powers.,1485.06,4.09
And then the Court asks whetherthat statute is best read,1489.15,2.72
as regulating private actors.,1491.87,2.18
ICWA satisfies bothprongs of this test.,1494.05,2.17
MICHELLE FRIEDLAND: On yourprivate actors argument.,1496.22,2.22
So are you arguing that ICWAregulates private actors,1498.44,4.83
at the sense ofthe families whose,1503.27,2.22
relationships are affected?,1505.49,1.23
Or is your argument thatthere are private adoption,1506.72,2.79
agencies who are regulated?,1509.51,1.923
"AL KELLEY: Both, Your Honor.",1511.433,1.167
So ICWA is best referred asregulating private actors,1512.6,3.42
for two primary reasons.,1516.02,1.54
The first is that itserves to confer rights,1517.56,3.35
"on private actors, Indianchildren, parents, and tribes",1520.91,3.39
involved in these proceedings.,1524.3,1.87
And the second isthat the statute,1526.17,1.49
is of general application.,1527.66,1.59
So it applies withequal force to,1529.25,2.49
both public and private actors.,1531.74,1.74
"So states involved inthese proceedings, as well",1533.48,2.52
"as individuals, such as theCaldwell's, and perhaps,",1536.0,3.195
private adoption or foster.,1539.195,1.125
AMUL THAPAR: What aboutwhen it requires states,1540.32,1.958
to keep records and the like?,1542.278,2.482
Isn't it requiring statesto affirmatively do,1544.76,3.84
certain things?,1548.6,1.26
AL KELLEY: So the recordkeeping requirement,1549.86,2.13
is best read as securingone of the rights,1551.99,2.85
that ICWA conferson private actors.,1554.84,2.08
"And that's the rightconferred in Section 1917,",1556.92,3.02
for an adoptedIndian child to learn,1559.94,3.0
of their tribal affiliationthrough Court records.,1562.94,2.73
And the only way forthis right to be secured,1565.67,2.37
is by requiring thatstate courts maintain,1568.04,2.46
records in Section 1951.,1570.5,2.37
"So that's still best read asregulating private actors,",1572.87,2.94
because it servesto confer a right.,1575.81,2.25
And ICWA provides anumber of other rights,1578.06,2.16
"to tribes, in theform of the ability",1580.22,2.04
"to intervene inproceedings, and parents,",1582.26,2.98
and all of theseprovisions are best,1585.24,1.52
"read as regulatingprivate actors,",1586.76,2.04
not as directing the states.,1588.8,1.44
MERRICK GARLAND: I'm puzzledby one aspect of your brief,1590.24,2.73
where you appear toinsist that the placement,1592.97,2.85
preferences are proceduralrather than substantive.,1595.82,5.21
I have two questions.,1601.03,1.13
"One, why is that so?",1602.16,1.52
"And two, why does that help you?",1603.68,2.15
AL KELLEY: So takingthose questions in turn.,1605.83,2.27
"First, we arguethat these are best",1608.1,2.09
understood as rightsthat are secured,1610.19,1.98
through procedural guarantees.,1612.17,1.73
So we didn't mean toindicate that this,1613.9,2.32
is procedural versussubstantive for eerie purposes.,1616.22,4.06
"And as this Court discussed injinx, it's indeed in this area,",1620.28,3.15
hard to draw any distinctline between procedural,1623.43,4.04
and substantive mandates.,1627.47,1.44
So we merely meant topoint out that they're,1628.91,2.49
procedural guaranteesthat ensure these rights.,1631.4,2.535
MERRICK GARLAND:What's the right?,1633.935,1.731
AL KELLEY: The right is--,1635.666,1.692
depending on the provision--,1637.358,1.167
MERRICK GARLAND: Withrespect to the preference.,1638.525,2.0
I assume the right isa substantive right,1640.525,2.395
"to not be removedto a family, other",1642.92,3.27
than one of the preferences.,1646.19,1.725
"AL KELLEY: Yes, so--",1647.915,0.855
MERRICK GARLAND: That'sa substantive right.,1648.77,0.99
AL KELLEY: That's asubstantive right.,1649.76,1.583
"And as Congress noted,in passing ICWA,",1651.343,3.047
it found that Indianchildren suffer harms,1654.39,4.49
from being placed outside oftheir tribe and their culture.,1658.88,3.07
And so the right vestedin Indian children,1661.95,2.39
through theplacement preferences,1664.34,1.44
is to be able to growup within one's culture.,1665.78,3.6
And the rights thatare given to try--,1669.38,1.95
MICHELLE FRIEDLAND:Are the findings,1671.33,1.5
"that the children suffer,or that the tribe suffers?",1672.83,4.143
"AL KELLEY: Both, Your Honor.",1676.973,1.167
"So Congress, in passing ICWA,found that children suffer",1678.14,4.17
serious psychological harms.,1682.31,1.83
But it also foundthat tribes were--,1684.14,2.79
their ability to continueas self-governing entities,1686.93,2.52
was being threatenedby the removal,1689.45,2.19
of so many current and potentialmembers from their ranks.,1691.64,3.15
So it's a right vestedin both parties.,1694.79,3.18
And the respondents don'tcontest that it was--,1697.97,3.648
"AMUL THAPAR: I'mpuzzled, why doesn't",1701.618,1.542
the state have an interest?,1703.16,1.26
"If you have a child who's nota member of an Indian tribe,",1704.42,3.82
why wouldn't thestate have an interest,1708.24,2.49
"at that point that wasequal to, if not greater,",1710.73,2.82
than the Indian tribes?,1713.55,2.33
"AL KELLEY: Well, Congressmade the determination",1715.88,2.0
when weighing therelative interests there,1717.88,2.46
to apply federal lawthat gave greater,1720.34,3.63
"weight to the protection ofthese Indian children, parents,",1723.97,2.88
and tribes.,1726.85,0.78
So it was Congress's jobto determine how to balance,1727.63,3.33
those competing interests.,1730.96,1.38
And it did hold--,1732.34,1.56
it did establish in Section--,1733.9,1.44
AMUL THAPAR: Wheredoes the power,1735.34,1.375
come from that gives Congressthe ability to balance,1736.715,2.605
those competing interests?,1739.32,1.36
"Because it doesn't seem to comefrom the Indian's, the Commerce",1740.68,3.24
Clause?,1743.92,1.237
"AL KELLEY: Well, Your Honor,this Court has consistently",1745.157,2.333
characterized Congress'spower under not just,1747.49,2.55
"the Indian CommerceClause, but also the treaty",1750.04,2.01
"clause as forming plenary, andexclusive grant of authority",1752.05,4.32
in this area.,1756.37,0.91
And there's no subjectmatter limitation,1757.28,2.42
on this power Congresshas saw fit to regulate,1759.7,2.387
in a wide range of areasthat affect [INAUDIBLE]..,1762.087,2.083
"AMUL THAPAR: Buthere, you have a child",1764.17,1.625
without any tribal membership.,1765.795,1.285
Right?,1767.08,1.55
"And so, I'm not sure,what's their interest",1768.63,2.34
in that situation?,1770.97,1.65
AL KELLEY: Congressstill has an interest,1772.62,1.86
as a part of its trustobligation towards the tribes,1774.48,3.99
to regulate with regardto these children.,1778.47,2.37
And this Court has neverlimited Congress's power,1780.84,3.21
in the field of IndianAffairs to regulating only,1784.05,2.79
enrolled members of tribes.,1786.84,1.5
"For example, in Mazurie, itregulated the sale of alcohol",1788.34,4.14
"by nontribal members inon, or near reservations.",1792.48,3.63
And this is a very broadgrant of authority.,1796.11,1.86
And the only time thatthis Court has ever,1797.97,1.98
found that a statute exceeds thebreadth of Congress's authority,1799.95,4.2
under the IndianCommerce Clause is,1804.15,1.53
when that statute has beenused to try to abrogate state,1805.68,3.75
sovereign immunity to violate.,1809.43,1.283
AMUL THAPAR: Doyou have any cases,1810.713,1.417
"where there wasn'ttribal membership,",1812.13,2.07
where we've upheld the law?,1814.2,1.33
"Because here, there'sno tribal membership.",1815.53,1.94
And you're asking us to hold it.,1817.47,2.12
"And in all the othercases I've seen,",1819.59,2.52
the cases related directlyto tribal membership.,1822.11,3.86
"AL KELLEY: Well, YourHonor, in the United States",1825.97,2.605
"versus Mazurie from 1975,the court applied a statute",1828.575,2.925
to non-tribal members.,1831.5,1.65
And it generally hasdone so with regard,1833.15,2.49
to on or nearreservation activities.,1835.64,4.89
And so it's never heldthat the Indian Commerce,1840.53,3.3
Clause is limited toonly regulating members,1843.83,3.57
of federally recognized tribes.,1847.4,1.59
"It can be anything that relatesto this trust obligation,",1848.99,3.24
as this issue surely does.,1852.23,2.19
"Now, respondents don't contestthat ICWA confers rights",1854.42,3.15
"on private actors, butinstead argue that it requires",1857.57,3.27
states to confer rights.,1860.84,1.65
But this conflatesrespect for rights,1862.49,2.94
with conferral for rights.,1865.43,1.59
"Unlike the statutes that wereat issue in New York and Murphy,",1867.02,3.66
ICWA doesn't requirestate legislatures,1870.68,2.13
to create any new standardsor pass any legislation.,1872.81,3.69
It simply requiresthat state actors,1876.5,2.37
comply with these generallyapplicable regulations.,1878.87,3.72
And any conferral ofrights will necessarily,1882.59,2.73
affect third parties.,1885.32,1.69
But ICWA's effects occurequally and even-handedly,1887.01,4.58
to both public andprivate actors.,1891.59,1.87
And it's thus similar to--,1893.46,1.203
"MICHELLE FRIEDLAND: I know youargue that, in that regard,",1894.663,2.417
it's similar to Garcia.,1897.08,2.97
But in Garcia theminimum wage requirements,1900.05,2.55
that defined thestates as employer,1902.6,2.988
applied to lots ofprivate employers.,1905.588,1.542
"And overall, there areprobably more private employers",1907.13,2.25
than there are state employers.,1909.38,1.38
"But here, aren'tchild welfare services",1910.76,2.73
usually government run?,1913.49,1.765
"So to the extent,part of your argument",1915.255,1.625
"is, well, there areprivate ones too, it's kind",1916.88,1.958
of the opposite of Garcia.,1918.838,1.432
"AL KELLEY: That may bethe case, Your Honor.",1920.27,1.833
"However, it's very similarto what this court faced",1922.103,2.247
"in Reno v Condon,in which Congress",1924.35,2.55
passed a law regulatingthe use of information,1926.9,3.27
created by state DMVs.,1930.17,2.19
And it held therethat the statute,1932.36,1.56
"was of generalapplication, because it",1933.92,1.95
"applied not just to state DMVs,but to the private parties who",1935.87,3.66
had obtained that informationfrom those agencies.,1939.53,2.79
"And so there, thestatute clearly",1942.32,2.4
have an outsizedeffect on states.,1944.72,2.08
"But the court stillheld that, because it",1946.8,2.0
was of generalapplication it didn't,1948.8,2.13
violate theanti-commandeering doctrine,1950.93,2.25
or implicate the same concernsthat this court was faced,1953.18,2.73
"with for example, in Prince.",1955.91,2.3
And this case is alsodistinguishable from what,1958.21,2.44
was at issue in Prince becausewhereas Prince involved,1960.65,3.3
"an unconditionalorder to state actors,",1963.95,3.26
ICWA is better understood asa limitation on state action.,1967.21,4.06
So the Brady HandgunAct Provision,1971.27,2.49
that was at issue in Princeordered state officers,1973.76,2.88
to conduct backgroundchecks irrespective,1976.64,2.25
of any other state action.,1978.89,1.58
But ICWA's mandatesonly come into effect,1980.47,2.53
when the state decidesto remove an Indian child,1983.0,3.33
from their biologicalparents or place that child,1986.33,2.85
in foster or adoptive care.,1989.18,2.16
And thus it's more similarto what this court faced,1991.34,3.69
"in South Carolina v Baker,where it held that states could",1995.03,3.78
be compelled to complywith obligations,1998.81,3.21
or regulations dealingwith the issuance of bonds.,2002.02,3.33
Because states had to makean affirmative decision,2005.35,2.19
to issue bonds before thoserequirements came into place.,2007.54,3.155
MICHELLE FRIEDLAND:So I know one,2010.695,1.375
of your argumentsin your brief is,2012.07,3.24
that we shouldn'tworry that people,2015.31,2.34
will blame the wrong sovereign.,2017.65,1.7
So if they're upsetabout ICWA they,2019.35,1.78
will understand thatICWA is a federal law,2021.13,3.69
because the federalgovernment usually is who's,2024.82,2.46
involved in Indian Affairs.,2027.28,1.86
But I think that assumesa much higher level,2029.14,3.12
of civics knowledge thanpeople usually have.,2032.26,2.067
There are lots of peoplein this country who,2034.327,1.833
can't name three branchesof government or members,2036.16,2.58
of our court.,2038.74,1.2
"And I'm wondering why youthink that people, especially",2039.94,3.27
"people like the Caldwellswho are not Native American,",2043.21,2.97
will understand how thefederal government interacts,2046.18,2.64
with Native Americans.,2048.82,1.26
"AL KELLEY: Well, twopoints on that, Your Honor.",2050.08,2.0
"First, this court has citedpolitical accountability",2052.08,2.53
as one of the concernsor rationales that,2054.61,5.79
undergrow theanti-commandeering doctrine.,2060.4,2.31
But it's neverheld that those are,2062.71,1.71
dispositive in the analysis.,2064.42,1.59
"But second, we doargue that the kind",2066.01,2.459
of political accountabilityconcerns that,2068.469,2.851
were added to in this Court'sprevious anti-commandeering,2071.32,2.46
cases aren't at issue here.,2073.78,1.441
And that's becausethe federal government,2075.221,1.708
does have a longstanding relationship,2076.929,2.881
with federal tribes.,2079.81,1.19
"AMUL THAPAR: Yeah, but I mean,what political accountability",2081.0,2.5
"comes down to is who are theygoing to hold accountable,",2083.5,2.52
just a simplified way.,2086.02,1.25
And all this occursin the state court,2087.27,2.56
"system as youyourself acknowledge,",2089.83,1.82
and the state system.,2091.65,1.1
So why wouldn't they belooking to the states?,2092.75,2.438
"AL KELLEY: Well,Your Honor, we think",2095.188,1.542
there are certain areas thatthe federal government has,2096.73,2.292
traditionally beenmore responsible for.,2099.022,2.388
"In our brief, wecite a statute that",2101.41,2.79
deals with family lawproceedings involving,2104.2,3.33
"service members, activeduty service members.",2107.53,2.13
And we think the sameimplications are at issue here.,2109.66,2.8
I think most people wouldn'thold the state government,2112.46,2.33
accountable fordifferent standards that,2114.79,1.98
apply to custody ordersinvolving active duty service,2116.77,2.68
members.,2119.45,0.5
And the same is truefor Indian tribes.,2119.95,1.637
"MERRICK GARLAND: SoI'm a new justice,",2121.587,1.583
and I'm trying to understand.,2123.17,2.0
What is the PoliticalAccountability Clause,2125.17,2.88
of the Constitutionof the United States?,2128.05,2.91
"There is no suchclause, is there?",2130.96,1.42
"AL KELLEY: Thereis not, Your Honor.",2132.38,1.5
"MERRICK GARLAND:So I tend to, when",2133.88,1.458
I think about this I refer toa famous law review article,2135.338,3.692
"by an obscure law school deannamed Manning, who Fortunately",2139.03,7.29
was saved from privatepractice by the fact,2146.32,2.49
that Arnold and Porterdid not hire him.,2148.81,3.81
And he takes the positionin this 2009 article,2152.62,3.66
that the NI commandeering entiredoctrine is atextual and worst,2156.28,6.75
"of all, purposovist.",2163.03,1.46
"Where does it come from,and should we not reconsider",2164.49,6.19
a doctrine that reallyhas no basis in the text,2170.68,2.25
of the Constitution?,2172.93,1.14
The Constitution has specificprovisions that provide,2174.07,3.09
the elements of federalism.,2177.16,1.2
"But to go beyond them, likepolitical accountability,",2178.36,3.39
that sounds like something wetalk about in poly sci courses.,2181.75,3.33
Why don't you just challengethe doctrine altogether?,2185.08,2.445
"AL KELLEY: Because Your Honor,the anti-commandeering doctrine",2187.525,2.583
is not centered in thetext or any one provision,2190.108,2.502
of the Constitution becauseit represents an omission,2192.61,2.76
from the Constitution.,2195.37,1.02
And that's the omission of thepower of the federal government,2196.39,2.94
to do--,2199.33,0.5
MERRICK GARLAND: So that seemslike the kind of argument,2199.83,1.36
the other side might make.,2201.19,1.823
You would do a lotbetter if there,2203.013,1.417
"were no anti-commandeeringprinciple, wouldn't you?",2204.43,2.583
"AL KELLEY: PerhapsYour Honor, but there",2207.013,1.667
is no anti-commandeering issueeven under the current doctrine,2208.68,3.3
here.,2211.98,0.5
And that's because what'sat issue here with ICWA,2212.48,2.85
is the kind of regulationthat Congress has frequently,2215.33,2.975
used in the past and has neverbeen understood to raise--,2218.305,2.375
MERRICK GARLAND: Whatabout the question,2220.68,0.97
of procedure versus substancethat I started with?,2221.65,2.76
"Can Congress enact procedures,rules of civil procedure",2224.41,6.54
to cover federal rightsin state causes of action?,2230.95,5.296
"AL KELLEY: Well, as thiscourt discussed in Jinx,",2236.246,2.354
it hasn't reached that question.,2238.6,1.56
MERRICK GARLAND: Sothat's why I'm asking you.,2240.16,2.07
Now we have toreach that question.,2242.23,1.755
AL KELLEY: I think for purelyprocedural guarantees or purely,2243.985,4.485
procedural mandatesthat may implicate,2248.47,2.297
the anti-commandeering doctrine.,2250.767,1.333
"But whenever those mandateshave a real substantive bite,",2252.1,3.39
"as they do here, it doesn'timplicate the doctrine.",2255.49,2.55
Because these areprocedural guarantees,2258.04,1.77
that are securing a right.,2259.81,1.56
And the anti-commandeeringdoctrine,2261.37,1.71
has never beenunderstood to prevent,2263.08,2.22
the federal governmentfrom conferring rights,2265.3,2.04
on private actors.,2267.34,1.495
And it's also never--,2268.835,0.875
MERRICK GARLAND: What aboutthis provision that requires,2269.71,2.333
you to produce an expert?,2272.043,1.437
Is that proceduralor substantive?,2273.48,3.331
"AL KELLEY: Likely similarto the other guarantees,",2276.811,2.859
it would be a proceduralguarantee that,2279.67,1.71
secures a substantive right.,2281.38,1.65
And there it's theright of Indian families,2283.03,2.34
to remain together.,2285.37,0.87
"If the state wishes to remove achild in certain circumstances,",2286.24,3.6
it must producean expert witness.,2289.84,1.65
"But as this courtdiscussed in Prince,",2291.49,2.64
this kind of productionof expert witnesses,2294.13,1.92
"has a long history,and has been allowed",2296.05,2.25
in the past for congressionalmandates on state courts.,2298.3,2.89
Thank you.,2301.19,1.202
[APPLAUSE],2302.392,2.43
MERRICK GARLAND: We will nowhear from the respondents.,2314.55,2.33
"MELANIE FONTS: Thankyou, Mr. Chief Justice.",2316.88,1.833
And may it please the court.,2318.713,1.197
"My name is Melanie Fonts, andon behalf of respondents Bryce",2319.91,3.09
and Candice Caldwelland the state of Ames,2323.0,2.43
I will address theequal protection issue.,2325.43,2.9
This court should affirm thejudgment of the Ames Circuit,2328.33,3.15
and holds that the Indian ChildWelfare Act and the final rule,2331.48,3.36
are unconstitutionalfor three reasons.,2334.84,3.07
"First, ICWA classifieschildren on the basis",2337.91,2.75
of their Indianancestry and thus,2340.66,2.28
is a racial classificationsubject to strict scrutiny.,2342.94,3.6
"Second, ICWA failsstrict scrutiny",2346.54,2.58
because it is notnarrowly tailored,2349.12,1.77
to a compellinggovernment interest.,2350.89,2.43
"And third, even if ICWA diduse a political classification",2353.32,4.08
it fails any lowerstandard of review,2357.4,2.22
because it is notrationally related,2359.62,1.98
to a legitimate state interest.,2361.6,2.2
"Thus, we ask thatthis court strike down",2363.8,1.84
ICWA and the final rule.,2365.64,2.07
"First, ICWA operateson the basis",2367.71,2.35
"of a racial classification,not a political classification.",2370.06,3.185
MICHELLE FRIEDLAND: So it seems like--,2373.245,1.705
I'm sorry.,2374.95,0.36
"MERRICK GARLAND:No, no, go ahead.",2375.31,0.48
MICHELLE FRIEDLAND : It seemslike a lot of your argument,2375.79,2.375
on this point and other pointshas to do with the second,2378.165,2.935
choice preference of goingto a different tribe instead,2381.1,2.76
of the tribe that aparent is a member of.,2383.86,2.64
I'm wondering if we agreewith you that that part is not,2386.5,4.225
"rational or doesn't have acompelling interest, depending",2390.725,2.375
"on what standardapplies, and we find",2393.1,2.07
"that to be severable,whether you still",2395.17,2.61
have all of your arguments asto the remainder of the statute.,2397.78,3.15
"MELANIE FONTS: Yes,Your Honor we do.",2400.93,1.56
And that's because weunderstand to sever,2402.49,1.77
any part of either thedefinition or the placement,2404.26,2.61
preferences or anyother part of ICWA,2406.87,2.25
would be to change fundamentallythe applicability of the law.,2409.12,3.592
We know this becausewe know that--,2412.712,1.458
"AMUL THAPAR: OK, but dowe just ignore, then,",2414.17,2.54
Congress's severability clause?,2416.71,2.22
It seems to me Congressgets to make that call.,2418.93,3.142
"MELANIE FONTS: YourHonor, Congress",2422.072,1.458
does get to make this call.,2423.53,1.23
"However, we have evidence fromthe legislative history where",2424.76,3.0
we see that theDepartment of Justice,2427.76,1.71
"asked Congress twice to change,for example, the definition--",2429.47,2.87
"MERRICK GARLAND: Thatword, legislative history,",2432.34,2.0
I don't think I like that word.,2434.34,2.102
AMUL THAPAR: Ithink Dean Manning's,2436.442,1.458
written about that too.,2437.9,1.502
"MERRICK GARLAND: Yeah, I know.",2439.402,1.398
I don't like that.,2440.8,3.63
"I may be jumping the gun,but to take the question",2444.43,4.57
from the justice on myright a little bit further.,2449.0,3.836
Is your position that allclassifications that are,2452.836,2.924
based on ancestry are racial?,2455.76,3.078
"MELANIE FONTS: Yes, Your Honor.",2458.838,1.292
MERRICK GARLAND: Soaren't all Indians tribes,2460.13,3.78
based on ancestry?,2463.91,1.95
"That is, everyrecognized Indian tribe",2465.86,3.75
"requires that there be someoriginal historical group,",2469.61,4.73
and that the currentmembers are descendants,2474.34,2.53
"of that group, isn't that true?",2476.87,1.513
"MELANIE FONTS: Thatis true, Your Honor.",2478.383,1.667
It's our understandingthat the presumption,2480.05,1.83
"is where a lawclassifies on ancestry,",2481.88,2.4
"and thus race, it is aracial classification",2484.28,2.91
"unless the law fitsinto the narrow,",2487.19,2.25
carved out space of Mancari.,2489.44,2.15
Mancari is a narrow exceptionto our understanding,2491.59,2.68
of racial classification.,2494.27,1.71
As this court made clear inits opinion in that case--,2495.98,3.695
MERRICK GARLAND: Whatis the narrowing?,2499.675,1.625
"Why doesn't, under your theory,every federal law relating",2501.3,5.33
to Indian tribes subjectto strict scrutiny?,2506.63,4.11
"Because every Indiantribe, every current member",2510.74,3.6
has to trace theirancestry one way or another,2514.34,3.69
to the originalhistorical tribes.,2518.03,4.515
MELANIE FONTS: Although everytribe has some ancestral,2522.545,2.775
"requirement formembership, we recognize",2525.32,2.97
"that there is a politicalact involved, rather,",2528.29,2.31
two political acts involvedin membership in a federally,2530.6,3.12
recognized tribe.,2533.72,1.23
The first of thosepolitical acts,2534.95,2.91
is the actual recognitionby the federal government,2537.86,2.79
of that tribe.,2540.65,1.11
The second is the affirmativechoice an individual,2541.76,2.25
makes to join that tribe.,2544.01,1.71
"Without those twopolitical acts,",2545.72,2.1
what we have is theracial group of Indians.,2547.82,2.19
"MERRICK GARLAND:OK, so now you're",2550.01,1.47
"talking about theenrollment question, right?",2551.48,2.22
"Is that what you're saying, thatthe problem here is the child's",2553.7,2.667
not yet enrolled?,2556.367,0.783
"MELANIE FONTS: Yes, Your Honor.",2557.15,1.292
"MERRICK GARLAND: So let's assumethat the statute ended at 4A,",2558.442,4.178
and the child was alreadya member of a tribe.,2562.62,2.99
Is that a racial classification?,2565.61,1.53
"MELANIE FONTS: Yes, Your Honor.",2567.14,1.59
MERRICK GARLAND:So then it doesn't,2568.73,0.93
matter whether it's enrolled.,2569.66,1.208
Your position is everymember of every tribe,2570.868,6.622
comes through ancestry.,2577.49,1.35
And therefore every rulethe federal government,2578.84,3.13
relating to Indians issubject to strict scrutiny.,2581.97,2.27
Is that right?,2584.24,0.678
"MELANIE FONTS: Notquite, Your Honor.",2584.918,1.542
And that's becauseMancari recognizes,2586.46,2.16
that a law ceases to bea racial classification,2588.62,2.7
and becomes a politicalclassification where,2591.32,2.27
there are two factors present.,2593.59,2.86
First is that the lawapplies only to members,2596.45,2.37
of federally recognized tribes.,2598.82,1.92
And second is thatthe legislation,2600.74,2.19
aims at the federalinterests in furthering,2602.93,2.16
tribal self-government.,2605.09,1.53
"So where this law, which doesnot aim at furthering tribal",2606.62,3.48
"self-government, even if--",2610.1,1.143
AMUL THAPAR: Why doesn't it?,2611.243,1.167
I'm not sure I follow you.,2612.41,1.2
Why wouldn't it aim infurthering self-government?,2613.61,2.67
If the whole principleis to keep the tribes,2616.28,3.54
"and allow people that shouldbe members to be members,",2619.82,3.54
isn't that fosteringself-government ultimately?,2623.36,2.82
MELANIE FONTS: Not asthis court has understood.,2626.18,2.1
"In Mancari, we saw thatthis court understood",2628.28,2.4
tribal self-governancequite narrowly,2630.68,1.92
as a political andeconomic interest,2632.6,1.86
to paraphrase from the opinion.,2634.46,1.64
"And the Ninth Circuit hashelpfully defined this for us,",2636.1,2.8
and told us to look foruniquely Indian interests--,2638.9,2.4
MERRICK GARLAND: TheNinth Circuit actually,2641.3,1.792
doesn't carry much sway here.,2643.092,2.288
And Mancari only talked about--,2648.53,2.46
"no disrespect to the NinthCircuit, but it is the fact.",2650.99,3.225
Mancari talked abouttribal self-government,2657.05,2.26
as something thatmattered in that case.,2659.31,3.65
Did we suggest thatthat was the only,2662.96,2.21
possible ground forrecognizing this,2665.17,4.17
as a political circumstance?,2669.34,2.28
The example that my colleagueon the left expresses,2671.62,3.3
is close to tribal government.,2674.92,2.0
We never said tribalself-government,2676.92,1.72
was the only thingthat would satisfy us.,2678.64,4.323
"MELANIE FONTS: YourHonor, this court did not.",2682.963,1.917
"However, if we look at the lineof cases following Mancari,",2684.88,3.42
we see that tribalself-governance,2688.3,1.62
has been construed narrowly.,2689.92,1.65
"So we can fast forward, forexample, to Rice in 2000 where",2691.57,3.09
this court held that thecandidate qualification,2694.66,2.64
preference for native Hawaiianswho had an ancestor who,2697.3,4.63
"was present in theHawaiian Islands in 1778,",2701.93,3.56
that even if nativeHawaiians were members,2705.49,3.96
"of a federally recognizedtribe, that preference",2709.45,2.4
would still fail Mancari.,2711.85,1.86
Because it went tocritical state affairs.,2713.71,2.22
Even though the Office ofHawaiian Affairs in many ways,2715.93,3.15
functioned similar to parts ofthe Bureau of Indian Affairs.,2719.08,3.25
And we can see thistime and time again,2722.33,1.82
if we look at this court'sprecedent following Mancari.,2724.15,2.305
"MICHELLE FRIEDLAND : Butin both of those cases,",2726.455,2.165
there was some tribal ornative-related entity.,2728.62,4.29
But we're talkingabout the tribe itself.,2732.91,2.17
How can the tribesurvive without members?,2735.08,2.815
"MELANIE FONTS: Your Honor,while the tribe cannot survive",2737.895,2.375
without members the questionbefore us right now is whether,2740.27,3.24
that interest is enough to lowerthe standard of review here.,2743.51,3.9
We argue that it is not becausethat falls outside this court's,2747.41,2.97
long-held understandingof where there,2750.38,2.16
is a political classification.,2752.54,1.69
So to turn to some examples.,2754.23,1.74
"We see in cases likeFisher and Angelo,",2755.97,2.72
those cases involved politicalclassifications not just,2758.69,4.92
because they appliedonly to members,2763.61,1.71
"of federally recognized tribes,but because they advanced",2765.32,3.18
tribal politicalself governance that,2768.5,2.13
is transferring jurisdictionfrom state courts,2770.63,2.64
to tribal and federal courts.,2773.27,1.98
"In Moe, for example,we saw that the law",2775.25,2.16
was a political classificationbecause it advanced,2777.41,2.34
"economicself-governance, that is,",2779.75,1.89
providing the Indiantribe tax immunity,2781.64,2.37
from local and state taxes.,2784.01,1.8
MERRICK GARLAND: Why isn'tmaintaining the human beings,2785.81,2.88
who are going to makeup a tribe as much,2788.69,2.91
a matter of the continuingself-government of the tribe,2791.6,3.62
as is economic issues?,2795.22,4.11
Why isn't it more important?,2799.33,2.222
Seems like it wouldcome a fortiori,2801.552,1.458
if we're going to protecteconomic interests of the tribe,2803.01,2.75
that we're to protect theirinterests in surviving,2805.76,2.95
to the next generation.,2808.71,1.482
"MELANIE FONTS:Because, Your Honor,",2810.192,1.458
the inquiry here is justwhether the standard of review,2811.65,2.55
ought to change becauseof the interests involved.,2814.2,3.45
"We construe tribal selfgovernance narrowly,",2817.65,2.332
not because we don'trecognize that there might,2819.982,1.958
"be other tribalinterests at stake,",2821.94,1.95
but because we realizethat Congress ought,2823.89,2.01
to be owed more deference whereit is legislating with respect,2825.9,3.0
to tribal Indians.,2828.9,1.35
But that same levelof deference can't,2830.25,1.77
be owed where the federalgovernment is aiming,2832.02,2.43
at something other thanthat narrow conception,2834.45,3.09
of tribal self-governance.,2837.54,1.31
AMUL THAPAR: Can Igo back to your--,2838.85,1.03
I'm sorry to interrupt.,2839.88,0.76
Can I go back to your racialclassification for a second?,2840.64,2.35
Because I'm struggling.,2842.99,0.958
So can a tribe define itsmembers however it wants?,2843.948,2.625
"MELANIE FONTS: Withinsome limits, Your Honor,",2846.573,1.917
"as this court held inSanta Clara v Martinez,",2848.49,4.05
the tribes have broad authorityto set their own membership,2852.54,3.84
requirements.,2856.38,0.97
"However, we can see withsome of the lower courts",2857.35,2.18
that there are some limits.,2859.53,1.5
"For example, if we look at the[INAUDIBLE] case, for which",2861.03,3.39
"this court denied comingout of the Tenth Circuit,",2864.42,2.76
there the TenthCircuit held that where,2867.18,3.15
"the tribe had changed itseligibility requirement, where",2870.33,3.57
it had automatically enrolledchildren for 240 days,2873.9,3.9
after birth in order to avoidany perverse consequences,2877.8,4.83
with ICWA.,2882.63,0.78
There the court struck downthat membership requirement,2883.41,3.0
because it held that thatwas just doing gamesmanship,2886.41,2.34
with a federal statute.,2888.75,1.29
Similar to--,2890.04,0.63
AMUL THAPAR: So assumethey're not doing gamesmanship,2890.67,2.21
with the federal statute.,2892.88,1.34
"But assume, as you I thinkacknowledged in your briefs,",2894.22,2.9
"they're lettingwhites in, descendants",2897.12,3.03
"of slaves, people that have noancestry traced to the tribe.",2900.15,3.84
You would still call ita racial classification,2903.99,2.19
under that circumstance?,2906.18,1.2
"MELANIE FONTS: Yes,Your Honor, it's",2907.38,1.5
still a racial classificationunder that circumstance,2908.88,2.49
for three reasons.,2911.37,2.08
"First, even though a law mayclassify other individuals",2913.45,4.16
"excluding or outsidethat racial group,",2917.61,2.61
the law is not any lessof a racial classification,2920.22,2.85
where race is thepredominant factor.,2923.07,1.805
And we can see this inother equal protection cases,2924.875,2.125
"for example, inMiller v Johnson.",2927.0,2.19
"Second, This court has held thatthe political classification",2929.19,5.43
is narrowed to members offederally recognized tribes.,2934.62,2.94
Because it recognizesthat there is an official,2937.56,2.07
process for thatfederal recognition.,2939.63,2.052
"For example, if we look atthe Federal Acknowledgment",2941.682,2.208
"Act, which has governedthe federal recognition",2943.89,2.91
"process since 1994,part of that act",2946.8,3.12
requires that tribes submitconstitutions and bylaws,2949.92,3.63
defining their membership.,2953.55,1.65
So federal recognitionis predicated,2955.2,2.1
on an understandingof how the tribe will,2957.3,2.13
define its membership.,2959.43,1.75
"And as the DCCircuit, for example,",2961.18,2.07
held in Cherokee Nation versusNash very recently where--,2963.25,3.197
MERRICK GARLAND: That'sanother circuit that,2966.447,1.833
doesn't get much sway up here.,2968.28,1.25
MICHELLE FRIEDLAND : Iwas going to interrupt.,2969.53,1.993
"MELANIE FONTS: But toprovide an example, there,",2971.523,3.207
where the CherokeeNation attempted,2974.73,1.92
to disenroll the descendantsof former freedmen,2976.65,4.29
"and former slaves,the Court struck down",2980.94,3.09
that membershipchange because it,2984.03,1.77
acted against an 1866 treaty.,2985.8,2.28
So we understand thatmembership is tied to the--,2988.08,2.31
MERRICK GARLAND:Can I get back to--,2990.39,1.5
"I think it was theTenth Circuit, which",2991.89,1.44
"we're going to give some swayto, that you are talking about.",2993.33,2.61
"But which unfortunately,I didn't read the opinion.",2995.94,2.32
Because it's acircuit and we only,2998.26,1.91
read our own opinions up here.,3000.17,2.47
Are you saying it held that youcan't have automatic enrollment,3002.64,3.41
in the tribe?,3006.05,0.97
"MELANIE FONTS: No, Your Honor.",3007.02,1.25
There the TenthCircuit took notice,3008.27,1.86
that the tribe hadchanged its enrollment,3010.13,2.25
criteria simply to avoidthe application of ICWA.,3012.38,2.97
So there becomes a question ofwhen the court will question.,3015.35,2.75
MERRICK GARLAND: Sowhat if the tribe,3018.1,2.53
had birthright citizenship?,3020.63,2.07
"Right, you're born ofa member of the tribe,",3022.7,4.74
you're automaticallyin the tribe.,3027.44,1.65
"Just like you're born of anAmerican, you're an American.",3029.09,4.41
"Would that be OK or not OK,from your point of view?",3033.5,3.397
"MELANIE FONTS: YourHonor, it depends.",3036.897,1.583
If that automaticenrollment process was,3038.48,2.34
part of the membershipcriteria submitted,3040.82,2.22
through the FederalAcknowledgment Act or however,3043.04,2.19
the tribe were recognized--,3045.23,1.2
"MERRICK GARLAND: Yeah, I'minterested in the question",3046.43,1.23
"whether you think that'sracial or not racial,",3047.66,2.46
whether it be subject tostrict scrutiny or not,3050.12,2.67
strict scrutiny?,3052.79,1.68
"If a tribe just wantedto say, everybody",3054.47,2.16
born of a member of the tribeis a member of the tribe,3056.63,2.79
rather than having to enrollits children separately,3059.42,4.95
"for some reason,would that child--",3064.37,7.11
it would be appropriate to treatthat child under ICWA the way,3071.48,2.93
the Caldwell's fosterchild was treated here?,3074.41,3.6
"MELANIE FONTS: Presumablyyes, Your Honor.",3078.01,1.75
However if that werethe case that we,3079.76,1.8
"had tribes automaticallyenrolling their members,",3081.56,2.82
that would fundamentally changeour analysis under Mancari.,3084.38,3.46
Mancari is clear that whenlegislation applies only,3087.84,4.19
to members of federallyrecognized tribes,3092.03,2.34
it ought to be considereda political classification.,3094.37,2.953
MICHELLE FRIEDLAND : Butwe're talking about babies.,3097.323,2.167
So I don't know--,3099.49,1.18
"I mean, what is thedifference between what",3100.67,2.06
"ICWA actually does, at leastwith respect to children of",3102.73,4.87
and their relationship to atribe that one of their parents,3107.6,2.61
was a member of that theycould become a member of?,3110.21,2.16
If they're just babiesand they haven't yet,3112.37,2.79
"had the opportunityto make a choice,",3115.16,1.98
why shouldn't they be treatedas the birthright example?,3117.14,3.625
"MELANIE FONTS: For tworeasons, Your Honor.",3120.765,2.035
"Children, like anyother individual,",3122.8,1.92
retain the choice toenroll in an Indian tribe,3124.72,2.85
at any point in their lives.,3127.57,1.57
So ICWA does nothing toadvance or prevent that choice.,3129.14,3.99
"However, even if we wereto take special solicitude",3133.13,2.748
of the fact--,3135.878,0.542
"MICHELLE FRIEDLAND : But ICWAdoes advance that choice,",3136.42,2.1
doesn't it?,3138.52,0.52
Because it makesit much more likely,3139.04,1.52
that they're living withmembers of the tribe.,3140.56,2.25
"If the tribe has a reservationthat they're there perhaps,",3142.81,3.363
rather than with someone with noconnection to the tribe at all.,3146.173,2.667
Doesn't that makeit much more likely,3148.84,1.2
that they'll become amember of the tribe?,3150.04,1.29
"MELANIE FONTS: Not necessarily,Your Honor, for the simple fact",3151.33,2.85
that the 1915 placementpreferences don't,3154.18,2.58
"set any procedural safeguardsfor that sort of choice,",3156.76,2.97
and even allow thechild to be transferred,3159.73,2.1
to another tribe to which theyhave no ancestral connection,3161.83,2.92
"and to which, like CJthey may never be--",3164.75,2.3
AMUL THAPAR: Can I stopyou on the first half,3167.05,1.21
because I'm notsure I understand.,3168.26,1.417
"Are you saying that if they areraised by members of the tribe,",3169.677,2.983
they're not more likely toparticipate in the tribe?,3172.66,6.19
MELANIE FONTS: It may be thatthose particular children may,3178.85,2.85
be more likely tojoin the tribe.,3181.7,2.25
"However, we're--",3183.95,0.67
AMUL THAPAR: Sowhy wouldn't that,3184.62,1.52
be an interest in whichthe government can promote?,3186.14,4.1
MELANIE FONTS: Because thelaw does not hew that closely.,3190.24,3.33
"When we look atthe text of ICWA,",3193.57,1.53
"it's applying to a vast majorityof Indian children, that",3195.1,3.0
is enrolled tribalchildren and those who are,3198.1,2.37
eligible for tribal membership.,3200.47,1.86
And the proceduralsafeguards set forth,3202.33,2.07
"in the placement preferences,for example, are thin.",3204.4,2.73
They do not guaranteethat the child,3207.13,2.25
will be placed witha family and thus,3209.38,1.98
enroll in that Indian tribe.,3211.36,1.79
Then this--,3213.15,0.5
MICHELLE FRIEDLAND : Butyou're arguing that there,3213.65,1.34
shouldn't even be an attempt.,3214.99,1.26
"I mean, just becauseit's not perfect",3216.25,1.65
"or it doesn'talways guarantee it,",3217.9,1.44
does that meanCongress can't try?,3219.34,2.445
"MELANIE FONTS:Your Honor, insofar",3221.785,2.235
as ICWA is a racialclassification,3224.02,1.95
"subject to strictscrutiny, Congress may not.",3225.97,2.41
And that--,3228.38,0.5
MICHELLE FRIEDLAND : SoI'm wondering whether it,3228.88,1.47
even is a compelling interest.,3230.35,1.5
"I mean, the historyhere is terrible.",3231.85,2.28
"The federal governmentran, I believe,",3234.13,1.64
150 or more boarding schools andsent Native American children,3235.77,3.65
to them.,3239.42,0.5
And they were beaten if theyspoke their native languages.,3239.92,2.92
"I mean, there wasa massive effort",3242.84,1.43
to assimilate these childrenso that tribes would,3244.27,2.16
be wiped out of existence.,3246.43,1.5
Why is it not acompelling interest,3247.93,1.56
to remedy that history?,3249.49,1.29
"MELANIE FONTS: Your Honor,it's not a compelling interest",3250.78,2.46
to remedy thathistory because that's,3253.24,1.77
not the history thatCongress was responding to.,3255.01,2.47
"As petitioners notein their own brief,",3257.48,2.15
that history withthe boarding schools,3259.63,1.89
ended well before considerationof ICWA before Congress.,3261.52,3.93
And so the state--,3265.45,0.75
MICHELLE FRIEDLAND : Butwasn't it the beginning--,3266.2,1.11
"I mean, maybe not the beginning.",3267.31,1.15
There's a longhistory of problems.,3268.46,1.59
But it was a big chunkof a problem that,3270.05,2.72
"led to tribes nothaving as many members,",3272.77,1.92
which then maybe gotcontinued by states.,3274.69,3.1
But that was a serious problemfor tribes having members.,3277.79,3.317
So I don't understand how that'snot still part of the history,3281.107,2.583
that could be attemptedto be remedied.,3283.69,1.715
"MELANIE FONTS:Your Honor, that's",3285.405,1.375
because it falls outside thiscourt's jurisprudence on what,3286.78,2.91
qualifies as acompelling state interest,3289.69,2.05
where we're consideringpast discrimination.,3291.74,2.42
This court has consistently heldat [INAUDIBLE] that remedying,3294.16,3.75
discrimination without moreis not a compelling interest,3297.91,3.66
unless the federalgovernment shows,3301.57,1.92
that it was thegovernmental actor,3303.49,1.577
doing the discriminating--,3305.067,1.083
MERRICK GARLAND:I don't think so.,3306.15,1.417
I think you're misconstruing[INAUDIBLE] and [INAUDIBLE]..,3307.567,3.163
The issue in both of thosecases was whether the preference,3310.73,4.28
applied to the entitythat had committed,3315.01,3.68
the history of discrimination.,3318.69,3.67
It wasn't a question of whetherthe federal government could,3322.36,3.18
apply the preferenceto that same entity.,3325.54,3.097
The federal governmentis not applying,3328.637,1.583
this preference to itselfbased on discrimination,3330.22,3.39
in the states.,3333.61,1.29
It is applying thepreference to the states,3334.9,2.76
"based on discrimination by thestates, past discrimination.",3337.66,4.63
So I think we're goingto have to strike out,3342.29,3.11
a new kind of case law hereto go where you're going.,3345.4,6.93
Explain to me why[INAUDIBLE] and [INAUDIBLE],3352.33,2.4
really match this question.,3354.73,1.753
"MELANIE FONTS: Your Honor,those cases match this question",3356.483,2.417
because theyrecognize that there,3358.9,1.375
must be a strongbasis in the evidence,3360.275,1.895
to use remedyingpast discrimination,3362.17,2.49
as a compelling state interest.,3364.66,1.68
"And that's because,due to this country's",3366.34,3.03
"historical discriminationagainst racial minorities,",3369.37,3.48
we recognize that this idea ofremedying past discrimination,3372.85,3.21
is simply tooamorphous a concept,3376.06,2.04
"to justifyconstitutional injury,",3378.1,2.22
"not just on those classified bythe law, but by other actors--",3380.32,3.15
MICHELLE FRIEDLAND : So is thereanything that Congress could do,3383.47,2.67
to remedy these past injustices?,3386.14,1.948
"MELANIE FONTS: Yes, Your Honor.",3388.088,1.292
Congress could pass a lawgranting tribal courts,3389.38,3.03
exclusive jurisdictionover adoption,3392.41,2.28
proceedings for tribal childrenliving on or near reservations.,3394.69,3.78
That would fall withinCongress's power.,3398.47,3.704
[APPLAUSE],3402.174,2.46
"KELSEY FRAZIER:Mr. Chief Justice,",3413.973,1.417
and may it please the court.,3415.39,1.5
The second issue in thiscase is whether Congress,3416.89,2.22
can compel thestates to implement,3419.11,1.47
a federal regulatoryprogram on its behalf.,3420.58,2.82
Under the anti-commandeeringdoctrine the answer is no.,3423.4,3.21
ICWA is thus unconstitutionaland should be struck down.,3426.61,3.57
When the framersdrafted the Constitution,3430.18,1.86
they explicitly chose toestablish the federal and state,3432.04,2.82
"governments as separatespheres of sovereignty,",3434.86,2.393
and to grant the federalgovernment the power to act,3437.253,2.167
"on individuals, not on states.",3439.42,2.082
"MICHELLE FRIEDLAND: So, I know one",3441.502,1.458
of your arguments is that familylaw is the realm of the states.,3442.96,3.33
But I believe yourcolleague just,3446.29,1.89
said that we could take anentire aspect of family law,3448.18,3.36
away and give it totribal governments.,3451.54,1.98
How is that not abigger imposition than,3453.52,2.46
what has been done here?,3455.98,1.435
"KELSEY FRAZIER: Your Honor, ifthat transfer of jurisdiction",3457.415,3.875
were limited toindividuals who fall,3461.29,2.16
"within the federal government'spower over Indian Affairs,",3463.45,2.88
whether that's understood asbeing in the Indian Commerce,3466.33,2.43
"Clause or an understandingof plenary power,",3468.76,2.96
a transfer of jurisdiction totribes might be permissible.,3471.72,5.72
"One of the keyinfirmities with ICWA,",3477.44,1.58
"however, is that it'snot limited to that group",3479.02,2.22
of individuals withinCongress's power,3481.24,2.46
under the Indian Affairs power.,3483.7,2.67
"That's because, as you'vediscussed with my colleague,",3486.37,3.03
it regulates alsochildren who are not,3489.4,2.04
enrolled members of tribes.,3491.44,1.44
It also regulates the parents ofthose children who might not be,3492.88,2.7
"Indian at all, as in this case.",3495.58,1.89
"And even the adoptiveparents, whose rights--",3497.47,2.317
MERRICK GARLAND: Soyou're challenging,3499.787,1.583
the other provisions ofICWA's big violations,3501.37,2.61
of equal protection?,3503.98,2.473
KELSEY FRAZIER: Your Honor--,3506.453,1.167
MERRICK GARLAND: Sojust only an as applied,3507.62,2.39
challenge to the child inthis case and to the fact,3510.01,7.02
that this child in thiscase is not enrolled member?,3517.03,2.91
"KELSEY FRAZIER: No, Your Honor.",3519.94,1.41
This is a facialchallenge to law because--,3521.35,2.233
MERRICK GARLAND: Howcan it be if you're,3523.583,1.667
telling my colleaguethat if it were limited,3525.25,2.52
"in certain ways, that is ifwe severed out the bad parts",3527.77,3.3
"and saved the goodparts, it would be OK?",3531.07,1.857
"KELSEY FRAZIER: YourHonor, for the purposes",3532.927,1.833
"of the equalprotection challenge,",3534.76,1.417
the focus is on the definition.,3536.177,1.643
"And as you've discussed,our primary issue",3537.82,2.905
with the definitionis the second part.,3540.725,1.625
"That is the part that appliesnot to enroll tribal members,",3542.35,3.19
but to children who are eligibleto be members of tribes.,3545.54,3.08
That's relevant to thecommandeering analysis,3548.62,2.06
in so far as inorder for this law,3550.68,2.71
"to be a valid exercise ofCongress's preemption power,",3553.39,3.88
it needs to be withinCongress's power.,3557.27,2.24
And it's our argumentthat it is not,3559.51,2.07
because it extends beyond that.,3561.58,2.1
But this law is also aconstitutional violation,3563.68,3.33
because it is not bestread as a law that,3567.01,2.31
regulates private actors.,3569.32,1.23
"That's the second partof the Murphy test,",3570.55,2.19
that is merely a restatement ofthe proposition that Congress,3572.74,3.27
cannot commandeer the states.,3576.01,1.99
And because ICWA--,3578.0,1.02
AMUL THAPAR: How are theycommandeering states?,3579.02,1.958
With specific provisionscommandeered the states?,3580.978,2.082
"KELSEY FRAZIER: Your Honor, ourchallenge is focused on 1911,",3583.06,3.06
"1912, 1913, and 1915,which are essentially",3586.12,4.05
the provisions that requirestates to implement ICWA.,3590.17,3.3
So they're the provisionsthat require state executive,3593.47,2.25
"officers, namely employees ofthe Child Protective Services",3595.72,2.67
"division, to say takeactive efforts to prevent",3598.39,3.27
the breakup of Indian families.,3601.66,1.768
They're the provisionsthat change the procedures,3603.428,2.042
that state courts have to followwhen adjudicating state law.,3605.47,3.068
AMUL THAPAR: I'm notsure I follow why they,3608.538,1.792
don't have the plenary power.,3610.33,2.49
"Because they have plenarypower over Indian Affairs,",3612.82,2.31
why wouldn't they beallowed to do this?,3615.13,2.34
"In other words, they're notcommandeering in the same way",3617.47,3.18
as Prince or Murphy.,3620.65,3.3
"They're not doing anything tothe executive or legislature,",3623.95,2.9
per se.,3626.85,1.42
"KELSEY FRAZIER:Well, Your Honor,",3628.27,1.39
we believe this is notwithin the Indian Affairs,3629.66,2.0
power for two reasons.,3631.66,1.21
One reason is thatthis regulates,3632.87,1.49
"too broad a groupof individuals,",3634.36,1.53
as we've just discussed.,3635.89,1.35
The other reason isthat even if this,3637.24,1.68
"were a law limited to thatgroup of individuals, that",3638.92,2.55
"is, tribal members, theplenary power is not absolute",3641.47,3.938
as this court has heldsince at least Creek,3645.408,1.792
Nation and [INAUDIBLE].,3647.2,1.71
"And most relevant, this courtheld in Seminole Tribe v",3648.91,3.21
"Florida that theIndian Affairs power,",3652.12,3.0
"even if understoodto be plenary,",3655.12,1.68
is limited by the provisionsof the Constitution.,3656.8,2.4
They are the relevant provisionwas the 11th Amendment.,3659.2,2.58
The court held thatCongress did not,3661.78,1.86
have the ability underthe Indian Affairs power,3663.64,2.64
to abrogate state sovereignimmunity in violation,3666.28,2.37
of the 11th Amendment.,3668.65,1.15
"Here, theanti-commandeering doctrine",3669.8,2.3
provides the limitation.,3672.1,1.57
And so even if this isregulating the right group,3673.67,2.75
of individualsbecause it requires,3676.42,2.16
"the states to implementit, this is a violation",3678.58,3.3
of the Constitution.,3681.88,2.188
MERRICK GARLAND: Let'sseparate out the executive,3684.068,2.042
from the courts for a moment.,3686.11,1.2
"With respect to thecourts, doesn't it",3687.31,1.583
just require the courtsto enforce federal law?,3688.893,2.63
"KELSEY FRAZIER: Itdoes not, Your Honor,",3691.523,1.667
at least not in a way thatthis court has upheld before.,3693.19,3.21
This court hassaid that Congress,3696.4,1.86
can issue some directionto the state courts.,3698.26,2.16
"That is, Congress canrequire state courts",3700.42,2.49
"to hear federalcauses of action,",3702.91,1.38
at least when thestate courts would,3704.29,1.5
hear them if thosesame causes of action,3705.79,1.667
arose under state law.,3707.457,1.153
That's the Testa line of cases.,3708.61,1.828
And that's what the courtsin New York and Prince,3710.438,2.042
are citing when theysuggest that there,3712.48,1.717
might be an exception to theanti-commandeering doctrine,3714.197,2.333
for courts.,3716.53,1.05
But what ICWA does is different.,3717.58,2.42
ICWA does not create afederal cause of action.,3720.0,2.27
"Indeed, the text of ICWAitself says repeatedly",3722.27,2.87
that these are proceedingsunder state law.,3725.14,2.25
"Instead, ICWA ischanging the procedures",3727.39,2.1
by which state judges--,3729.49,1.34
MERRICK GARLAND: So if wethink of what's happening here,3730.83,4.6
as conferring a right onthe child and the tribe,3735.43,5.27
to not have the childremoved outside of the tribe.,3740.7,3.76
And what Congress is sayingis that the state court,3744.46,6.3
has to enforce that right.,3750.76,2.07
You're saying that violatesanti-commandeering.,3752.83,3.132
"KELSEY FRAZIER: Weare, Your Honor.",3755.962,1.458
MERRICK GARLAND: So what ifCongress passed a statute that,3757.42,2.417
said state courts cannotdiscriminate against,3759.837,2.713
African-American children.,3762.55,3.69
"And we're not givinga cause of action,",3766.24,2.07
just saying theycan't discriminate.,3768.31,1.55
"And if they do, thenthey're acting in violation",3769.86,3.82
of the Supremacy Clause.,3773.68,2.07
We're preempting anycontrary state statute.,3775.75,3.7
Why is this any different?,3779.45,1.668
"KELSEY FRAZIER: Well, YourHonor, because in that case,",3781.118,2.292
"as you said, there is arelevant cost of action.",3783.41,2.18
"Congress has provided asubstantive right, as you say,",3785.59,2.333
that is not to be discriminatedagainst on the basis,3787.923,2.167
of your race.,3790.09,1.17
And then it has provided acause of action for someone,3791.26,2.46
to seek enforcementof that right,3793.72,1.62
if that right has been violated.,3795.34,1.648
The relevant differencehere is that ICWA doesn't,3796.988,2.042
provide the cause of action.,3799.03,1.35
"And instead, it sits ontop of existing state law",3800.38,2.94
"causes of action, andit tells state judges",3803.32,2.49
how to decide those cases.,3805.81,1.395
"MERRICK GARLAND: Well, becausewouldn't the other statute",3807.205,2.375
tell state judges theycan't discriminate,3809.58,1.75
in their decision makingagainst African-Americans?,3811.33,2.622
That's what the statute says.,3813.952,1.208
State judges maynot discriminate,3815.16,2.59
in their decision makingagainst African-Americans.,3817.75,3.69
"And if they do, thenjust as in this case,",3821.44,3.84
"the intervener, thetribe, can object",3825.28,3.09
that's what's happened here.,3828.37,1.99
"KELSEY FRAZIER: Yes, Your Honor.",3830.36,2.6
It's my understandingthough that that statute,3832.96,2.43
would essentiallybe a restatement,3835.39,4.22
of a constitutional principle.,3839.61,1.525
And the procedures that arebeing followed in these cases,3841.135,2.375
are otherwiseconstitutionally sufficient.,3843.51,2.293
MERRICK GARLAND: Nowwe're slipping back,3845.803,1.667
to the question of whetherthere's plenary power.,3847.47,3.52
"For purposes of this hypo, we'llassume there's plenary power,",3850.99,3.29
you offered that up.,3854.28,1.11
"So if there isplenary power, now we",3855.39,2.16
get to the next question.,3857.55,1.95
And Congress has thepower to act with respect,3859.5,3.36
"to this kind ofmember of a tribe,",3862.86,3.21
or possible member of a tribe.,3866.07,3.57
"Aren't those twoseparate questions,",3869.64,1.5
whether Congress has the power?,3871.14,2.04
I appreciate that in myexample maybe the power,3873.18,3.24
comes from the 14th Amendment.,3876.42,3.56
But if the power comesfrom the Indian Commerce,3879.98,3.76
"Clause for purposes of thehypo, why is it any different?",3883.74,3.695
"KELSEY FRAZIER:Well, Your Honor,",3887.435,1.375
this court has treated statutespassed under the 14th Amendment,3888.81,3.21
"differently from statutespassed under the, if you will,",3892.02,3.733
original provisionsof the Constitution.,3895.753,1.667
Because the 14th Amendmenthas been understood,3897.42,1.917
"to change the federal statebalance and, in some cases,",3899.337,2.853
to allow laws thatwould otherwise,3902.19,2.31
be considered commandeering.,3904.5,1.763
"The example, you provide,I believe is quite similar",3906.263,2.167
"to the Multi-ethnicPlacement Act,",3908.43,2.04
which is an act Congresspassed that said courts,3910.47,2.58
should not consider a race of--,3913.05,2.28
I believe it's theparents in that act,3915.33,1.74
in adoption proceedings.,3917.07,1.41
"But that's actually aconditional funding scheme,",3918.48,2.49
which recognizes thatCongress apparently,3920.97,3.06
thought it did not have thepower to pass that statute.,3924.03,2.552
MICHELLE FRIEDLAND :But isn't ICWA also?,3926.582,1.708
There is funding inthe Social Security Act,3928.29,3.06
"that contingent on statesfollowing ICWA, isn't there?",3931.35,4.217
"KELSEY FRAZIER: There is,Your Honor, in title 4B.",3935.567,2.083
But ICWA is not aconditional funding scheme.,3937.65,2.04
ICWA is a law that bindsthe states regardless of,3939.69,3.482
whether or not they'rereceiving funding.,3943.172,1.708
The Social Security Act providesadditional funding to states,3944.88,3.21
if they comply with ICWA.,3948.09,1.8
"But if states were toforgo that funding,",3949.89,1.98
they're still bound byICWA's requirements.,3951.87,2.43
MICHELLE FRIEDLAND : Butdid Ames forgo that funding?,3954.3,2.48
"KELSEY FRAZIER:Your Honor, I don't",3956.78,0.97
believe we have in therecord whether Ames,3957.75,1.75
has forgone that funding.,3959.5,1.137
But I don't believethe answer to that,3960.637,1.583
question is dispositive here.,3962.22,2.25
"Ames is still bound by ICWAand, as far as we know,",3964.47,3.28
"has complied with ICWA, orat least try to comply with.",3967.75,2.45
Certainly in this case they did.,3970.2,2.187
The difference betweena conditional funding,3972.387,1.833
"scheme and ICWA, alaw that's binding,",3974.22,3.45
is that the statehas the choice not,3977.67,2.37
to regulate in the waythe federal government has,3980.04,2.1
asked it to regulate.,3982.14,1.32
"That is, in a conditionalfunding scheme,",3983.46,1.8
the state can chooseto regulate according,3985.26,2.49
to the federalgovernment's preferences.,3987.75,1.83
But it doesn't have to.,3989.58,1.35
And that means that thestate remains politically,3990.93,2.13
accountable to its citizens.,3993.06,1.74
If the citizens don't likethat the state is or is not,3994.8,2.49
"complying, they can seek toelect different officials who",3997.29,3.75
will or will not comply.,4001.04,1.47
They can't do that here.,4002.51,1.29
Ames has no control over whetheror not it complies with ICWA.,4003.8,2.622
MERRICK GARLAND:I'm still thinking,4006.422,1.458
on this question of whyit matters that it's,4007.88,3.35
"a federal cause of action, ascompared to a federal defense,",4011.23,4.78
or a right that can beasserted by intervention.,4016.01,3.63
So imagine that astate wants to hold--,4019.64,6.75
not California.,4026.39,1.43
If a state wants to hold automanufacturers to a higher,4027.82,3.73
"standard than thefederal standard,",4031.55,3.51
the federal standard preemptingthat higher standard.,4035.06,5.63
"And then the state says,well, we don't care.",4040.69,2.42
"You can't stop us, you didn'tcreate a cause of action.",4043.11,3.24
We are going to prosecute thisauto manufacturer in this state,4046.35,5.97
for not meeting thehigher standard.,4052.32,1.8
"And at that point,not as a cause",4054.12,1.89
"of action but as a defense,the manufacturer says,",4056.01,3.33
"well, you can't do that.",4059.34,1.71
Your statute is preempted.,4061.05,2.58
"Only in that respect, you canhave all kinds of procedures",4063.63,4.26
"you want about enforcingpollution controls,",4067.89,2.31
but you can't have that one.,4070.2,2.47
"First of all, do you thinkthat would be commandeering?",4072.67,2.645
"KELSEY FRAZIER: I don't,Your Honor, assuming",4075.315,1.875
that the federalgovernment properly had,4077.19,1.41
the power to regulate there.,4078.6,1.32
"MERRICK GARLAND:Right, so assume here",4079.92,1.02
that the federalgovernment has that power.,4080.94,1.968
Because I want to hone youin only on the commandeering,4082.908,2.292
question.,4085.2,0.5
Why is that different?,4085.7,0.917
"KELSEY FRAZIER:Well, Your Honor,",4086.617,1.375
it's my understandingthat in that case,4087.992,1.648
the reason the federal statutegoverns and does not commandeer,4089.64,3.93
is that there essentiallyis no state cause of action,4093.57,2.76
because the federallaw has replaced it.,4096.33,2.683
"And the federal law,which acts directly",4099.013,1.667
"upon the automanufacturers presumably,",4100.68,2.88
is not commandeering.,4103.56,1.049
It's not tellingthe state courts,4104.609,1.201
how to decide their cases.,4105.81,1.23
"Instead, it's just sayingthe federal government",4107.04,2.43
has determined that our lawsgoverning these actions.,4109.47,2.272
And so there is nostate cause of action.,4111.742,1.708
MERRICK GARLAND: Why isn'tthe federal government,4113.45,2.042
replaced the normal preferencesof the state of Ames family,4115.492,3.518
law?,4119.01,0.679
It's just replaced them.,4119.689,1.109
"KELSEY FRAZIER: Your Honor,the federal government here",4120.798,2.292
is replacing the way thatthe state judges decide how,4123.09,4.65
"to place children, certainly.",4127.74,1.77
But the proceeding itselfis under state law.,4129.51,2.11
"Again, ICWA itselftells us this.",4131.62,2.366
The federal governmenthas not created,4133.986,1.583
a federal cause of action.,4135.569,1.171
"And indeed, itprobably could not",4136.74,1.69
"because as we began ourdiscussion by saying,",4138.43,2.03
family law is typically withinthe nearly exclusive province,4140.46,3.84
of the states.,4144.3,1.349
"This court hasrecognized a principle,",4145.649,2.491
that the federal law takes thestate courts as it finds them.,4148.14,2.953
AMUL THAPAR: So are you sayingthey can never get involved,4151.093,2.417
with American Indian children?,4153.51,3.165
"KELSEY FRAZIER: The federalgovernment, Your Honor?",4156.675,2.125
"AMUL THAPAR: Yes, and any typeof preferences related to them.",4158.8,3.238
KELSEY FRAZIER: YourHonor we believe,4162.038,1.542
that the federal law couldask the states to apply,4163.58,2.97
"these similarpreferences through,",4166.55,1.42
"for example, a conditionalfunding scheme.",4167.97,1.953
And we believe--,4169.923,0.667
"AMUL THAPAR: But they can'tthrough their plenary power,",4170.59,1.689
is your point.,4172.279,0.84
"KELSEY FRAZIER: Theycould regulate, perhaps,",4173.119,3.001
"family law throughtheir plenary powers,",4176.12,2.26
though this court has neversaid that the Indian Affairs,4178.38,3.17
"power extends, or thatthe Indian Commerce Clause",4181.55,2.7
power extends to family law.,4184.25,1.93
AMUL THAPAR: What if a state--,4186.18,1.25
I'm sorry to interrupt you.,4187.43,1.125
What if a state used exclusivelyprivate adoption services?,4188.555,4.5
"KELSEY FRAZIER: Your Honor, thatwould be a much more difficult",4193.055,2.625
"question, admittedly,because then we",4195.68,1.64
would be asking essentiallya question about how,4197.32,3.31
this law is best read.,4200.63,2.43
"First of all, that'snot the situation here.",4203.06,2.91
Adoption is typicallydone by the states.,4205.97,1.95
"But under this hypothetical,it might be the case",4207.92,3.48
that a law could be best read asregulating private actors if we,4211.4,3.99
knew that a significantpercentage of adoptions,4215.39,2.61
were performed by privateactors in the states.,4218.0,2.2
We might also lookat the activity,4220.2,1.61
itself and ask whether that'ssomething that the states have,4221.81,2.67
traditionally done.,4224.48,1.29
"Indeed, that was alittle bit closer",4225.77,1.5
"to the inquiry in theReno and Baker cases,",4227.27,2.31
the cases that found the lawsto be generally applicable.,4229.58,4.05
Those cases were concerned notso much with the percentage,4233.63,2.7
"breakdown of who wasperforming activities,",4236.33,2.79
but with what the activitywas and how the states were,4239.12,2.43
being regulated.,4241.55,0.84
"So in the Reno case forexample, the government",4242.39,2.52
upheld this lawgoverning how states,4244.91,3.27
treat private informationcollected from drivers.,4248.18,3.81
Because it was alaw that regulated,4251.99,1.86
states acting essentiallylike private entities.,4253.85,2.76
And specificallybecause it was not,4256.61,3.9
"a law that regulated how statesregulate private individuals,",4260.51,3.69
or that it requiredstates to implement,4264.2,1.98
a federal regulatory program.,4266.18,2.31
ICWA is all about how statesregulate private individuals.,4268.49,2.417
MICHELLE FRIEDLAND : I'd liketo go back to your answer.,4270.907,2.333
I think you saidthis could be done,4273.24,1.79
through conditionalspending legislation.,4275.03,2.05
"But I'm confused, wouldn'tyou say there'd still",4277.08,2.0
be an equal protection problem?,4279.08,1.32
"AL KELLEY: We would, Your Honor.",4280.4,0.72
"I amend my statement,that was just",4281.12,1.59
with regard to theanti-commandeering concern.,4282.71,2.76
We believe that theanti-commandeering concern,4285.47,1.932
would be remedied if thiswere a conditional spending,4287.402,2.208
"program, again, because then thestate maintains the decision of",4289.61,3.18
whether or not itwishes to comply,4292.79,1.98
and thus remainremains politically,4294.77,1.65
accountable to its citizens.,4296.42,1.497
"MICHELLE FRIEDLAND : So sorry,going back to this hypothetical",4297.917,2.583
where a state has justprivate adoption agencies.,4300.5,2.765
KELSEY FRAZIER: Yes.,4303.265,0.942
MICHELLE FRIEDLAND : Ihave trouble seeing how you,4304.207,2.083
have a commandeering problem.,4306.29,1.208
I know you'll say somethingabout maybe the state courts,4307.498,2.555
that the adoption agencieswould need to go through.,4310.053,2.167
But I have troubleseeing how there,4312.22,1.963
aren't all kinds of federal lawsthat state courts have to apply,4314.183,2.667
and that have that--,4316.85,1.05
it's a much harderpart of your argument.,4317.9,1.77
"KELSEY FRAZIER: YourHonor, that certainly",4319.67,1.41
would be a much harder case ifprivate adoption agencies were,4321.08,2.7
doing all of the work.,4323.78,2.035
The only way that would looklike a commandeering problem,4325.815,2.375
"is if we think about theactivity being regulated,",4328.19,2.19
and whether that'ssomething that is typically,4330.38,2.13
"left to the states,and the states",4332.51,1.417
are choosing toessentially contract out.,4333.927,2.033
But that raises questionsabout state delegation,4335.96,2.37
to private entities thataren't at issue here.,4338.33,2.79
"Here, states are primarilyperforming the functions",4341.12,2.7
that ICWA regulates.,4343.82,1.29
"That is true of adoption,but many of the functions",4345.11,2.43
that ICWA regulates are actuallythings only states can perform.,4347.54,3.45
"For example, all of thestate court proceedings.",4350.99,2.43
None of that could bedone by private actor.,4353.42,2.53
And even some of the provisionsthat impose obligations,4355.95,3.41
on the state executiveagencies appear,4359.36,2.437
that they might be right toapply to private actors too.,4361.797,2.333
But really applyprimarily to state actors.,4364.13,3.03
"For example, 1912D, which is theactive efforts provision, which",4367.16,4.32
is one that is mostcommandeering insofar as it,4371.48,2.64
requires child protectiveservices officers,4374.12,3.0
"to take active efforts, whichare affirmative efforts to--",4377.12,2.712
MICHELLE FRIEDLAND : Thatprovision wasn't implicated,4379.832,2.208
"in this case at all, was it?",4382.04,1.633
I'm a little unclear how youcan challenge that provision.,4383.673,2.417
KELSEY FRAZIER: It wasn'timplicated in this case,4386.09,2.55
"under the facts of this case,but it should have been.",4388.64,2.76
Because CJ Is an Indianchild within the definition,4391.4,3.45
"of ICWA and CJ was removedfrom his biological mother,",4394.85,4.14
AW's home.,4398.99,1.02
"Now, because thestate did not know",4400.01,1.83
"that CJ was an Indianchild, it did not have",4401.84,2.46
it did not comply with 1912D.,4404.3,2.46
"But had it known,the state would",4406.76,1.53
"have had to take active efforts,those are affirmative actions,",4408.29,3.27
to prevent thebreakup of the family,4411.56,2.16
before it could removeCJ from his home.,4413.72,3.87
"Again, it didn't hearbecause it wasn't aware,",4417.59,2.31
which simply highlights thatthis provision is applying even,4419.9,3.12
"to children who do not havean existing tribal connection,",4423.02,3.748
"and who are not eligiblemembers, or the children",4426.768,2.042
of eligible members.,4428.81,1.352
For the foregoingreasons we respectfully,4430.162,1.708
request this court affirm.,4431.87,1.986
[APPLAUSE],4433.856,1.992
"AL KELLEY: Mr. Chief Justice,a few brief points in response.",4447.32,3.18
"First, on the EqualProtection issue,",4450.5,1.92
respondents proposed heretoday several limitations,4452.42,2.94
that this court should place onthe application of the Mancari,4455.36,3.27
Rational Relationship Test.,4458.63,1.5
But none of theselimitations follow,4460.13,2.16
from this court'sopinion in Mancari,4462.29,1.8
or any of its subsequentapplications of that test.,4464.09,3.21
"First, respondentsargued that there",4467.3,3.09
should be a limitation basedon whether a statute deals,4470.39,2.7
with tribal self-government.,4473.09,1.53
"But as this court madeclear in Antelope,",4474.62,2.52
tribal self-governmentis only one way,4477.14,2.01
for a statute to be rationallytied to Congress's fulfillment,4479.15,3.96
of its trust obligations.,4483.11,1.44
And subsequent cases like theWashington commercial passenger,4484.55,3.42
fishing vessel caseonly dealt with statutes,4487.97,3.63
"that had, if any connectionto tribal self-government,",4491.6,2.4
a very tenuous one there.,4494.0,1.2
It was a grant offishing rights.,4495.2,1.99
And so this isn't a limitationthat this court has recognized,4497.19,3.59
previously on the Mancari Test.,4500.78,1.78
"But even if it was,ICWA satisfies this test",4502.56,3.77
because it clearly servestribal self-government,4506.33,2.52
by giving tribes the rightto intervene in proceedings,4508.85,2.55
and by indeedensuring that tribes,4511.4,1.71
have the membership to continueas self-governing entities.,4513.11,4.05
And respondents also argued thatMancari should be limited only,4517.16,3.21
to enrolled members.,4520.37,0.96
MERRICK GARLAND: Can I ask howsending an Indian child who,4521.33,5.73
is eligible for onetribe to another tribe,4527.06,3.24
across the country maintainstribal self-government,4530.3,3.535
with the first tribe?,4533.835,2.087
"AL KELLEY: Well, YourHonor, it maintains",4535.922,1.708
tribal self-governmentbecause it,4537.63,1.5
ensures that those childrengrow up in Indian culture,4539.13,3.36
and therefore are more likelyto form a political relationship,4542.49,4.11
"with their tribe, theirown tribe later on,",4546.6,2.76
having grown upin a society that,4549.36,1.83
has respect for thatkind of political bond.,4551.19,2.85
"Now, turning to theanti-commandeering issue,",4554.04,2.88
respondents argue that ICWAcommandeers state courts.,4556.92,3.78
But requiring state judgesto apply different burdens,4560.7,3.39
and standards hasnever been understood,4564.09,1.89
to implicate theanti-commandeering doctrine.,4565.98,1.94
It's a straightforwardapplication,4567.92,1.65
of the supremacy clause.,4569.57,1.0
AMUL THAPAR: What about theactive efforts provision?,4570.57,2.208
That's the one theymainly object to.,4572.778,1.862
AL KELLEY: So theactive efforts provision,4574.64,1.75
is of general application.,4576.39,1.62
Section 1912Dapplies to any party,4578.01,3.39
who seeks to affect the fosterplacement of an Indian child,4581.4,3.19
or a removal of thatchild from their parents.,4584.59,3.5
And thus it's close to what thiscourt faced in Reno v Condon.,4588.09,3.86
And it similarly is a grantof a right to those children,4591.95,3.55
to only be removed from theirhomes and to the parents,4595.5,2.58
to only have theirchildren removed when,4598.08,2.58
active efforts have been made.,4600.66,1.47
So it's a condition and alimitation on state action,4602.13,3.33
rather than anaffirmative order.,4605.46,1.45
It only comes into play whenthe state decides to remove,4606.91,3.29
a child from their home.,4610.2,1.33
So what respondentsare asking for here,4611.53,1.97
is not an application of theanti-commandeering doctrine,4613.5,2.73
but an extension of it farbeyond what this court has,4616.23,3.0
recognized in its past cases.,4619.23,2.19
"For those reasons we ask thatthis court reverse, thank you.",4621.42,3.416
[APPLAUSE],4624.836,2.39
"MERRICK GARLAND:No surprise, we'll",4636.83,1.48
be taking this matterunder submission.,4638.31,2.61
And if you'll give us recess.,4640.92,1.95
SPEAKER 1: All rise.,4642.87,0.84
[APPLAUSE],4666.572,1.988
Round of applause.,4668.56,0.994
All rise.,4680.52,0.63
Please be seated.,4701.5,2.712
MERRICK GARLAND:And come to order.,4704.212,1.458
"OK, in the matter of theAmes Moot Court final round,",4710.67,3.945
the decision of thejudges is as follows.,4714.615,3.655
"Best briefs, the petitioners.",4718.27,3.09
You can applaud.,4721.36,1.92
[APPLAUSE],4723.28,1.92

[APPLAUSE],4736.733,2.455
"Best team, respondents.",4747.044,3.306
[APPLAUSE],4750.35,2.475
"Now, does the Dean wantus to do something else?",4772.59,2.0
"You don't know, OK.",4778.19,0.84
SPEAKER 1: You know what to do.,4779.03,1.305
"MERRICK GARLAND: Well,there was some reference",4780.335,1.958
to a brief discussionabout oral argument.,4782.293,3.577
Is that correct?,4785.87,1.46
"Oh, you have something to say.",4787.33,3.165
MICHELLE FRIEDLAND: So should we,4790.495,1.657
not make comments about them?,4792.152,1.208
"SPEAKER 1: So yeah, makesome brief comments here",4793.36,1.26
to the oralists.,4794.62,0.76
And then we willrecess here and then,4795.38,1.61
do private commentary later.,4796.99,1.572
"MICHELLE FRIEDLAND : OK,so I thought all of you",4798.562,7.788
were tremendously excellent.,4806.35,3.09
I wish that I had advocateslike you in court all the time.,4809.44,3.78
"I occasionally have peoplealmost as good as you guys,",4813.22,2.67
but not usually.,4815.89,1.36
And it was really wonderfulto watch all of you,4817.25,3.38
and to be able to be hereand to be a part of this.,4820.63,2.89
You did extraordinarily well.,4823.52,2.43
I think you all had theidea that you were really,4825.95,2.78
"answering questions,you were really",4828.73,1.5
listening to our questions.,4830.23,1.17
You stayed very calm.,4831.4,2.38
You were really just excellent.,4833.78,2.88
Should we save individualremarks for later?,4836.66,2.9
OK.,4839.56,0.96
"I will make a pitch though,since I have this opportunity",4840.52,3.063
"to tell you that, in theNinth Circuit, if you",4843.583,1.917
take up a pro bono case you areguaranteed an oral argument.,4845.5,3.665
I hope that I willsee all of you,4849.165,1.375
in my court in the near future.,4850.54,3.63
"AMUL THAPAR: We try to dothe same in the Sixth, so.",4854.17,3.083
"MERRICK GARLAND: Allright, we'll do the same.",4857.253,1.917
"But only to the people in thisroom, don't tell anybody else.",4861.97,4.98
AMUL THAPAR: That'sa pro-Harvard bias.,4866.95,4.33
MERRICK GARLAND: Good point.,4871.28,2.11
"Yeah, it requiresstrict scrutiny, though.",4873.39,2.15
There's compelling interest.,4875.54,2.75
I second everything thatJudge Friedland said.,4878.29,2.91
"I thought this wasreally terrific,",4881.2,1.62
both the briefs and the oralarguments were quite amazing,4882.82,3.05
and up to the highestprofessional standards,4885.87,2.41
that we see.,4888.28,1.47
"And I'll just say,just a tiny addition",4889.75,3.57
to what Judge Friedlandsaid about the nature,4893.32,3.93
of the discussion.,4897.25,0.93
"So for me, the thingabout oral argument",4898.18,3.36
is it should be adiscussion with the judge.,4901.54,3.3
"It should not be, I'vegot these 25 points",4904.84,3.93
"and I have to get them--get through them, regardless",4908.77,2.55
of whether those are thequestions the judges are asking,4911.32,3.42
or not.,4914.74,0.92
And all of you didthis extremely well.,4915.66,1.9
"That is, when weasked a question,",4917.56,1.47
you diverged fromwhatever else you thought,4919.03,1.98
your business was going to be.,4921.01,2.14
And you answered the question.,4923.15,2.18
And then we could move on.,4925.33,3.52
Questions are not to be feared.,4931.51,3.54
The whole point inoral argument is,4935.05,1.86
you want to know what isbothering the judge so you,4936.91,2.94
can fix that problem.,4939.85,3.61
"We gave you the Supreme Court'snew innovation a little bit,",4943.46,4.14
"which is that you get acouple of minutes, two",4947.6,2.21
minutes at the very beginning.,4949.81,2.37
But very few courts give youthat two minutes anymore.,4952.18,2.82
And I'll be very surprisedif the Supreme Court doesn't,4955.0,3.9
deteriorate with respectto those two minutes,4958.9,2.19
and people start askingquestions before.,4961.09,3.25
"And you should want that,you should want to know--",4964.34,3.44
"not from court purposes,but from the point of view",4967.78,3.15
"of being an advocate, you wantto know, what is your weakness,",4970.93,2.67
and can I explain it?,4973.6,2.13
"And you all did that,I thought it was great.",4975.73,1.88
"AMUL THAPAR: Yeah, Ithought it was exceptional.",4977.61,2.0
I agree with everythingthey both said.,4979.61,1.625
"The one thing I'll say forpeople that have never done it,",4981.235,2.565
"it's incrediblyhard to stand there,",4983.8,3.12
I think almostuniversally without notes,4986.92,2.04
or without looking down.,4988.96,1.14
"Look us in the eye,answer the questions.",4990.1,2.31
"We'll come up with questionsthat are sometimes crazy,",4992.41,3.24
"or try to throw you off orturn you a different way,",4995.65,3.87
and all four of you did anexceptional job of just staying,4999.52,3.84
"the course, answering thequestions, making sure you",5003.36,3.33
answered the question.,5006.69,1.23
"And then weavingit, like, seamlessly",5007.92,3.81
back into your argument.,5011.73,1.05
"Right into the case law,right into everything.",5012.78,2.285
Even if we askedyou a completely,5015.065,1.375
"off the wall question, you'dmake it sound reasonable",5016.44,2.79
"and weave it rightback in, which",5019.23,1.89
"is really a masterfulskill, and something",5021.12,3.48
I commend you all for.,5024.6,0.975
And I hope you will cometo the Sixth Circuit,5025.575,1.875
"first, because it's closer.",5027.45,1.125
SPEAKER 1: And if we couldgive one more round of applause,5030.973,2.417
for our competitorsand our judges.,5033.39,2.926
[APPLAUSE],5036.316,2.46
If everyone would rise.,5049.61,2.5
