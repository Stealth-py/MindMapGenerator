the following is a conversation with,0.08,4.719
elon musk his third time on this the lex,1.52,5.44
friedman podcast,4.799,4.481
yeah make yourself comfortable oh,6.96,4.4
no wow okay no no,9.28,4.8
you don't do the headphone thing no okay,11.36,4.0
i mean how close do i get need to get,14.08,2.72
this thing the closer you are the sexier,15.36,3.999
you sound hey babe yeah can't get enough,16.8,5.76
of the what y'all that baby,19.359,3.201
i'm gonna clip that out anytime somebody,23.039,5.201
messages me about it,25.76,5.12
and you think i'm sexy come right out,28.24,5.6
and tell me so,30.88,2.96
so good okay,38.8,5.04
serious mode activate all right,40.48,4.72
mode come on you're russian you can be,43.84,2.239
serious,45.2,2.0
everyone's serious all the time in,46.079,2.401
russia yeah,47.2,2.72
yeah,48.48,3.68
we'll get there we'll get there,49.92,5.2
yeah it's gotten soft,52.16,2.96
allow me to say that the spacex launch,55.199,4.801
of human beings to orbit on may 30th,57.6,4.4
2020,60.0,4.0
was seen by many as the first step in a,62.0,5.28
new era of human space exploration,64.0,5.36
these human space flight missions were a,67.28,4.24
beacon of hope to me and to millions,69.36,4.079
over the past two years is our world has,71.52,3.52
been going through one of the most,73.439,3.121
difficult periods in recent human,75.04,2.88
history,76.56,4.239
we saw we see the rise of division fear,77.92,6.64
cynicism and the loss of common humanity,80.799,6.801
right when it is needed most so first,84.56,4.879
elon let me say thank you for giving the,87.6,3.519
world hope and reason to be excited,89.439,3.68
about the future oh it's kind of you to,91.119,2.96
say it,93.119,4.0
i do want to do that humanity has uh,94.079,6.08
obviously a lot of issues and and uh you,97.119,5.36
know people at times do do bad things,100.159,3.121
but,102.479,1.68
you know,103.28,3.36
despite all that um you know i love,104.159,4.881
humanity and i think we should,106.64,4.32
uh,109.04,3.439
make sure we do everything we can to,110.96,3.04
have a good future and an exciting,112.479,3.841
future and one where that maximizes the,114.0,4.159
happiness of the people,116.32,4.56
let me ask about uh crew dragon demo two,118.159,4.64
so that that first flight with humans on,120.88,3.36
board,122.799,2.881
how did you feel leading up to that,124.24,3.84
launch were you scared are you excited,125.68,4.639
what's going through your mind so much,128.08,4.879
was at stake,130.319,2.64
yeah no that was extremely stressful no,133.92,3.2
question,136.239,2.72
we obviously could not,137.12,2.72
um,138.959,4.881
let them down in any way um so,139.84,4.0
extremely stressful i'd say,143.92,3.6
uh to say the least,145.68,2.8
but we did,147.52,2.64
i was confident that at the time that we,148.48,3.52
launched that,150.16,4.64
no one could think of anything,152.0,5.36
at all to do that would improve the,154.8,4.64
probability of success,157.36,5.04
um and we we racked our brains to think,159.44,4.24
of any possible way to improve the,162.4,2.72
probability of success we could not,163.68,3.919
think of anything more and and nor could,165.12,3.72
nasa and,167.599,3.36
so then that that's just the best that,168.84,4.759
we could do so then we we had,170.959,4.64
we went ahead and launched,173.599,4.64
now i'm not a religious person,175.599,5.28
um but i nonetheless got on my knees and,178.239,5.441
prayed for that mission,180.879,4.881
you able to sleep,183.68,3.76
no,185.76,3.28
how did it feel,187.44,3.68
when it was a success first when the,189.04,4.0
launch was a success and when they,191.12,5.6
returned back home or back to earth,193.04,6.8
it was a great relief,196.72,3.12
yeah,200.239,3.601
it's for high stress situations i find,201.599,4.881
it's not so much elation as relief,203.84,4.56
um,206.48,3.2
and um,208.4,2.8
you know i think once,209.68,3.68
as as we we got more comfortable and,211.2,4.16
improved out the systems because you,213.36,4.0
know we really,215.36,3.12
um,217.36,2.159
you know you got to make sure everything,218.48,2.399
works um,219.519,3.041
i was it was definitely a lot more,220.879,3.761
enjoyable with the subsequent uh,222.56,3.84
astronaut uh missions,224.64,4.0
and i thought the,226.4,4.16
the inspiration mission was was actually,228.64,4.0
very inspiring um the inspiration for,230.56,4.48
mission um i'd encourage people to watch,232.64,3.2
the,235.04,2.559
inspiration documentary on netflix it's,235.84,5.119
actually really good um and it really,237.599,4.961
isn't so i i was actually inspired by,240.959,5.601
that um and i i i so that one i felt i i,242.56,6.16
was kind of able to enjoy the the actual,246.56,3.679
mission and not just be super stressed,248.72,3.92
all the time so for people that somehow,250.239,5.36
don't know it's the all civilian first,252.64,3.76
time,255.599,3.6
all civilian out to space out to orbit,256.4,5.6
yeah it was the high i think the highest,259.199,5.761
orbit that uh in like under 30 or 40,262.0,4.72
years or something the only one that was,264.96,2.72
higher,266.72,3.919
was the one shuttle sorry a hubble uh,267.68,4.4
servicing mission,270.639,2.881
um and then before that it would have,272.08,5.52
been um apollo in 72.,273.52,5.52
it's pretty wild,277.6,3.68
so it's cool it's good you know i think,279.04,4.56
uh as you know,281.28,4.4
as a species like we want to be,283.6,3.76
you know continuing to,285.68,3.92
do better and and reach higher ground,287.36,4.559
and and like i think it would be tragic,289.6,5.039
extremely tragic if um apollo was the,291.919,4.961
high water mark for humanity you know,294.639,3.601
and that then that's as far as we ever,296.88,3.12
got,298.24,3.76
and it's um,300.0,5.44
it's concerning that here we are um,302.0,5.68
49 years after the last mission to the,305.44,4.319
moon,307.68,4.079
it's almost half a century,309.759,4.241
uh and we've not been back,311.759,3.761
um and that's,314.0,3.44
that's worrying it's like is that,315.52,3.2
does that mean,317.44,3.44
we've peaked as a civilization or what,318.72,3.84
so,320.88,3.12
like i think we got to get back to the,322.56,3.76
moon and build a base there you know a,324.0,3.84
science base i think we could learn a,326.32,3.439
lot about the nature of the universe if,327.84,3.359
we have a proper science base on the,329.759,2.241
moon,331.199,3.28
um you know like we have a science based,332.0,4.639
in antarctica and you know many other,334.479,4.401
parts of the world and,336.639,4.321
um so that that that's like i think the,338.88,4.56
next big thing we've got to have like a,340.96,5.2
serious like moon base um and then get,343.44,5.039
people to mars and,346.16,4.4
you know get get out there and,348.479,3.921
be a space bearing civilization,350.56,3.84
i'll ask you about some of those details,352.4,4.56
but since you're so busy with the hard,354.4,4.079
engineering challenges,356.96,3.359
of everything that's involved,358.479,3.201
are you still able to marvel at the,360.319,4.0
magic of it all of space travel,361.68,4.079
of every time the rocket goes up,364.319,3.6
especially when it's a crude mission,365.759,4.801
or you're just so overwhelmed with the,367.919,3.921
all the challenges that you have to,370.56,2.8
solve,371.84,4.24
and actually sort of to add to that,373.36,4.399
the reason i want to ask this question,376.08,4.8
of may 30th it's it's been some time so,377.759,4.641
you can look back and think about the,380.88,4.0
impact already it's already at the time,382.4,5.04
it was an engineering problem maybe now,384.88,4.48
it's becoming a historic moment like,387.44,3.36
it's a moment that,389.36,2.72
how many moments would be remembered,390.8,4.72
about the 21st century to me,392.08,5.28
that or something like that maybe,395.52,3.679
inspiration for one of those would be,397.36,3.839
remembered as the early steps of a new,399.199,4.881
age of uh space exploration,401.199,5.28
yeah i mean during the launches itself,404.08,4.48
so i mean i think i think maybe some,406.479,3.44
people know but a lot of people don't,408.56,2.479
know it's like i'm actually the chief,409.919,2.881
engineer of spacex so,411.039,2.72
um,412.8,1.839
the,413.759,2.801
you know i've signed off on pretty much,414.639,3.68
all the design decisions,416.56,3.44
um and,418.319,4.241
you know so if there's something that,420.0,4.96
goes wrong with that,422.56,4.16
vehicle it's it's fundamentally my fault,424.96,2.959
you know so,426.72,2.96
um,427.919,4.801
so i'm really just thinking,429.68,4.959
about all the things that like so so,432.72,3.28
when i see the rocket i see all the,434.639,2.721
things that could go wrong and the,436.0,3.44
things that could be better and the same,437.36,5.279
with the dragon spacecraft it's like,439.44,4.96
other people say oh this is a,442.639,3.521
spacecraft or a rocket and this looks,444.4,3.44
really cool i'm like,446.16,3.759
i've like a readout of like this is the,447.84,3.52
these are these are the risks these are,449.919,5.201
the pro the problems that's what i see,451.36,3.76
so it's,456.16,3.039
not what other people see when they see,457.759,3.681
the product you know so let me uh ask,459.199,4.0
you then to analyze starship in that,461.44,4.319
same way i know you have you'll talk,463.199,4.801
about in more detail about starship in,465.759,4.481
the near future perhaps yeah talk about,468.0,4.639
it now if you want um but just in that,470.24,4.72
same way like you said you see when you,472.639,3.921
see up,474.96,3.12
when you see a rocket you see a sort of,476.56,3.6
a list of risks in that same way you,478.08,3.76
said that starship is a really hard,480.16,3.039
problem,481.84,4.479
so there's many ways i can ask this but,483.199,5.361
if you magically could solve one problem,486.319,4.241
perfectly one engineering problem,488.56,5.44
perfectly which one would it be on sasha,490.56,5.919
on sorry on starship so is it maybe,494.0,4.72
related to the efficiency the,496.479,4.0
uh the engine the weight of the,498.72,3.199
different components the complexity of,500.479,3.681
various things maybe the controls of the,501.919,4.96
the crazy thing has to do to land no,504.16,5.599
it's actually the by far the the biggest,506.879,5.52
thing absorbing my time is uh,509.759,5.28
uh engine production,512.399,5.601
not not the design of the engine but,515.039,5.841
i've often said prototypes are,518.0,6.56
are easy production is hard,520.88,3.68
so,525.279,3.281
we have the most advanced rocket engine,526.0,6.08
that's ever been designed um,528.56,5.44
the because i say currently the the best,532.08,4.56
rocket engine ever is probably the rd,534.0,6.16
180 or rd-170 the um,536.64,5.84
that that's the russian engine basically,540.16,3.44
um,542.48,2.24
and um,543.6,2.799
and still i think an engine should only,544.72,3.36
count if it's gotten something to orbit,546.399,2.481
um,548.08,2.96
so our engine has not gotten anything to,548.88,3.28
orbit yet,551.04,3.44
um but it is it's the first engine,552.16,4.4
that's actually,554.48,4.799
better than than the the,556.56,4.399
russian rd engines which are,559.279,3.201
amazing design,560.959,3.041
so you're talking about raptor engine,562.48,3.6
what makes it amazing what what are the,564.0,4.32
different aspects of it that,566.08,4.4
make it like what are you the most,568.32,4.32
excited about uh if the whole thing,570.48,3.12
works,572.64,2.8
in terms of efficiency all those kinds,573.6,3.359
of things,575.44,2.8
well it's,576.959,3.121
the raptor is a,578.24,3.279
a full flow,580.08,3.52
uh staged combustion,581.519,4.241
um,583.6,4.08
engine and it's,585.76,3.759
operating at a very high chamber,587.68,3.04
pressure,589.519,3.841
so one of the key figures america,590.72,5.28
perhaps the key figure of merit is,593.36,3.44
um,596.0,2.88
what is the chamber pressure at which,596.8,4.24
the rocket engine can operate that's the,598.88,4.0
combustion chamber pressure,601.04,3.76
so a raptor is,602.88,4.72
designed to operate at 300 bar possibly,604.8,7.12
maybe higher that's 300 atmospheres so,607.6,5.76
um,611.92,3.44
the record right now for operational,613.36,3.84
engine is the rd engine that i mentioned,615.36,3.52
the russian rd which is i believe around,617.2,3.44
267,618.88,3.6
bar,620.64,4.319
and the the the difficulty of the,622.48,4.24
chamber pressure is increases on a,624.959,3.841
non-linear basis so,626.72,3.6
10 more,628.8,2.96
pressure is,630.32,2.8
more like uh,631.76,2.4
50,633.12,2.64
more difficult,634.16,2.64
um,635.76,3.12
but that that chain of pressure is that,636.8,4.0
that is what allows you to get a very,638.88,5.36
high uh power density,640.8,6.4
for the engine um so,644.24,5.68
uh enabling um,647.2,6.0
a very high thrust to weight ratio,649.92,4.159
and,653.2,3.68
a very high specific impulse,654.079,4.88
so specific impulse is like a measure of,656.88,4.639
the efficiency of a rocket engine or um,658.959,4.56
it's really the the,661.519,4.161
the uh,663.519,4.241
exhaust the effective exhaust velocity,665.68,4.8
of of the gas coming out of the engine,667.76,4.96
um,670.48,4.799
so uh,672.72,4.559
with a very high chamber pressure you,675.279,4.24
can have um,677.279,3.041
a,679.519,3.121
a compact engine that nonetheless has a,680.32,4.32
high expansion ratio which is the ratio,682.64,4.96
between the uh,684.64,4.4
exit nozzle,687.6,3.2
uh and the uh,689.04,3.919
throat so you know engine's got like you,690.8,3.44
see a rocket just got like sort of like,692.959,3.44
about like a hourglass shape it's like a,694.24,3.92
chamber and then it next down and,696.399,4.0
there's a nozzle and the ratio of the,698.16,5.52
the exit diameter to the,700.399,4.401
throat,703.68,3.279
expansion ratio so why is it such a hard,704.8,4.0
engine to manufacture,706.959,4.081
at scale,708.8,4.08
uh it's very complex,711.04,3.84
so a lot of what does complexity mean,712.88,3.68
here's a lot of components involved,714.88,3.759
there's a lot of a lot of components and,716.56,3.44
a lot of,718.639,3.601
uh unique materials,720.0,5.36
that so we had to invent a,722.24,5.839
several alloys that don't exist in order,725.36,5.279
to make this engine work,728.079,3.361
um,730.639,3.681
materials problem too,731.44,6.88
it's a materials problem and um it is in,734.32,6.0
a staged combustion a full flow stage,738.32,4.0
combustion there there are many uh,740.32,4.72
feedback loops in the system so,742.32,4.4
you uh,745.04,3.44
basically you've got,746.72,2.64
uh,748.48,3.2
propellant and and and uh hot gas,749.36,3.84
flowing,751.68,3.12
um,753.2,3.28
simultaneously to so many different,754.8,4.24
places on the engine,756.48,4.64
and,759.04,3.919
they all have a recursive effect on each,761.12,3.68
other so you change one thing here it,762.959,3.281
has a recursive effect here it changes,764.8,4.159
something over there and and it's,766.24,4.08
it's it's quite,768.959,3.68
hard to control um,770.32,3.6
like there's a reason no one's made this,772.639,3.521
before um,773.92,3.28
but,776.16,2.479
um,777.2,4.4
and the reason we're doing um a,778.639,4.88
stage combustion uh,781.6,3.039
full flow,783.519,3.841
is because it it has the highest uh the,784.639,4.0
highest uh,787.36,4.24
theoretical possible uh efficiency,788.639,4.0
um,791.6,2.239
so,792.639,4.481
in in in order to make a fully reusable,793.839,4.321
rocket,797.12,2.08
um,798.16,3.679
which that's the really the holy grail,799.2,6.079
of orbital rocketry um,801.839,4.881
you have to have,805.279,3.041
everything's got to be the best uh it's,806.72,3.6
got to be the best engine the best,808.32,5.04
airframe the best heat shield um,810.32,6.0
extremely light uh avionics,813.36,4.4
um,816.32,3.92
you know very clever control mechanisms,817.76,5.519
um you've got to shed mass in in any,820.24,6.0
possible way that you can um for example,823.279,4.481
instead of putting landing legs on the,826.24,3.039
booster and chip we are going to catch,827.76,3.68
them with a tower to save the weight of,829.279,3.441
the landing lens,831.44,3.519
legs so that's like,832.72,3.44
i mean,834.959,3.201
we're talking about catching,836.16,4.64
the largest flying object ever made,838.16,4.96
uh with,840.8,4.719
on a giant tower with with chopstick,843.12,3.279
arms,845.519,3.201
it's like karate kid with the fly but,846.399,4.88
much bigger,848.72,2.559
i mean pulling this probably,851.92,5.2
won't work the first time,854.079,4.88
uh and anyway so this is bananas this is,857.12,3.76
banana stuff so you mentioned that you,858.959,5.361
doubt well not you doubt but there,860.88,5.44
there's days or moments when you doubt,864.32,3.92
that this is even possible,866.32,6.4
it's so difficult the possible part is,868.24,6.719
well at this point,872.72,4.239
we'll i think we will get starship to,874.959,2.961
work,876.959,3.281
um,877.92,2.32
um there's a question of timing how long,880.399,4.88
will it take us to do this,883.04,3.599
how long will it take us to actually,885.279,5.041
achieve a full and rapid reusability,886.639,5.521
because it will take probably many,890.32,4.0
launches before we are able to have full,892.16,5.28
and rapid reusability,894.32,5.84
but i can't say that that the physics,897.44,8.0
pencils out like the like we're not uh,900.16,6.96
like at this point i'd say we're,905.44,3.44
confident that that,907.12,2.88
like let's say,908.88,3.6
i'm very confident success is in the set,910.0,5.44
of all possible outcomes,912.48,2.96
for a while there i was not convinced,916.399,3.601
that success was in the set of possible,918.24,3.44
outcomes,920.0,3.68
which is very important actually,921.68,6.159
but so um,923.68,4.159
saying there's a chance i'm saying,928.24,4.56
there's a chance exactly um,929.839,4.961
uh just not sure how,932.8,3.2
how how,934.8,3.2
long it will take uh,936.0,3.6
we're very very talented team they're,938.0,4.0
working night and day to make it happen,939.6,3.76
um,942.0,3.279
and uh,943.36,3.279
and like like i said the the the,945.279,3.12
critical thing to achieve for the,946.639,3.041
revolution in space flight and for,948.399,2.88
humanity to be a space frank,949.68,3.36
civilization is to have a fully and,951.279,5.041
rapidly reusable rocket oval rocket,953.04,5.599
there's not even been any orbital rocket,956.32,3.92
that's been fully reusable ever and this,958.639,3.44
has always been the,960.24,5.76
the the holy grail of rocketry,962.079,4.88
and,966.0,3.6
many smart people very smart people,966.959,4.641
have tried to do this before and have,969.6,4.159
not succeeded so,971.6,5.28
um because it's such a hard problem,973.759,5.281
what's your source of belief,976.88,4.16
in situations like this,979.04,3.68
when the engineering problem is so,981.04,4.479
difficult there's a lot of experts,982.72,5.28
many of whom you admire who have failed,985.519,4.481
in the past yes,988.0,3.44
and,990.0,2.72
um,991.44,3.44
a lot of people,992.72,3.359
you know,994.88,3.12
a lot of experts maybe journalists all,996.079,3.281
the kind of you know the public in,998.0,3.44
general have a lot of doubt about,999.36,4.159
whether it's possible,1001.44,4.56
and you yourself know that even if it's,1003.519,5.041
a non-null set not empty set,1006.0,5.04
of success it's still unlikely or very,1008.56,5.04
difficult like where do you go to both,1011.04,4.0
personally,1013.6,3.84
um intellectually as an engineer as a,1015.04,3.76
team,1017.44,3.519
like for source of strength needed to,1018.8,4.64
sort of persevere through this,1020.959,4.24
and to keep going with the project take,1023.44,4.999
it to completion,1025.199,3.24
a source of strength hmm i i just really,1038.16,4.08
not how i think about things,1040.48,2.959
um,1042.24,2.88
i mean for me it's simply this this is,1043.439,3.441
something that is important to get done,1045.12,2.88
um,1046.88,4.159
and we we should just keep doing it um,1048.0,4.48
or die trying,1051.039,2.401
and i,1052.48,2.319
i don't need,1053.44,3.76
a source of strength so quitting is not,1054.799,4.081
even like um,1057.2,4.64
that's not it's not my nature okay and i,1058.88,4.24
i don't,1061.84,4.32
care about optimism or pessimism,1063.12,4.88
[ __ ] that we're gonna get it done gonna,1066.16,4.32
get it done,1068.0,2.48
can you uh then zoom back in to specific,1071.679,4.721
problems with starship or any,1074.559,3.681
engineering problems you work on,1076.4,3.92
can you try to introspect your,1078.24,3.92
particular biological neural network,1080.32,3.92
your thinking process and describe how,1082.16,3.12
you think,1084.24,2.24
through problems the different,1085.28,2.96
engineering and design problems is there,1086.48,4.0
like a systematic process you've spoken,1088.24,3.84
about first principles thinking but is,1090.48,6.24
there kind of a process to it well um,1092.08,4.64
you know like saying like like physics,1097.12,2.72
is law and everything else is a,1098.64,2.64
recommendation,1099.84,2.8
um like i've met a lot of people who can,1101.28,3.279
break the law but i haven't met anyone,1102.64,4.2
who could break physics,1104.559,7.041
so uh so first for you know any kind of,1106.84,6.839
technology problem you have to sort of,1111.6,4.0
just make sure you're not,1113.679,3.36
violating,1115.6,4.56
physics um,1117.039,3.121
and you know uh,1120.84,4.199
first principles analysis i think is,1123.6,3.439
something that can be applied to,1125.039,4.401
really any walk of life uh any anything,1127.039,3.921
really it's just it's it's really just,1129.44,3.2
saying um,1130.96,3.599
you know let's let's well something down,1132.64,4.0
to the most fundamental,1134.559,3.041
uh,1136.64,2.96
principles the things that we are most,1137.6,3.84
confident are true at a foundational,1139.6,2.72
level,1141.44,2.4
and that sets you at your sets your,1142.32,3.599
axiomatic base and then you reason up,1143.84,4.56
from there and then you cross-check your,1145.919,4.801
conclusion against the the axiomatic,1148.4,4.0
truths,1150.72,2.88
um,1152.4,3.12
so,1153.6,4.079
um you know some basics in physics would,1155.52,3.519
be like are you violating conservation,1157.679,3.041
of energy or momentum or something like,1159.039,3.76
that you know then,1160.72,3.76
it's not gonna work,1162.799,2.88
um,1164.48,3.04
so,1165.679,3.36
uh that's,1167.52,3.36
you know so that's just to establish is,1169.039,3.841
it is it possible,1170.88,3.919
and then another good physics tool is,1172.88,3.679
thinking about things in the limit if,1174.799,3.601
you if you take a particular thing and,1176.559,2.881
you,1178.4,1.84
uh,1179.44,2.4
scale it to a very large number or to a,1180.24,3.84
very small number how does how do things,1181.84,3.36
change,1184.08,3.52
um well it's like tempo like in number,1185.2,4.0
of things you manufacture something like,1187.6,3.92
that and then in time,1189.2,4.24
yeah like let's say say the example of,1191.52,3.44
like um,1193.44,3.28
like manufacturing which i think is just,1194.96,3.36
a very underrated,1196.72,3.6
problem um,1198.32,3.76
and and,1200.32,6.32
uh likes it it's it's much harder to,1202.08,5.599
take,1206.64,3.039
an advanced technology product and bring,1207.679,3.521
it into volume manufacturing than it is,1209.679,3.601
to design it in the first place my,1211.2,4.479
orders magnitude so,1213.28,3.2
um,1215.679,2.081
so let's say you're trying to figure out,1216.48,2.88
is,1217.76,3.039
like why is this,1219.36,2.48
this uh,1220.799,2.321
part or product,1221.84,3.76
expensive is it um,1223.12,3.84
because of something fundamentally,1225.6,2.88
foolish that we're doing or is it,1226.96,4.48
because our volume is too low and so,1228.48,3.92
then you say okay well what if our,1231.44,2.88
volume was a million units a year is it,1232.4,3.68
still expensive that's what i'm,1234.32,2.88
radically thinking about things to the,1236.08,2.88
limit if it's still expensive at a,1237.2,3.52
million units a year then volume is not,1238.96,3.36
the reason why your thing is expensive,1240.72,2.56
there's something fundamental about,1242.32,2.239
design,1243.28,3.04
and then you then can focus on the,1244.559,3.201
reducing complexity or something like,1246.32,3.599
that and change the design to change,1247.76,5.279
changes apart to be something that is uh,1249.919,4.24
uh,1253.039,3.201
not fundamentally expensive,1254.159,4.241
but like that's a common thing in,1256.24,4.4
rocketry because the the unit volume is,1258.4,4.72
relatively low and so a common excuse,1260.64,4.32
would be well it's expensive because our,1263.12,4.08
unit volume is low um and if we were in,1264.96,3.599
like automotive or something like that,1267.2,3.12
or consumer electronics then our costs,1268.559,3.281
would be lower and like i'm like okay so,1270.32,3.359
let's say we skip now you're making a,1271.84,3.12
million units a year is it still,1273.679,3.841
expensive if the answer is yes,1274.96,3.44
then,1277.52,2.159
uh,1278.4,3.519
economies of scale are not the issue,1279.679,3.441
do you throw,1281.919,2.64
into manufacturing do you throw like,1283.12,4.0
supply chain you talk about resources,1284.559,3.921
and materials and stuff like that do you,1287.12,2.799
throw that into the calculation of,1288.48,3.12
trying to reason from first principles,1289.919,2.961
like how we're going to make the supply,1291.6,2.88
chain work here,1292.88,3.919
yeah yeah and then the cost of materials,1294.48,4.319
things like that or is that too much,1296.799,4.641
exactly so um like another like a good,1298.799,4.321
example of thinking about things uh in,1301.44,3.84
the limit is,1303.12,5.76
um if you take any uh,1305.28,5.68
you know any any,1308.88,5.279
product any machine or whatever um,1310.96,4.959
like take a rocket or whatever,1314.159,2.681
and,1315.919,4.321
say uh if you've got if you look at the,1316.84,4.199
room,1320.24,2.48
raw materials in the rocket,1321.039,4.721
um so you're gonna have like uh,1322.72,6.319
aluminum steel titanium inconel,1325.76,6.72
especially specialty alloys um,1329.039,6.561
copper and and you say what are the,1332.48,4.079
how,1335.6,2.24
what what's the weight of the,1336.559,3.281
constituent elements of each of these,1337.84,3.52
elements and what is their raw material,1339.84,2.64
value,1341.36,3.04
and that sets the,1342.48,5.439
asymptotic limit for how,1344.4,4.96
low the cost of the vehicle can be,1347.919,3.76
unless you change the materials,1349.36,3.28
so,1351.679,2.721
and then when you do that i call it like,1352.64,3.36
maybe the magic wand number or something,1354.4,3.44
like that so that would be like if you,1356.0,3.12
had the,1357.84,4.079
you know a like just a pile of these raw,1359.12,4.08
materials here and you could wave magic,1361.919,2.801
wand and rearrange the atoms into the,1363.2,2.8
final shape,1364.72,2.24
um,1366.0,2.24
that would be the,1366.96,3.36
lowest possible cost that you could make,1368.24,3.2
this thing for unless you change the,1370.32,2.239
materials,1371.44,3.2
so then and that is always a you're,1372.559,4.161
almost always a very low number,1374.64,2.96
um,1376.72,3.52
so then the what's actually causing,1377.6,4.319
these to be expensive is how you put the,1380.24,5.52
atoms into the desired shape,1381.919,3.841
yeah actually if you don't mind me,1385.84,4.48
taking a tiny tangent i had uh i often,1387.36,5.12
talked to jim keller who was somebody,1390.32,3.359
that worked with you oh yeah that's a,1392.48,2.8
fantastic job jim was,1393.679,4.0
yeah did great work at tesla,1395.28,3.2
so,1397.679,2.88
um i suppose he carries the flame of the,1398.48,4.96
same kind of thinking that you're you're,1400.559,4.801
talking about now,1403.44,4.64
um and i guess i see that same thing at,1405.36,4.08
tesla,1408.08,3.76
and spacex folks who work there they,1409.44,4.32
kind of learn this way of thinking and,1411.84,4.719
it kind of becomes obvious almost,1413.76,5.2
but anyway i had um argument not,1416.559,3.841
argument,1418.96,3.68
uh he educated me,1420.4,3.279
about,1422.64,2.88
how cheap it might be to manufacture,1423.679,4.401
teslabot we just we had an argument what,1425.52,4.88
is how can you reduce the cost of scale,1428.08,2.959
of,1430.4,2.96
producing a robot because i've gotten a,1431.039,4.801
chance to interact quite a bit um,1433.36,4.48
obviously in in the academic circles,1435.84,4.319
with humanoid robots and then boston,1437.84,4.48
dynamics and stuff like that and they're,1440.159,4.241
very expensive to to build,1442.32,4.64
and then uh jim kind of schooled me on,1444.4,4.8
saying like okay like this kind of first,1446.96,3.76
principle is thinking of how can we get,1449.2,3.839
the cost of manufacturing down,1450.72,5.28
um i suppose you do that you have done,1453.039,4.561
that kind of thinking for teslabot and,1456.0,4.0
for all kinds of,1457.6,4.4
all kinds of complex systems that are,1460.0,3.76
traditionally seen as complex and you,1462.0,3.279
say okay how can we simplify everything,1463.76,3.36
down,1465.279,3.041
yeah,1467.12,3.12
i mean i think if you are really good at,1468.32,3.92
manufacturing,1470.24,3.919
you can basically,1472.24,3.52
make at high volume you can basically,1474.159,4.241
make anything for a cost,1475.76,5.36
that asymptotically approaches the real,1478.4,4.399
raw material value of the constituents,1481.12,3.52
plus any intellectual property that you,1482.799,3.601
need to license,1484.64,4.639
anything right,1486.4,4.48
but it's hard it's not like that's a,1489.279,3.76
very hard thing to do but but it is,1490.88,3.679
possible for anything,1493.039,3.841
anything in volume can be made,1494.559,4.48
like i said for a class,1496.88,3.679
that asymptotically approaches raw,1499.039,3.601
material uh constituents,1500.559,3.521
plus intellectual property license,1502.64,2.639
rights,1504.08,3.44
so what will often happen in trying to,1505.279,4.0
design a product is people will start,1507.52,4.8
with the tools and and parts and methods,1509.279,5.121
that they are familiar with,1512.32,3.2
and then,1514.4,3.519
and try to create a product using their,1515.52,5.519
existing tools and methods,1517.919,5.601
the other way to think about it is,1521.039,4.561
actually imagine the try to imagine the,1523.52,5.36
platonic ideal of the perfect product or,1525.6,5.679
technology whatever it might be,1528.88,4.88
and so what is this what is the perfect,1531.279,4.241
arrangement of atoms,1533.76,3.279
that would be the the best possible,1535.52,2.88
product,1537.039,2.88
and now let us try to figure out how to,1538.4,5.32
get the atoms in that shape,1539.919,3.801
i mean it's it sounds um,1543.76,4.0
it's almost like a rick and morty absurd,1547.84,4.16
until you start to really think about it,1550.32,2.479
and,1552.0,2.72
you really should,1552.799,3.921
think about it in this way because,1554.72,4.16
everything else is kind of uh,1556.72,4.319
if you if you think uh,1558.88,3.52
you you might fall victim to the,1561.039,2.801
momentum of the way things are done in,1562.4,3.44
the past unless you think in this way,1563.84,3.76
well just as a function of inertia,1565.84,3.04
people will,1567.6,2.88
want to use the same tools and methods,1568.88,3.12
that they are familiar with,1570.48,2.64
um,1572.0,2.559
they just that's what they'll do by,1573.12,4.24
default yeah and then that will lead to,1574.559,4.561
an outcome of things that can be made,1577.36,3.6
with those tools and methods but it is,1579.12,3.84
unlikely to be the,1580.96,4.16
platonic idea of the perfect product,1582.96,2.959
um,1585.12,1.76
so,1585.919,3.041
then so that's why it's good to think of,1586.88,3.279
things in both directions they're like,1588.96,2.4
what can we build with the tools that we,1590.159,4.241
have but then but but also what is the,1591.36,4.799
what is the perfect the theoretical,1594.4,3.92
perfect product look like and that that,1596.159,3.601
theoretical perfect part is going to be,1598.32,3.44
a moving target because as you learn,1599.76,2.799
more,1601.76,3.919
the definition of or or for that perfect,1602.559,4.641
product will change because you don't,1605.679,2.801
actually know what the perfect product,1607.2,3.64
is but you can successfully approximate,1608.48,5.679
a more perfect product,1610.84,5.48
so the thing about it like that and then,1614.159,4.561
saying okay now what tools methods,1616.32,5.2
materials whatever do we need to,1618.72,6.12
create in order to get the atoms in that,1621.52,6.32
shape but for people,1624.84,5.079
rarely think about it that way,1627.84,4.64
but it's a powerful tool,1629.919,4.961
i should mention that the brilliant,1632.48,4.559
siobhan zillis is hanging on,1634.88,3.76
hanging out with us,1637.039,3.76
in case you hear a voice of uh wisdom,1638.64,3.2
from uh,1640.799,4.801
from from outside from up above,1641.84,6.319
okay so let me ask you about mars you,1645.6,4.72
mentioned it would be great for science,1648.159,3.601
to put,1650.32,3.52
um a base on the moon to do some,1651.76,3.12
research,1653.84,2.559
but,1654.88,4.0
the truly big leap again in this,1656.399,4.561
category of seemingly impossible is to,1658.88,4.799
put a human being on mars,1660.96,4.48
when do you think spacex will land a,1663.679,5.48
human being on mars,1665.44,3.719
hmm,1670.24,3.0
best case is about five years,1688.64,6.2
worst case tenures,1691.2,3.64
what are the determining factors would,1696.799,4.24
you say from an engineering perspective,1698.559,5.281
or is that that not the bottlenecks,1701.039,5.841
uh you know it's fundamentally um,1703.84,8.0
you know engineering the the vehicle um,1706.88,4.96
i mean starship is the most,1712.24,4.559
complex and advanced rocket that's ever,1715.039,3.76
been made by,1716.799,3.441
i don't know order of magnitude or,1718.799,3.12
something like that it's a lot,1720.24,4.88
it's really next level so,1721.919,4.321
um,1725.12,3.52
and the fundamental optimization of,1726.24,4.48
starship is minimizing cost per ton to,1728.64,4.159
orbit and ultimately cost per ton to the,1730.72,3.679
surface of mars,1732.799,3.041
um this may seem like a mercantile,1734.399,3.041
objective but it is actually the thing,1735.84,4.0
that needs to be optimized,1737.44,4.56
um like there is a certain,1739.84,4.16
cost per tonne to the surface of mars,1742.0,4.08
where we can afford to establish a,1744.0,4.24
self-sustaining uh city,1746.08,3.44
um and,1748.24,2.88
and then above that we cannot afford to,1749.52,4.96
do it um so right right now you couldn't,1751.12,4.96
fly to mars for a trillion dollars,1754.48,3.199
doesn't no amount of money could get,1756.08,3.04
your ticket to mars,1757.679,4.081
so we need to get that above,1759.12,4.4
uh you know to get that like something,1761.76,5.039
that is actually possible at all um,1763.52,4.08
um,1766.799,3.12
but but then but that's that's,1767.6,4.319
we don't just want to have,1769.919,3.841
you know with mars flags and footprints,1771.919,3.281
and then not come back for a half,1773.76,3.6
century like we did with the moon,1775.2,2.88
uh,1777.36,4.0
in order to pass,1778.08,5.92
a very important great filter i think we,1781.36,4.72
need to be a multi-planet species,1784.0,4.159
um,1786.08,4.56
this may sound somewhat esoteric to,1788.159,4.0
to a lot of people but,1790.64,2.8
uh,1792.159,4.0
like eventually given enough time,1793.44,3.68
uh,1796.159,2.321
that's something,1797.12,3.279
the earth is likely to experience,1798.48,5.439
some calamity um that could be,1800.399,4.321
uh,1803.919,2.721
something that humans do to themselves,1804.72,3.76
or an external event like happen to the,1806.64,3.12
dinosaurs,1808.48,2.559
um,1809.76,2.24
and,1811.039,4.081
um but a bit of you know eventually,1812.0,5.84
and if nothing if none of that happens,1815.12,6.0
and somehow magically we keep going,1817.84,5.439
then the sun will the sun is gradually,1821.12,3.36
expanding,1823.279,4.161
um and will engulf the earth um and,1824.48,5.76
probably earth gets too hot for,1827.44,4.719
uh life in,1830.24,3.2
uh,1832.159,3.12
about 500 million years it's a long time,1833.44,2.959
but that's only,1835.279,3.921
10 longer than earth has been around,1836.399,5.681
and so if you think about like the,1839.2,4.24
because the current situation is really,1842.08,3.12
remarkable um and kind of hard to,1843.44,4.0
believe but,1845.2,2.959
uh,1847.44,2.08
it's been around four and a half billion,1848.159,3.361
years and this is the first time if one,1849.52,3.12
half billion years that has been,1851.52,4.08
possible to extend life beyond earth,1852.64,5.36
and that window opportunity may be open,1855.6,4.16
for a long time and i hope it is but it,1858.0,3.84
also may be open for a short time and we,1859.76,4.639
should uh i think it was,1861.84,4.559
wise for us to,1864.399,4.0
uh,1866.399,4.481
act quickly while the window is open,1868.399,5.201
just in case it closes,1870.88,5.039
yeah the existence of nuclear weapons,1873.6,4.079
pandemics,1875.919,3.841
all kinds of threats yeah,1877.679,4.801
should uh should kind of um,1879.76,5.2
give us some motivation,1882.48,4.72
i mean civilization could get,1884.96,3.76
um,1887.2,3.68
could die with a bang or a whimper,1888.72,4.079
you know if it's uh,1890.88,4.159
if it dies a demographic collapse then,1892.799,3.76
it's more of a whimper,1895.039,2.88
obviously,1896.559,2.881
but if it's world war three it's more of,1897.919,2.64
a bang,1899.44,3.04
but but these are all risks,1900.559,3.521
um i mean it's important to think of,1902.48,2.799
these things and just,1904.08,2.16
you know think of things as like,1905.279,3.28
probabilities not certainties um there's,1906.24,4.559
a certain probability that,1908.559,4.561
something bad will happen on earth like,1910.799,4.161
i think most likely the future will be,1913.12,3.2
good um,1914.96,2.559
but there's like let's say for,1916.32,4.0
argument's sake um a one percent chance,1917.519,4.481
per century of,1920.32,3.44
of a civilization ending event like that,1922.0,4.32
was stephen hawking's estimate,1923.76,3.759
um,1926.32,2.8
i think he's he might be right about,1927.519,2.481
that,1929.12,2.76
uh so,1930.0,5.2
then uh,1931.88,5.48
you know we should basically,1935.2,3.68
think of this like being a multi-planet,1937.36,3.12
species just like taking out insurance,1938.88,3.76
for life itself like life insurance for,1940.48,2.58
life,1942.64,4.08
[Laughter],1943.06,5.739
so it's turned into an infomercial real,1946.72,4.24
quick life insurance for life yes,1948.799,5.201
um and you know we we can bring the the,1950.96,5.28
the creatures from uh you know plants,1954.0,4.0
and animals from earth to mars and,1956.24,4.799
breathe life into the planet um,1958.0,5.039
and and have a second planet with with,1961.039,3.36
life um,1963.039,3.36
that would be great um they can't bring,1964.399,4.0
themselves there you know so if we don't,1966.399,3.361
bring them to mars,1968.399,2.801
then they will just,1969.76,3.84
for sure all die when the sun expands,1971.2,5.04
anyway and then that'll be it what do,1973.6,4.799
you think is the most difficult aspect,1976.24,4.559
of building a civilization on mars,1978.399,4.64
terraforming mars like from engineering,1980.799,4.801
perspective from a financial perspective,1983.039,6.961
human perspective to get,1985.6,7.28
get a large number of folks there,1990.0,5.44
who will never return back to earth,1992.88,4.24
uh no they could certainly return some,1995.44,3.28
will return back to earth they will,1997.12,3.2
choose to stay there for the rest of,1998.72,4.88
their lives yeah many will um,2000.32,6.8
but uh we you know we,2003.6,4.959
we need the spaceships back like the,2007.12,3.2
ones that go to mars read them back so,2008.559,3.6
you can hop on if you want you know it's,2010.32,3.52
like but we can't just not have the,2012.159,3.12
spaceships come back those things are,2013.84,3.52
expensive we need them i'd like to come,2015.279,3.681
back and do another trip i mean do you,2017.36,3.439
think about the terraforming aspect like,2018.96,3.36
actually building are you so focused,2020.799,3.841
right now on the spaceships part that's,2022.32,4.479
so critical yeah tomorrow,2024.64,3.44
we absolutely if you can't get there,2026.799,2.72
nothing else matters,2028.08,2.4
so,2029.519,2.0
and like i said,2030.48,2.48
we can't get there with,2031.519,3.201
at some extraordinarily high cost i mean,2032.96,3.12
the current cost of,2034.72,3.12
um let's say,2036.08,4.319
one ton to the surface of mars is on the,2037.84,4.8
order of a billion dollars,2040.399,3.201
so,2042.64,2.0
because you don't just need the rocket,2043.6,2.079
and the launch and everything you need,2044.64,3.999
like heat shield you need you know,2045.679,5.2
guidance system you need deep space,2048.639,4.561
communications you need some kind of,2050.879,4.081
landing system,2053.2,5.439
so like rough approximation would be,2054.96,5.52
a billion dollars per ton to the surface,2058.639,3.121
of mars right now,2060.48,3.28
um this is obviously,2061.76,4.159
um,2063.76,3.76
way too expensive to create a,2065.919,3.601
self-sustaining civilization,2067.52,3.04
um,2069.52,4.559
so we need to improve that by,2070.56,6.16
at least a factor of a thousand,2074.079,4.241
a million per ton,2076.72,3.52
yes ideally less than much less than a,2078.32,4.079
million ton but if it's not,2080.24,3.839
like it's got to be,2082.399,4.401
say if i say like what well how much can,2084.079,4.56
society affords to spend or want to just,2086.8,4.16
want to spend on a self-sustaining,2088.639,4.561
city on mars the self-sustaining part is,2090.96,4.48
important like it's just the key,2093.2,3.76
threshold,2095.44,3.679
um the grateful to,2096.96,4.32
will will have been passed,2099.119,5.041
when the city on mars,2101.28,5.04
it can survive even if the spaceships,2104.16,4.72
from earth stop coming for any reason,2106.32,3.759
doesn't matter what the reason is but if,2108.88,3.44
they stop coming for any reason will it,2110.079,4.321
die out will it not and if there's even,2112.32,4.799
one critical ingredient missing then,2114.4,4.719
it still doesn't count it's like,2117.119,3.201
you know if you're on a long sea voyage,2119.119,2.561
and you've got everything except vitamin,2120.32,3.36
c,2121.68,3.2
and it's only a matter of time you know,2123.68,2.48
you're going to die,2124.88,4.0
so so we're going to get mars city to,2126.16,5.199
the point where it's self-sustaining,2128.88,4.239
um i'm not sure this will really happen,2131.359,3.681
in my lifetime but i i hope to see it at,2133.119,4.081
least have a lot of momentum,2135.04,3.6
and and then you could say okay what is,2137.2,4.24
the minimum tonnage necessary to,2138.64,6.32
have a self-sustaining city um,2141.44,4.639
and there's a lot of uncertainty about,2144.96,3.44
this you could say like i don't know,2146.079,4.721
it's probably at least a million tons,2148.4,3.439
um,2150.8,2.16
because you have to set up a lot of,2151.839,3.361
infrastructure on on mars,2152.96,4.96
like i said you can't be missing any,2155.2,4.639
anything that,2157.92,3.199
in order to be self-sustaining you can't,2159.839,2.641
be missed like you need you know,2161.119,2.801
semiconductor,2162.48,3.28
fabs you need,2163.92,4.24
iron ore refineries like you need lots,2165.76,5.04
of things you know so,2168.16,5.36
um and mars is not super hospitable it's,2170.8,4.96
it's the least inhospitable planet but,2173.52,3.68
it's definitely a fixer-upper of a,2175.76,3.599
planet outside of earth,2177.2,3.84
yeah the earth is pretty earth is like,2179.359,2.641
easy,2181.04,3.28
yeah and also we should clarify in the,2182.0,4.56
solar system yes in the solar system,2184.32,3.6
there might be nice,2186.56,3.6
like vacation spots there might be some,2187.92,4.32
great planets out there but,2190.16,4.56
it's hard to get there yeah way way way,2192.24,4.24
way too hard,2194.72,3.92
to say at least let me push back on that,2196.48,3.84
not really a pushback but a quick,2198.64,3.68
curveball of a question so you did,2200.32,3.759
mention physics as the the first,2202.32,3.44
starting point so,2204.079,3.841
um,2205.76,5.28
general relativity allows for wormholes,2207.92,5.28
uh they technically can exist do you,2211.04,4.72
think um those can ever be leveraged by,2213.2,3.919
humans to travel faster than the speed,2215.76,3.599
of light,2217.119,4.161
well,2219.359,3.361
are you saying the whole thing is,2221.28,4.64
debatable uh the,2222.72,3.2
that we currently do not know of any,2226.0,3.28
means of going faster than the speed of,2227.599,2.561
light,2229.28,2.799
uh,2230.16,4.64
there is like,2232.079,4.961
like,2234.8,2.24
there are some ideas about,2237.599,6.24
having space like so so,2240.079,3.76
you can only move at the speed of light,2245.04,3.52
through through space but,2246.4,5.04
if you can make space itself move,2248.56,4.88
that that's like that that's,2251.44,3.84
warping space,2253.44,4.48
um space is is capable of moving faster,2255.28,4.16
than the speed of light,2257.92,2.4
right,2259.44,2.56
uh like the universe in the big bang the,2260.32,3.759
universe the universe expanded at much,2262.0,3.839
much more than the speed of light,2264.079,4.76
by a lot yeah um,2265.839,5.841
so um,2268.839,5.561
but the,2271.68,2.72
if this is possible the the amount of,2275.119,5.281
energy required towards space is so,2276.96,6.0
gigantic it's boggles the mind,2280.4,3.92
so all the work you've done with,2282.96,2.96
propulsion how much innovation is,2284.32,4.16
possible with rocket propulsion is this,2285.92,3.6
um,2288.48,2.96
i mean you've seen it all and you're,2289.52,4.8
constantly innovating in every aspect,2291.44,4.56
how much is possible like how much can,2294.32,3.68
you get 10x somehow is there something,2296.0,3.52
in there in physics,2298.0,3.04
that you can get significant improvement,2299.52,3.04
in terms of efficiency of engines and,2301.04,3.44
all those kinds of things,2302.56,3.76
well as i'm saying like the,2304.48,4.96
really the holy grail is a fully and,2306.32,6.64
rapidly reusable orbital system um,2309.44,4.639
so,2312.96,3.36
uh right now uh,2314.079,3.201
the,2316.32,4.08
falcon 9 is the only reusable rocket out,2317.28,5.12
there that but it but,2320.4,4.08
the the booster comes back and lands and,2322.4,4.0
you've seen the videos and we get the,2324.48,3.52
nose cone or faring back but we do not,2326.4,3.28
get the upper stage back,2328.0,3.44
so,2329.68,2.8
uh,2331.44,2.72
that means that we have a minimum cost,2332.48,2.879
of,2334.16,3.36
building up for stage um,2335.359,3.841
you can think of like a two-stage rocket,2337.52,3.44
of sort of like two airplanes like a big,2339.2,3.84
airplane and a smaller airplane,2340.96,3.76
um and we get big airplane back but not,2343.04,3.68
the smaller airplane and so it still,2344.72,4.56
costs a lot you know so that upper stage,2346.72,3.44
is,2349.28,2.96
you know at least 10 million dollars,2350.16,3.04
um,2352.24,2.4
and then the,2353.2,3.44
degree of the the booster is not as,2354.64,3.52
reused it's not as rapidly and,2356.64,2.959
completely reusable as we'd like in,2358.16,3.6
order of the fairings so,2359.599,3.76
you know our kind of,2361.76,3.76
minimum marginal cost not counting,2363.359,4.641
overhead for per flight is on the order,2365.52,3.92
of,2368.0,2.88
15,2369.44,3.44
to 20 million dollars maybe,2370.88,4.32
um so,2372.88,4.959
uh that's that's extremely good for,2375.2,4.159
it's by far better than any rocket ever,2377.839,3.681
in history um,2379.359,3.281
but,2381.52,1.92
uh,2382.64,4.0
with full and rapid reusability we can,2383.44,6.56
reduce the cost per ton to orbit by,2386.64,6.24
uh a factor of a hundred,2390.0,5.119
but just think of it like um,2392.88,3.76
like imagine if you had an aircraft or,2395.119,4.081
something or a car,2396.64,5.12
oh yeah and if you had to,2399.2,4.8
buy a new car every time you went for a,2401.76,4.8
drive it would be very expensive,2404.0,4.16
it'll be silly frankly,2406.56,2.279
but,2408.16,3.199
um but you in fact you just refuel the,2408.839,4.52
car or recharge the car,2411.359,5.76
and that's uh makes your trip,2413.359,4.96
like,2417.119,3.121
i don't know a thousand times cheaper,2418.319,3.441
so,2420.24,4.32
it's the same for rockets uh if you,2421.76,3.76
it's,2424.56,2.24
very difficult to make this complex,2425.52,3.04
machine that can go to orbit,2426.8,4.08
and so if you cannot reuse it and if you,2428.56,4.32
have to throw even any part of any,2430.88,3.6
significant part of it away that,2432.88,3.959
massively increases the cost,2434.48,4.32
so,2436.839,4.841
you know starship in theory could do,2438.8,5.44
a cost per launch of like a million,2441.68,3.919
maybe two million dollars or something,2444.24,2.48
like that,2445.599,2.641
um,2446.72,2.96
and uh,2448.24,4.16
and put over 100 tons in orbit,2449.68,4.72
which is crazy yeah,2452.4,3.919
so that's incredible so you're saying,2454.4,3.84
like it's uh by far the biggest bang for,2456.319,4.241
the buck is to make it fully reusable,2458.24,4.64
versus like some kind of,2460.56,4.16
brilliant breakthrough in theoretical,2462.88,2.8
physics,2464.72,2.639
no no there's no there's no brilliant,2465.68,3.36
break no there's no,2467.359,3.121
it just me you're gonna make the rocket,2469.04,3.12
reusable this is an extremely difficult,2470.48,2.879
insuring problem,2472.16,2.959
got it uh but no no new physics is,2473.359,4.081
required,2475.119,2.321
just brilliant engineering let me ask a,2477.839,4.24
slightly philosophical fun question,2479.92,3.919
gotta ask i know you're focused on,2482.079,4.081
getting to mars but once we're there on,2483.839,4.721
mars what do you what form of government,2486.16,4.56
economic system,2488.56,4.48
political system do you think would work,2490.72,6.32
best for an early civilization of humans,2493.04,5.84
is the i mean,2497.04,3.84
the the interesting reason to talk about,2498.88,4.0
this stuff it also make helps people,2500.88,3.84
dream about the future i know you're,2502.88,3.439
really focused about,2504.72,3.359
the short-term engineering dream but,2506.319,3.361
it's like i don't know there's something,2508.079,3.601
about imagining an actual civilization,2509.68,4.0
on mars that gives people,2511.68,4.0
it really gives people hope well it,2513.68,3.439
would be a new frontier and an,2515.68,3.04
opportunity to rethink the whole nature,2517.119,3.681
of government just as was done in the,2518.72,3.92
creation of the united states,2520.8,4.0
so,2522.64,2.16
i mean i would suggest,2527.28,2.88
having a,2531.119,4.081
direct democracy like people vote,2532.96,3.68
directly on things as opposed to,2535.2,4.399
representative democracy so,2536.64,5.36
uh representative democracy i think is,2539.599,3.201
too,2542.0,4.64
uh subject to a special interest and,2542.8,5.76
you know a coercion of the politicians,2546.64,4.56
and that kind of thing um,2548.56,4.48
so i i'd recommend,2551.2,4.0
uh,2553.04,4.72
that that there's just,2555.2,5.2
um direct democracy people vote on laws,2557.76,4.8
the population votes on laws themselves,2560.4,3.919
and then the laws must be short enough,2562.56,4.24
that people can understand them,2564.319,4.241
yeah and then like keeping a,2566.8,3.68
well-informed populist like really being,2568.56,3.519
transparent about all the information,2570.48,3.2
about what they're voting for absolute,2572.079,4.081
transparency yeah and not make it as,2573.68,4.24
annoying as those cookies we have to,2576.16,2.88
accept,2577.92,3.439
cookies like always like,2579.04,3.279
you know there's like always like a,2581.359,2.881
slight amount of trepidation when you,2582.319,4.0
click accept cookies like i feel as,2584.24,3.52
though there's like perhaps like a like,2586.319,3.52
a very tiny chance that'll open a portal,2587.76,4.559
to hell or something like that that's,2589.839,5.441
exactly how i feel why why do they why,2592.319,4.321
do they keep wanting to accept that what,2595.28,3.6
do they want with this cookie,2596.64,3.84
like somebody got upset with accepting,2598.88,3.439
cookies or something somewhere,2600.48,3.44
who cares like,2602.319,3.601
so annoying to keep accepting all these,2603.92,4.399
cookies to me this is just,2605.92,4.24
a great exception yes you can have my,2608.319,3.76
damn cookie i don't care whatever,2610.16,4.24
you heard it from me on first he accepts,2612.079,5.681
all your damn cookies yeah,2614.4,5.679
and start asking me,2617.76,3.52
annoying,2620.079,2.561
yeah it's uh it's,2621.28,3.839
one example of um,2622.64,6.4
implementation of a good idea done,2625.119,6.0
really horribly yeah it's somebody was,2629.04,3.799
like there's some good intentions of,2631.119,4.161
like privacy or whatever but now,2632.839,3.961
everyone's just has to take accept,2635.28,3.28
cookies and it's not you know you have,2636.8,2.88
billions of people who have to keep,2638.56,2.4
clicking except cookie it's super,2639.68,2.56
annoying,2640.96,3.119
then we just accept the damn cookie it's,2642.24,2.8
fine,2644.079,2.721
there is like um,2645.04,3.52
i think a fundamental problem that we're,2646.8,3.44
because we've not really had a,2648.56,3.36
a major,2650.24,3.119
uh like a world war or something like,2651.92,3.199
that in a while and obviously we would,2653.359,4.401
like to not have world wars um,2655.119,4.24
the there's not been a cleansing,2657.76,4.8
function for rules and regulations um,2659.359,5.921
so wars did have uh you know some sort,2662.56,5.279
of lining in that there would be a a,2665.28,4.96
reset on rules and regulations uh after,2667.839,4.161
a war um so world wars one and two there,2670.24,3.359
were huge resets on rules and,2672.0,3.599
regulations,2673.599,2.961
now as,2675.599,2.641
for if the society society does not have,2676.56,2.72
a war,2678.24,2.64
and there's no cleansing function or,2679.28,2.799
garbage collection for rules and,2680.88,2.8
regulations then rules and regulations,2682.079,3.04
will accumulate every year because,2683.68,4.159
they're immortal there's no actual,2685.119,6.401
humans die but the laws don't so,2687.839,5.201
we need a garbage collection function,2691.52,3.2
for rules and regulations they should,2693.04,2.72
not just,2694.72,3.599
be immortal um because some of the rules,2695.76,4.16
and regulations that are put in place,2698.319,3.76
will be counterproductive uh done with,2699.92,3.679
good intentions but counterproductive,2702.079,3.441
sometimes not done with good intentions,2703.599,3.361
so,2705.52,3.2
um if you just if rules and regulations,2706.96,3.68
just accumulate every year,2708.72,3.76
and you get more and more of them then,2710.64,3.36
eventually you won't be able to do,2712.48,3.839
anything you're just like gulliver with,2714.0,4.16
you know tied down by thousands of,2716.319,3.121
little strings,2718.16,3.439
and we had we see that in,2719.44,4.8
um you know,2721.599,4.161
us and,2724.24,4.32
like basically all economies that uh,2725.76,4.8
have been around for for a while,2728.56,5.759
uh and and regulators and legislators,2730.56,5.36
create new rules and regulations every,2734.319,3.441
year but they don't put effort into,2735.92,3.36
removing them and i think that's very,2737.76,2.559
important that we put effort into,2739.28,3.039
removing rules and regulations,2740.319,3.441
um,2742.319,2.481
but it gets tough because you get,2743.76,2.72
special interests that then are,2744.8,3.68
dependent on like they they have a,2746.48,3.28
you know a uh,2748.48,2.639
vested interest in that whatever rule,2749.76,3.12
and regulation and that they then they,2751.119,2.72
fight,2752.88,3.28
to not get it removed,2753.839,3.601
um,2756.16,3.04
yeah so it i mean i guess the problem,2757.44,4.159
with the constitution is it's it's kind,2759.2,3.84
of like c,2761.599,3.601
versus java because it doesn't have any,2763.04,3.76
garbage collection built in i think,2765.2,3.36
there should be i when you first said,2766.8,3.44
the the the metaphor of garbage,2768.56,3.759
collection from a coding standpoint from,2770.24,4.079
the colony standpoint yeah yeah i it,2772.319,3.601
would be interesting interesting if the,2774.319,4.241
laws themselves kind of had a built-in,2775.92,4.32
thing where they kind of die after a,2778.56,3.44
while unless somebody explicitly,2780.24,3.599
publicly defends them yeah so that,2782.0,3.44
that's sort of it's not like somebody,2783.839,3.0
has to kill them they kind of die,2785.44,4.48
themselves they disappear yeah,2786.839,5.401
um,2789.92,2.32
not to defend java or anything but you,2792.4,4.4
know the c plus plus you know you could,2794.16,4.32
also have a great garbage collection in,2796.8,3.039
python and so on,2798.48,3.76
yeah so yeah something's good something,2799.839,3.76
needs to happen,2802.24,3.599
or or just the the civilization's,2803.599,4.881
arteries arteries just harden over time,2805.839,4.641
and and you can just get less and less,2808.48,3.92
done because there's just a rule against,2810.48,4.32
everything,2812.4,2.4
so yeah i think like i don't know for,2814.839,4.361
mars order i'd say or even for you,2817.2,3.36
obviously for earth as well like i think,2819.2,3.44
there should be an active process for,2820.56,3.36
removing,2822.64,2.719
rules and regulations and questioning,2823.92,3.04
their existence,2825.359,3.281
just um,2826.96,3.359
like if we've got a function for,2828.64,2.88
creating rules and regulations because,2830.319,2.641
rules and regulations can also think of,2831.52,3.68
as like they're like software or lines,2832.96,4.08
of code for operating,2835.2,4.08
uh civilization that's the rules and,2837.04,4.0
regulations um,2839.28,3.12
so it's like we shouldn't have rules and,2841.04,2.88
regulations but you have code,2842.4,4.56
accumulation but no code removal,2843.92,4.8
um and so it just gets,2846.96,4.399
to become basically archaic bloatware,2848.72,4.16
after a while,2851.359,4.161
um and and it's just it makes it hard,2852.88,3.52
for,2855.52,2.24
things to progress,2856.4,2.24
so,2857.76,2.4
i don't know maybe mars you'd have like,2858.64,2.959
an uh,2860.16,2.72
you know any given law must have a,2861.599,4.401
sunset you know and and and uh and,2862.88,4.88
require active,2866.0,3.599
voting to keep,2867.76,3.76
restoring to keep it up there you know,2869.599,4.321
um and i actually also say like,2871.52,3.52
and these just i don't know,2873.92,4.399
recommendations or thoughts and,2875.04,4.64
ultimately we'll be up to the people on,2878.319,3.601
mars to decide but,2879.68,4.399
i think um,2881.92,4.8
it should be easier to remove a law than,2884.079,4.721
to add one because of the just to,2886.72,3.92
overcome the inertia of laws,2888.8,2.799
so,2890.64,3.6
maybe it's like uh,2891.599,4.801
for argument's sake you need like say 60,2894.24,5.359
percent vote to have a law take effect,2896.4,6.8
but only a 40 vote to remove it,2899.599,6.161
so let me be the guy you posted meme on,2903.2,4.399
twitter recently where there's,2905.76,4.799
there's like a row of urinals a guy just,2907.599,5.361
walks all the way across,2910.559,5.201
and he tells you about crypto,2912.96,4.56
listen i mean that's happened to me,2915.76,3.28
so many times i think maybe even,2917.52,4.16
literally uh yeah,2919.04,4.319
do you think technologically speaking,2921.68,3.919
there's any room for ideas of smart,2923.359,4.48
contracts or so on because you mentioned,2925.599,3.201
laws,2927.839,2.961
um that's an interesting implement use,2928.8,4.319
of things like smart contracts to,2930.8,4.48
implement the laws by which governments,2933.119,4.161
function,2935.28,3.76
like something built on ethereum or,2937.28,3.68
maybe,2939.04,4.72
a dog coin that enables smart contracts,2940.96,5.119
somehow i never i don't quite understand,2943.76,4.48
this whole smart contract thing um you,2946.079,3.921
know,2948.24,3.92
i mean,2950.0,3.599
so it's two dumb times to have small,2952.16,2.64
contracts,2953.599,4.24
it's a good line,2954.8,5.039
i mean my general approach to any kind,2957.839,4.081
of like deal or whatever is just make,2959.839,3.76
sure there's clarity of understanding,2961.92,3.439
that's the most important thing,2963.599,4.561
um and and just keep any kind of deal,2965.359,4.48
very very short and simple plain,2968.16,3.12
language,2969.839,3.441
and just make sure everyone understands,2971.28,4.0
this is the deal does everyone is it,2973.28,3.2
clear,2975.28,3.2
and uh,2976.48,3.599
and and what are the consequences if,2978.48,4.0
various things don't happen um,2980.079,5.76
but usually deals are um,2982.48,5.44
you know business deals or whatever are,2985.839,4.081
way too long and complex and overly,2987.92,4.72
lawyered and pointlessly,2989.92,5.28
you mentioned that uh doge is the,2992.64,4.24
people's coin,2995.2,3.28
yeah and you said that you were,2996.88,3.84
literally going spacex,2998.48,3.04
may,3000.72,2.96
consider literally putting,3001.52,4.72
uh a dosh coin on,3003.68,3.679
the moon,3006.24,2.48
is this something you're still,3007.359,4.48
considering uh mars perhaps,3008.72,4.96
do you think there's some chance we've,3011.839,4.081
talked about political systems on mars,3013.68,4.879
that uh dogecoin is the,3015.92,4.639
official currency of mars that's coming,3018.559,3.921
in the future,3020.559,2.641
well,3022.48,3.359
i think mars itself will need to have a,3023.2,4.8
different currency because you can't,3025.839,5.201
synchronize due to speed of light,3028.0,5.119
or not easily um so it must be,3031.04,5.36
completely standalone from earth,3033.119,5.2
well yeah because the,3036.4,2.8
but,3038.319,3.28
mars is at closest approach it's four,3039.2,4.399
light minutes away roughly and then at,3041.599,4.24
furthest approach uh it's roughly 20,3043.599,3.601
light minutes away,3045.839,4.081
uh maybe a little more um,3047.2,4.24
so you can't really have something,3049.92,3.76
synchronizing you know if you could if,3051.44,3.679
if you've got a 20 minute speed light,3053.68,3.04
issue if it's got a one minute,3055.119,3.361
blockchain uh it's not going to,3056.72,3.2
synchronize properly,3058.48,2.56
um,3059.92,3.439
so mars really would i don't know if,3061.04,3.68
mars would have a cryptocurrency as a,3063.359,4.081
thing but probably seems likely,3064.72,4.399
but it would be some kind of localized,3067.44,4.399
thing on mars,3069.119,2.72
and you let the people decide,3072.16,3.52
yeah,3074.72,3.2
absolutely,3075.68,3.439
the future of mars should be up to the,3077.92,2.72
martians,3079.119,4.801
yeah so um,3080.64,5.12
i mean i think the cryptocurrency thing,3083.92,4.0
is an interesting,3085.76,4.24
approach to,3087.92,5.6
reducing the um,3090.0,5.599
error in the,3093.52,5.2
the database that is called money,3095.599,5.361
um,3098.72,2.24
you know i think i have a pretty deep,3101.04,3.2
understanding of the of what money,3102.319,3.841
actually is on a practical day-to-day,3104.24,4.599
basis because of paypal,3106.16,5.6
um you know i really,3108.839,6.201
got in deep there um,3111.76,4.24
and,3115.04,3.279
right now the money system actually for,3116.0,3.839
practical purposes is,3118.319,4.961
is really a bunch of uh heterogeneous uh,3119.839,7.52
mainframes running uh old cobalt,3123.28,6.16
okay you mean literally that's literally,3127.359,3.521
that is literally what's happening in,3129.44,3.2
batch mode,3130.88,4.479
okay in patch mode yeah uh pretty the,3132.64,4.719
poor fastest who have to,3135.359,4.801
maintain that code okay that's a,3137.359,5.521
that's a pain that's pain not even for,3140.16,5.76
trans cobalt yep it's cobalt it's like,3142.88,4.479
and they still,3145.92,2.88
banks are still buying mainframes in,3147.359,5.121
2021 and running ancient global code,3148.8,5.6
uh and uh,3152.48,4.0
you know the the federal reserve is like,3154.4,3.919
probably even older than the what the,3156.48,3.599
banks have and they have an old kobold,3158.319,3.52
mainframe,3160.079,5.121
and so now and and so the the government,3161.839,5.28
effectively has editing privileges on,3165.2,4.159
the on the money database,3167.119,4.321
um and they use those editing privileges,3169.359,3.921
to um,3171.44,3.28
make more money,3173.28,3.039
whenever they want,3174.72,3.599
and this increases the error in the,3176.319,4.721
database that is money so i think money,3178.319,4.081
should really be viewed through the lens,3181.04,3.44
of information theory,3182.4,4.64
and uh and so it's uh,3184.48,4.16
you're kind of like uh like an internet,3187.04,4.319
connection like what's the bandwidth uh,3188.64,3.84
you know,3191.359,3.441
total bit rate uh what is the latency,3192.48,3.28
judder,3194.8,3.68
uh packet drop uh you know,3195.76,4.96
errors in errors in the network uh,3198.48,4.16
communication,3200.72,3.92
using money like that basically,3202.64,3.76
um i think that's probably why i really,3204.64,2.8
think of it,3206.4,3.6
and and then say what what system,3207.44,3.6
uh,3210.0,2.8
from an information theory standpoint,3211.04,4.319
allows an economy to function the best,3212.8,3.68
uh,3215.359,2.801
and,3216.48,3.28
you know um,3218.16,4.56
crypto is an attempt to reduce the,3219.76,4.24
the error,3222.72,3.52
uh in,3224.0,5.44
uh in money that is contributed by,3226.24,5.28
uh governments uh,3229.44,3.919
diluting the money supply,3231.52,4.48
as basically a pernicious pernicious,3233.359,5.361
form of taxation,3236.0,5.04
so both policy in terms of with,3238.72,6.0
inflation and actual like technological,3241.04,6.559
cobalt like cryptocurrency takes us into,3244.72,5.359
the 21st century in terms of the actual,3247.599,3.841
systems that allow you to do the,3250.079,2.801
transaction to store wealth all those,3251.44,3.919
kinds of things,3252.88,2.479
like i said just think of money as,3256.72,3.599
information people um often will think,3257.92,4.08
of money as having power in and of,3260.319,5.681
itself um it does not money is uh is,3262.0,6.559
information and it it does not have,3266.0,4.24
power in and of itself,3268.559,2.481
uh,3270.24,3.119
the like the you know again applying the,3271.04,3.44
physics,3273.359,2.48
tools of thinking about things in the,3274.48,2.24
limit,3275.839,3.201
is helpful if you are stranded on a,3276.72,3.76
tropical island,3279.04,4.0
um and uh,3280.48,6.8
you have a trillion dollars it's useless,3283.04,4.24
because there's no there's no resource,3287.52,2.88
allocation,3289.359,2.161
money is a database for resource,3290.4,2.0
allocation,3291.52,2.079
but there's no resources to allocate,3292.4,2.48
except yourself,3293.599,3.041
so money is useless,3294.88,4.08
um,3296.64,2.32
uh,3299.04,3.039
if you're surrounded on desert island,3300.799,2.401
with,3302.079,4.24
no food you'd uh all the bitcoin in the,3303.2,4.56
world,3306.319,3.361
will,3307.76,4.559
not stop you from starving yeah,3309.68,3.919
so,3312.319,3.52
um,3313.599,6.641
so like just think of money as as a,3315.839,6.641
database for resource allocation um,3320.24,4.64
across time and space,3322.48,3.359
and,3324.88,4.479
um and then what what what system,3325.839,6.161
uh it is what what,3329.359,5.121
in what form should that that,3332.0,4.799
database or data system,3334.48,4.4
what what what would be most effective,3336.799,2.881
now,3338.88,2.4
there's a there is a fundamental issue,3339.68,5.919
with um say bitcoin in its current form,3341.28,6.559
uh in that it's the transaction volume,3345.599,3.76
is very limited,3347.839,2.801
um,3349.359,3.44
and uh the,3350.64,5.679
latency this is the latency for for a,3352.799,5.201
properly confirmed transaction is to is,3356.319,3.76
too long much longer than you'd like,3358.0,4.72
so it's not it's actually not great from,3360.079,3.441
um,3362.72,2.639
a transaction volume standpoint or a,3363.52,3.52
latency standpoint,3365.359,3.361
um,3367.04,4.96
uh so it is perhaps useful as,3368.72,5.839
as to search to solve an aspect of the,3372.0,5.76
money database problem uh,3374.559,5.441
which is the sort of store of wealth or,3377.76,2.88
an,3380.0,2.16
accounting of,3380.64,4.8
relative obligations i suppose,3382.16,6.32
but it is not useful as a,3385.44,5.359
currency as a day-to-day currency but,3388.48,3.599
people have proposed different,3390.799,3.361
technological solutions,3392.079,3.921
yeah lightning network and the layer two,3394.16,4.0
technologies on top of that i mean it's,3396.0,4.079
it's all it seems to be all kind of a,3398.16,4.159
trade-off but the point is it's kind of,3400.079,3.76
brilliant to say that just think about,3402.319,3.28
information think about what kind of,3403.839,3.201
database what kind of infrastructure,3405.599,3.681
enables yeah like you're operating an,3407.04,3.279
economy,3409.28,2.0
um,3410.319,2.8
and you need to have some,3411.28,3.44
thing that,3413.119,3.921
allows for the efficient,3414.72,3.76
to have efficient,3417.04,3.36
uh value ratios between products and,3418.48,4.0
services so you've got this massive,3420.4,3.6
number of products and services and you,3422.48,2.879
need to,3424.0,3.76
you can't just bar barter it's like that,3425.359,4.161
would be extremely unwieldy,3427.76,4.72
so you need something that gives you the,3429.52,4.0
the,3432.48,1.92
an,3433.52,2.079
a,3434.4,1.919
a,3435.599,2.801
ratio of exchange between goods and,3436.319,3.28
services,3438.4,2.08
um,3439.599,2.96
and and then something that allows you,3440.48,2.8
to,3442.559,3.441
uh shift obligations across time like,3443.28,4.799
debt debt and equity shift obligations,3446.0,4.319
across time then what does what does the,3448.079,3.681
best job of that,3450.319,2.8
um,3451.76,3.52
part reason why i think there's some,3453.119,4.881
um merit to dogecoin even though it was,3455.28,5.839
obviously created as a joke um,3458.0,4.48
is that,3461.119,4.24
it it actually does have a much higher,3462.48,5.04
uh transaction volume capability than,3465.359,4.401
bitcoin um,3467.52,4.319
and the you know the cut like the costs,3469.76,4.64
of doing a transaction the the dogecoin,3471.839,4.72
fee is is very low like right now if you,3474.4,4.159
want to do a bitcoin transaction the,3476.559,3.52
price of doing that transaction is very,3478.559,4.0
high so you could not use it effectively,3480.079,4.161
for most things,3482.559,3.681
um and nor could it even scale to a high,3484.24,4.96
volume um,3486.24,5.28
uh,3489.2,2.32
and when bitcoin was you know started i,3491.68,4.0
guess when around 2008 or something like,3493.92,3.36
that um,3495.68,4.32
the internet connections were much worse,3497.28,3.92
than they are today like order of,3500.0,3.04
magnitude cup,3501.2,4.399
i mean there's the way way worse you,3503.04,5.519
know in 2008 so so like having us you,3505.599,4.401
know a small,3508.559,4.081
uh block size or whatever is,3510.0,4.48
you know and a long,3512.64,3.919
synchronization time is,3514.48,5.119
made sense in 2008 but did you know 2021,3516.559,6.081
or fast forward 10 years it's like it's,3519.599,4.641
it's like,3522.64,4.24
comically low you know it's uh,3524.24,4.599
so,3526.88,3.52
um,3528.839,2.921
and i think there's some,3530.4,2.56
value to,3531.76,2.319
having,3532.96,3.52
a linear increase in the amount of,3534.079,6.081
currency that uh is generated um,3536.48,5.359
so because some amount of the currency,3540.16,2.72
like like,3541.839,4.72
if a currency is too deflationary or,3542.88,6.0
like uh or should say if if,3546.559,5.121
if if a currency is expected to increase,3548.88,4.8
in value over time there's reluctance to,3551.68,3.28
spend it,3553.68,3.04
because they're like oh i if i,3554.96,3.52
i'll just hold it and not spend it,3556.72,3.44
because it's scarcity is increasing with,3558.48,4.0
time so if i spend it now then i will,3560.16,4.56
regret spending it so i will just you,3562.48,5.28
know total it,3564.72,3.04
but if there's,3567.839,2.96
some dilution of the currency occurring,3569.2,3.119
over time that's that's more of an,3570.799,4.0
incentive to use that as a currency so,3572.319,5.52
um those coins somewhat randomly has,3574.799,3.841
uh,3577.839,2.0
a,3578.64,2.479
um,3579.839,3.52
just a fixed a number of,3581.119,3.041
of,3583.359,4.081
sort of coins or hash strings that,3584.16,4.159
uh,3587.44,2.48
are generated every year so there's,3588.319,3.441
there's some inflation but it's not a,3589.92,4.72
percentage base it's a it's so the,3591.76,6.079
it's a fixed number so the percentage of,3594.64,4.88
inflation will necessarily decline over,3597.839,2.881
time,3599.52,3.039
um,3600.72,4.24
so it just i'm not saying that it's like,3602.559,5.121
the ideal system for a currency but i,3604.96,4.639
think it actually is uh just,3607.68,4.24
fundamentally better than,3609.599,5.52
anything else i've seen just by accident,3611.92,7.76
um so i like how you said um around 2008,3615.119,6.641
so you're not uh,3619.68,3.84
you know some people suggested you might,3621.76,3.68
be satoshi nakamoto you previously said,3623.52,4.88
you're not i'm not,3625.44,2.96
would you tell us if you were yes okay,3628.64,4.159
uh do you think it's a feature of bug,3633.04,5.68
that he's anonymous or she or they,3634.72,6.079
it's an interesting kind of quirk of,3638.72,3.839
human history that there is a particular,3640.799,4.081
technology that is a completely,3642.559,5.361
anonymous inventor,3644.88,3.04
or creator,3648.799,3.32
well i mean you can you can look at the,3663.28,3.2
um,3665.359,3.681
evolution of ideas,3666.48,6.319
um before the launch of bitcoin,3669.04,5.36
and,3672.799,4.56
see who wrote,3674.4,2.959
you know about those ideas,3677.44,4.24
um and then,3680.0,2.96
i like i don't know exactly obviously i,3681.68,3.52
don't know who created bitcoin for,3682.96,3.839
practical purposes but,3685.2,3.76
the evolution of ideas is is pretty,3686.799,4.401
clear before that and like it seems as,3688.96,5.119
though like nick zabo uh is probably,3691.2,5.04
more than anyone else uh responsible for,3694.079,4.961
the evolution of those ideas so,3696.24,4.96
he claims not to be,3699.04,3.84
nakamoto but,3701.2,3.04
i'm not sure that's that's neither here,3702.88,4.0
nor there uh but he he seems to be the,3704.24,4.4
one more responsible for the ideas,3706.88,3.919
behind bitcoin than anyone else,3708.64,4.24
so it's not perhaps like singular,3710.799,4.401
figures aren't even as important as the,3712.88,4.0
the figures involved in the evolution of,3715.2,4.24
ideas that led to a thing so yeah yeah,3716.88,5.76
it's you know and most perhaps it's sad,3719.44,5.52
to think about history but maybe most,3722.64,4.399
names will be forgotten anyway what is,3724.96,4.0
the name anyway it's a name a name,3727.039,4.881
attached to an idea,3728.96,4.879
what does it even mean really i think,3731.92,3.919
shakespeare had a thing about roses and,3733.839,3.841
stuff whatever he said arose by any,3735.839,6.0
other name it smells sweet,3737.68,4.159
i gotta underquote shakespeare i feel i,3742.16,4.56
feel like i accomplished something today,3744.72,4.1
shall i compare it to a summer's day,3746.72,3.92
[Laughter],3748.82,4.539
i'm gonna clip that,3750.64,2.719
uh out,3753.52,1.92
more tempered animal fare,3754.0,4.96
[Laughter],3755.44,5.04
autopilot,3758.96,2.3
tesla,3760.48,5.41
[Laughter],3761.26,4.63
tesla autopilot has been through an,3766.0,3.119
incredible journey over the past six,3767.52,4.48
years um or perhaps even longer in the,3769.119,4.96
minds of in your mind in the minds of,3772.0,4.48
many involved,3774.079,4.161
uh i think that's where we first like,3776.48,3.28
connected really with the autopilot,3778.24,3.52
stuff autonomy and,3779.76,4.319
the whole journey was incredible to me,3781.76,3.359
to watch,3784.079,3.441
i was um,3785.119,4.48
because i knew well part of as i was at,3787.52,4.4
mit and i i knew the difficulty of,3789.599,4.161
computer vision yeah and i knew the,3791.92,3.36
whole i had a lot of colleagues and,3793.76,3.12
friends about the darpa challenge i knew,3795.28,3.6
how difficult it is and so there was a,3796.88,4.479
natural skepticism when i first drove a,3798.88,4.959
tesla with uh the initial system based,3801.359,4.401
on mobile eye yeah i thought there's no,3803.839,3.52
way,3805.76,3.68
the first one i got in i thought there's,3807.359,5.041
no way this car could maintain,3809.44,4.96
um like stay in the lane and create a,3812.4,4.399
comfortable experience so my intuition,3814.4,4.56
initially was that the lane keeping,3816.799,4.8
problem is way too difficult to solve,3818.96,4.879
oh thank you yeah that's relatively easy,3821.599,5.361
well yeah but like uh but not this but,3823.839,4.881
solve in the way that we just we talked,3826.96,3.839
about previous is prototype,3828.72,4.639
versus a thing that actually creates a,3830.799,4.401
pleasant experience over hundreds of,3833.359,5.2
thousands of miles or millions,3835.2,3.359
a lot of code around the mobile eye,3839.839,4.401
thing it doesn't just work by itself yes,3841.359,4.48
i mean there's part that's part of the,3844.24,3.2
story of how you approach things,3845.839,2.96
sometimes sometimes you do things from,3847.44,3.76
scratch sometimes at first you kind of,3848.799,4.32
see what's out there and then you decide,3851.2,3.919
to from scratch that was,3853.119,3.92
one of the boldest decisions i've seen,3855.119,3.601
is both on the hardware and the software,3857.039,3.841
to decide to eventually go from scratch,3858.72,4.16
i thought again i was skeptical whether,3860.88,3.439
that's going to be able to work out,3862.88,2.959
because it's such a such a difficult,3864.319,2.48
problem,3865.839,3.121
and so it was an incredible journey what,3866.799,4.161
i see now with um,3868.96,3.52
everything the hardware the compute the,3870.96,3.359
sensors the,3872.48,2.96
the things i,3874.319,3.601
maybe care and love about most is the,3875.44,4.48
the stuff that andre karpathy is leading,3877.92,3.919
with the data set selection the whole,3879.92,3.76
data engine process the neural network,3881.839,4.161
architectures the the way that's in the,3883.68,3.52
real world,3886.0,3.599
that network is tested validated all the,3887.2,4.32
different test sets,3889.599,4.081
uh you know versus the image net model,3891.52,3.839
of computer vision like what's in,3893.68,5.119
academia is like real world artificial,3895.359,5.361
intelligence so,3898.799,2.881
um,3900.72,2.879
andrei's awesome and obviously plays an,3901.68,3.679
important role but we have,3903.599,3.601
a lot of really talented people driving,3905.359,3.361
things so,3907.2,4.32
um and uh ashok is actually the head of,3908.72,4.96
autopilot engineering um,3911.52,3.12
uh,3913.68,3.28
andre is the director of ai ai stuff,3914.64,4.64
yeah yeah so yeah there's i'm aware that,3916.96,4.56
there's an incredible team of just a lot,3919.28,4.319
going on yeah just uh you know as people,3921.52,3.92
people will give off will give me too,3923.599,3.121
much credit and they'll give andre too,3925.44,3.119
much credit so,3926.72,4.24
and people should realize how much is,3928.559,4.641
going on under the yeah it's just a lot,3930.96,5.44
of really talented people um,3933.2,6.159
the tesla autopilot ai team is extremely,3936.4,4.48
talented it's like,3939.359,4.161
some of the smartest people in the world,3940.88,4.239
so yeah we're getting it done,3943.52,4.0
what are some insights you've gained,3945.119,4.0
over those,3947.52,4.64
five six years of autopilot about the,3949.119,5.841
problem of autonomous driving so,3952.16,4.639
you leaped in,3954.96,4.159
having some sort of first principles,3956.799,5.361
kinds of intuitions but nobody knows,3959.119,3.72
how,3962.16,3.04
difficult the problem yeah like,3962.839,3.72
i thought the self-driving problem would,3965.2,3.119
be hard but it's it was harder than i,3966.559,3.04
thought it's not like i thought it'd be,3968.319,2.561
easy i thought it'd be very hard but it,3969.599,2.0
was,3970.88,3.199
actually way harder than than even that,3971.599,3.841
so,3974.079,2.561
i mean what it comes down to at the end,3975.44,3.599
of the day is to solve self-driving,3976.64,4.8
uh you have to solve,3979.039,3.601
uh,3981.44,3.2
you you basically,3982.64,3.919
need to recreate,3984.64,3.919
um what you what humans do to drive,3986.559,3.921
which is humans drive with,3988.559,4.401
optical sensors eyes and biological,3990.48,3.76
neural nets,3992.96,3.76
um and so in order to that that's how,3994.24,4.319
the entire road system is designed to,3996.72,4.079
work with with uh,3998.559,4.161
basically passive optical,4000.799,3.441
and neural nets,4002.72,2.319
um,4004.24,2.559
it biologically um and now that we need,4005.039,4.08
to it so for actually for full-size,4006.799,4.081
driving to work we have to recreate that,4009.119,3.361
in digital form,4010.88,3.04
um so we have to,4012.48,5.92
um that that means cameras with uh,4013.92,6.48
advanced uh,4018.4,4.56
neural nets in silicon form,4020.4,3.6
uh,4022.96,3.359
and and then you it will obviously solve,4024.0,4.48
for full self-driving that's the only,4026.319,3.76
way i don't think there's any other way,4028.48,3.52
but the question is what aspects of,4030.079,4.0
human nature do you have to encode into,4032.0,4.0
the machine right so you have to solve,4034.079,4.641
the perception problem like detect,4036.0,3.92
and then you first,4038.72,2.48
well realize,4039.92,2.72
what is the perception problem for,4041.2,2.96
driving like all the kinds of things you,4042.64,3.439
have to be able to see like what what do,4044.16,4.32
we even look at when we drive there's uh,4046.079,4.081
i just recently,4048.48,4.24
heard andre talked about at mit about,4050.16,4.24
like car doors i think it was the,4052.72,3.52
world's greatest talk of all time about,4054.4,4.959
car doors yeah um the the you know the,4056.24,5.599
fine details of car doors like what what,4059.359,4.96
is even an open car door man,4061.839,5.121
so like the the ontology of that that's,4064.319,4.321
the perception problem we humans solve,4066.96,3.599
that perception problem and tesla has to,4068.64,3.52
solve that problem and then there's the,4070.559,3.201
control and the planning coupled with,4072.16,3.36
the perception you have to figure out,4073.76,2.88
like,4075.52,3.12
what's involved in driving like,4076.64,3.439
especially in all the different edge,4078.64,3.6
cases,4080.079,4.161
and and then i mean,4082.24,4.24
maybe you can comment on this,4084.24,4.799
how much game theoretic kind of stuff,4086.48,4.0
needs to be involved,4089.039,4.08
you know at a four-way stop sign,4090.48,5.2
you know our as humans when we drive our,4093.119,5.761
actions affect the world like sure it,4095.68,5.28
changes how others behave most,4098.88,4.479
autonomous driving if you,4100.96,4.48
you're usually just responding,4103.359,5.201
um to the scene as opposed to like,4105.44,5.6
really um asserting yourself in the,4108.56,4.4
scene do you think,4111.04,3.6
i think these actually i think i think,4112.96,2.879
these could these sort of control,4114.64,3.76
control logic conundrums are not are not,4115.839,3.761
the hard part,4118.4,2.24
um,4119.6,2.239
the,4120.64,2.079
you know,4121.839,3.52
let's see um,4122.719,4.241
what do you think is the hard part in,4125.359,2.88
this whole,4126.96,4.0
um beautiful complex problem so it's a,4128.239,4.641
lot of freaking software man,4130.96,5.839
a lot of smart lines of code um,4132.88,3.919
for sure in order to have,4137.199,4.16
um,4139.92,4.0
create an accurate vector space,4141.359,3.84
so,4143.92,2.64
like you,4145.199,3.281
you're coming from image space which is,4146.56,4.4
like this this flow of,4148.48,5.279
um photons you're going to camera,4150.96,5.199
cameras and,4153.759,3.92
and then uh,4156.159,4.241
so you have this massive bitstream,4157.679,3.6
um,4160.4,1.68
in,4161.279,3.92
image space and then you have to,4162.08,7.279
effectively compress uh the,4165.199,4.16
a massive,4169.44,3.399
bit stream,4170.799,5.281
uh corresponding to,4172.839,4.84
photons that,4176.08,3.679
knocked off an electron in a camera,4177.679,3.361
sensor,4179.759,4.08
uh and and turn that put stream into,4181.04,6.08
into vector space um,4183.839,5.92
i by by vector space i mean like,4187.12,4.4
uh,4189.759,3.281
you know you've got,4191.52,4.88
cars and and humans and uh,4193.04,6.4
lane lines and curves and,4196.4,4.08
uh,4199.44,3.36
traffic lights and that kind of thing,4200.48,3.52
um,4202.8,4.0
once you uh have an accurate vector,4204.0,6.32
space um the control problem is similar,4206.8,5.439
to that of a video game like a grand,4210.32,4.32
theft auto cyberpunk um if you have,4212.239,4.161
accurate best vector space it's the,4214.64,3.519
control problem is,4216.4,3.2
it's i wouldn't say it's it's trouble,4218.159,4.481
it's not trivial but it's um,4219.6,5.68
like it's it's it's it's a it's not like,4222.64,4.16
some,4225.28,3.6
insurmountable thing it's a it's but,4226.8,4.08
having accurate vector space,4228.88,4.24
is very difficult yeah i think we humans,4230.88,3.44
uh,4233.12,2.559
don't give enough respect to how,4234.32,2.96
incredible the human perception system,4235.679,5.04
is to mapping the raw,4237.28,5.04
photons to the vector space,4240.719,3.761
representation in our heads,4242.32,3.76
your brain is doing an incredible amount,4244.48,3.679
of processing um,4246.08,4.079
and and giving you an image that is a,4248.159,3.681
very cleaned up image like when we look,4250.159,4.241
around here we see like you see color in,4251.84,4.08
the corners of your eyes but actually,4254.4,4.4
your eyes have very few uh,4255.92,5.04
cones like the cone receptors in the,4258.8,4.64
peripheral vision your your eyes are,4260.96,4.56
painting color in the peripheral vision,4263.44,3.92
you don't realize it but their eyes are,4265.52,2.639
actually,4267.36,2.64
painting color and,4268.159,3.52
your eyes also have like this blood,4270.0,3.36
vessels and all sorts of gnarly things,4271.679,3.361
and there's a blind spot but do you see,4273.36,4.24
your blind spot no your,4275.04,4.88
your brain is painting in the missing,4277.6,4.24
the blind spot you're gonna do these,4279.92,2.799
like,4281.84,2.399
see these things online where you look,4282.719,3.52
look here and look at this point and and,4284.239,4.241
then look at this point and it's,4286.239,4.801
if it's in your blind spot it your brain,4288.48,4.0
will just fill in the,4291.04,2.48
the missing version,4292.48,3.04
the peripheral vision is so cool yes you,4293.52,4.0
realize all the illusions for vision,4295.52,3.92
sciences so makes you realize just how,4297.52,3.28
incredible the brain is the brain is,4299.44,3.279
doing crazy amount of post-processing on,4300.8,4.32
the vision signals from your eyes,4302.719,4.801
um it's insane,4305.12,3.119
so,4307.52,1.52
um,4308.239,2.561
and then and then even once you get all,4309.04,4.159
those vision signals uh your,4310.8,4.32
your brain is constantly trying to fig,4313.199,4.801
to forget as much as possible so human,4315.12,4.24
memory is,4318.0,2.48
perhaps the weakest thing about the,4319.36,2.48
brain is memory,4320.48,3.36
so because memory is,4321.84,4.64
so expensive to a brain and so limited,4323.84,4.8
your brain is trying to forget as much,4326.48,4.48
as possible and distill,4328.64,4.48
the things that you see into,4330.96,4.64
uh the smallest smallest amounts of,4333.12,4.079
information possible so your brain is,4335.6,3.68
trying to not just get to a vector space,4337.199,4.641
but get to a vector space that is the,4339.28,4.64
smallest possible vector space of only,4341.84,3.839
relevant objects,4343.92,2.56
um,4345.679,2.641
and i think like,4346.48,3.28
you can sort of look inside your brain,4348.32,2.399
or at least,4349.76,3.28
i can like when you drive down the road,4350.719,4.161
and and try to,4353.04,3.44
think about what your brain is actually,4354.88,2.48
doing,4356.48,2.32
consciously,4357.36,3.28
and it's conscious it's it's,4358.8,2.879
it's,4360.64,2.0
it's like,4361.679,2.801
you'll see a car that's you could,4362.64,3.92
because you're you don't have cameras,4364.48,3.36
you i don't have eyes in the back your,4366.56,2.639
head on the side you know so you say,4367.84,4.16
like but you you basically your your,4369.199,4.161
head is like a,4372.0,3.28
you know you basically have like,4373.36,3.839
two cameras on a slow gimbal,4375.28,2.959
um,4377.199,3.121
and and what's your,4378.239,3.761
and i say it's not that great okay you,4380.32,4.24
and i is uh you know like um and people,4382.0,3.92
are constantly distracted and thinking,4384.56,3.36
about things and texting and doing all,4385.92,2.96
sorts of things they shouldn't do in a,4387.92,2.96
car changing radio station,4388.88,3.839
so,4390.88,5.279
having arguments you know is like um,4392.719,4.161
so,4396.159,3.841
so then like say like like,4396.88,4.0
uh,4400.0,2.32
like when's the last time you look right,4400.88,4.319
and left and you know or and rearward um,4402.32,4.56
or even diagonally,4405.199,3.121
you know forward,4406.88,4.16
to actually refresh your vector space,4408.32,4.64
so you're glancing around and what your,4411.04,4.72
mind is doing is is is trying to distill,4412.96,3.6
um,4415.76,3.52
the relevant vectors basically objects,4416.56,4.8
with a position and motion,4419.28,3.52
uh,4421.36,2.56
and,4422.8,4.08
and and and then uh editing that down to,4423.92,4.88
the least amount that's necessary for,4426.88,4.96
you to drive it does seem to be able to,4428.8,5.359
uh edit it down or compress it even,4431.84,3.92
further into things like concepts so,4434.159,3.441
it's not it's like it goes beyond the,4435.76,4.08
human mind seems to go sometimes beyond,4437.6,3.52
vector space,4439.84,4.0
to sort of space of concepts to where,4441.12,4.559
you'll see a thing it's no longer,4443.84,3.6
represented spatially somehow it's,4445.679,3.361
almost like a concept that you should be,4447.44,4.719
aware of like if this is a school zone,4449.04,5.92
you'll remember that as a concept which,4452.159,4.241
is a weird thing to represent but,4454.96,3.92
perhaps for driving you don't,4456.4,4.0
need to fully represent those things or,4458.88,3.44
maybe you get those kind of,4460.4,3.839
um,4462.32,4.32
well you indirectly you need to like,4464.239,5.041
establish vector space and then,4466.64,3.76
actually have,4469.28,3.12
predictions for,4470.4,5.2
uh that those vector spaces so like um,4472.4,5.92
you know like if uh,4475.6,4.48
you know like you drive past,4478.32,2.879
say say,4480.08,2.639
a a,4481.199,4.721
a a bus and and you see that there's,4482.719,4.561
there's people,4485.92,2.799
before you drove past the bus you saw,4487.28,2.959
people crossing the interstate like or,4488.719,3.681
some just imagine there's like a large,4490.239,4.321
truck or something blocking site,4492.4,2.96
um,4494.56,2.72
but you before you came out to the truck,4495.36,3.92
you saw that there were some kids about,4497.28,3.28
to cross the road,4499.28,2.56
in front of the truck now you can no,4500.56,3.679
longer see the kids but you you need to,4501.84,4.319
be able but you would now know okay,4504.239,4.241
those kids are probably gonna pass by,4506.159,4.241
the truck and cross the road,4508.48,3.759
even though you cannot see them so you,4510.4,4.72
have to have um,4512.239,5.041
memory uh,4515.12,3.28
you need to remember that there were,4517.28,3.52
kids there and you need to have some,4518.4,4.799
forward prediction of what their,4520.8,4.16
position will be it's a really hard time,4523.199,4.241
of relevance so with occlusions,4524.96,4.32
and computer vision when you can't see,4527.44,4.0
an object anymore even when it just,4529.28,4.24
walks behind a tree and reappears that's,4531.44,3.44
a really really,4533.52,3.44
i mean at least in academic literature,4534.88,4.4
it's tracking through occlusions it's,4536.96,3.6
very difficult,4539.28,2.48
yeah we're doing it,4540.56,2.8
i understand this yeah,4541.76,3.36
so some of it it's like object permanent,4543.36,3.12
it's like same thing happens with the,4545.12,3.599
humans with neural nets like when like a,4546.48,4.56
toddler grows up like there's a there's,4548.719,3.921
a point in time where,4551.04,2.4
uh,4552.64,2.8
they develop they have a sense of object,4553.44,4.0
permanence so before a certain age if,4555.44,3.36
you have a ball,4557.44,2.719
uh or a toy or whatever and you put it,4558.8,3.84
behind your back and you pop it out if,4560.159,3.841
they don't before they have object,4562.64,2.8
permanence it's like a new thing every,4564.0,3.6
time it's like whoa this toy went poof,4565.44,3.84
just faired and now it's back again and,4567.6,2.8
they can't believe it and that they can,4569.28,3.04
play peekaboo all day long because this,4570.4,3.27
peekaboo is fresh every time,4572.32,3.76
[Laughter],4573.67,4.41
but then we figure out object permanence,4576.08,3.68
then they realize oh no the object is,4578.08,3.76
not gone it's just behind your back,4579.76,4.479
um sometimes i wish we never did figure,4581.84,4.399
out objective permanence,4584.239,4.96
yeah so that's uh,4586.239,5.361
that's an important problem to solve,4589.199,3.761
yes so so,4591.6,2.559
like an important evolution of the,4592.96,3.12
neural nets in the car is,4594.159,4.161
uh,4596.08,2.24
um,4598.56,2.56
memory card,4599.84,5.359
memory across both time and space um so,4601.12,5.68
now you can't remember like you have to,4605.199,2.801
say like how long do you want to,4606.8,3.12
remember things for and and it's it,4608.0,3.76
there's there's a cost to remembering,4609.92,3.84
things for a long time so you could you,4611.76,3.439
know like run out of,4613.76,3.28
memory to if you try to remember too,4615.199,3.201
much for too long,4617.04,3.44
um and and then you also have things,4618.4,4.08
that are stale if if they're,4620.48,3.44
remember them for too long and then you,4622.48,3.12
also need things that are,4623.92,4.64
remembered over time so even if you,4625.6,4.88
like say have like,4628.56,4.48
fragrance like five seconds of memory uh,4630.48,5.04
on a time basis but like let's say you,4633.04,4.72
you're parked at light and you and you,4635.52,3.76
saw,4637.76,3.28
you use a pedestrian example that people,4639.28,4.48
were waiting to cross the,4641.04,4.88
across the road and you can't you can't,4643.76,4.16
quite see them because of an occlusion,4645.92,2.799
uh,4647.92,2.799
but they might wait for a minute before,4648.719,3.761
the light changes for them to cross the,4650.719,4.161
road you still need to remember that,4652.48,4.32
that that's where they were,4654.88,3.52
um and that they're probably going to,4656.8,4.0
cross the road type of thing um so even,4658.4,4.72
if that exceeds your,4660.8,4.16
your your time-based memory should not,4663.12,3.2
exceed your space,4664.96,3.04
memory,4666.32,3.76
and i just think the data engine side of,4668.0,4.8
that so getting the data to learn all,4670.08,4.88
the concepts that you're saying now is,4672.8,3.68
an incredible process it's this,4674.96,4.0
iterative process of just it's this this,4676.48,6.32
hydrogen at many parts,4678.96,3.84
we're changing the name to something,4683.199,4.321
else okay i'm sure it would be equally,4684.8,4.96
as yeah rick and morty like there's a,4687.52,4.0
lot of,4689.76,4.72
we've re-architected the neural net uh,4691.52,4.8
the neural nets in the cars so many,4694.48,3.28
times it's crazy,4696.32,3.2
oh so every time there's a new major,4697.76,3.36
version you'll rename it to something,4699.52,3.12
more ridiculous or,4701.12,4.0
uh or memorable and beautiful sorry not,4702.64,5.2
ridiculous of course,4705.12,2.72
if you see the full the full like uh,4708.0,5.199
array of neural nets that that that are,4710.56,4.24
operating in the car it kind of boggles,4713.199,3.921
the mind there's so there's so many,4714.8,4.96
layers it's crazy um,4717.12,4.16
so,4719.76,2.399
yeah,4721.28,2.56
um but,4722.159,2.56
and we,4723.84,2.96
we started off with,4724.719,3.201
uh,4726.8,3.84
simple neural nets that were uh,4727.92,4.48
basically,4730.64,4.24
image recognition on a single frame,4732.4,4.08
from a single camera,4734.88,3.52
uh and then,4736.48,4.8
uh trying to knit those together with,4738.4,4.64
it you know it with the,4741.28,3.04
c,4743.04,2.48
i should say we,4744.32,3.2
we're really primarily running c here,4745.52,3.679
because c plus plus is,4747.52,3.04
too much overhead and we have our own c,4749.199,2.401
compiler,4750.56,3.04
so to get maximum performance we,4751.6,4.32
actually wrote rotor and c compiler and,4753.6,3.599
are continuing to optimize our c,4755.92,3.04
compiler uh for,4757.199,3.281
maximum efficiency in fact we've just,4758.96,2.56
recently,4760.48,3.84
uh done a new rev on a c compiler that,4761.52,4.56
will compile directly to our autopilot,4764.32,3.28
hardware so you want to compile the,4766.08,3.36
whole thing down and with your own,4767.6,4.88
compiler yeah like so efficiency here,4769.44,4.32
because there's all kinds of compute,4772.48,3.6
there's cpu gpu there's like basic types,4773.76,3.52
of things,4776.08,2.4
and you have to somehow figure out the,4777.28,2.8
scheduling across all those things and,4778.48,3.6
so you're compiling the code down yeah,4780.08,3.52
it does all okay,4782.08,3.599
this is so that's why there's a lot of,4783.6,4.16
people involved,4785.679,3.921
there's a lot of hardcore,4787.76,5.28
software engineering at a very sort of,4789.6,5.68
bare metal level uh because,4793.04,4.08
we're trying to do a lot of compute,4795.28,3.84
that's constrained to,4797.12,3.599
the,4799.12,3.84
you know our full self-driving computer,4800.719,4.561
so and we want to try to have the,4802.96,4.08
highest frames per second,4805.28,3.52
um possible,4807.04,2.88
um,4808.8,3.76
within a sort of very finite amount of,4809.92,4.56
compute um,4812.56,4.32
and power so,4814.48,5.6
um we really put a lot of effort into,4816.88,5.12
the efficiency of our compute,4820.08,3.52
um,4822.0,3.36
and and uh so there's actually a lot of,4823.6,3.76
work done by,4825.36,3.68
some very talented software engineers at,4827.36,3.12
tesla that,4829.04,4.08
uh at a very foundational level to,4830.48,4.8
improve the efficiency of compute and,4833.12,4.16
how we use the,4835.28,3.919
the trip accelerators uh which are,4837.28,4.24
basically um,4839.199,5.121
dot you know uh doing matrix math dot,4841.52,3.679
products,4844.32,2.8
like a brazilian dot products,4845.199,4.321
and it's like what what are neural nets,4847.12,3.44
it's like,4849.52,2.8
compute wise like 99,4850.56,3.679
dot products,4852.32,3.6
so,4854.239,2.641
you know,4855.92,2.799
and you want to achieve as many,4856.88,3.68
high frame rates like video game you,4858.719,5.041
want yeah full resolution,4860.56,5.28
high frame rate high frame rate low,4863.76,3.52
latency,4865.84,3.28
um,4867.28,5.12
low jitter uh so,4869.12,5.92
um,4872.4,4.56
i think one of the things we're um,4875.04,5.44
moving towards now is no post processing,4876.96,4.96
of the,4880.48,4.88
image through the um,4881.92,6.96
the image signal processor so um,4885.36,5.52
like for what happens for,4888.88,4.48
cameras is that almost all cameras is,4890.88,3.92
they,4893.36,2.4
um,4894.8,2.879
there's a lot of post processing done in,4895.76,4.56
order to make pictures look pretty,4897.679,4.0
and so we don't care about pictures,4900.32,3.839
looking pretty um we we just want the,4901.679,5.281
data we so we're removing just raw,4904.159,4.48
photon counts,4906.96,3.84
so the system will,4908.639,3.6
like the,4910.8,2.96
image that,4912.239,3.44
that the computer sees is actually much,4913.76,3.52
more than what,4915.679,2.96
you see if you're represented on a,4917.28,3.52
camera it's got much more data,4918.639,3.841
and even in very low light conditions,4920.8,3.52
you can see that there's a small photon,4922.48,3.92
count difference between,4924.32,2.879
you know,4926.4,2.239
this spot here and that's about there,4927.199,3.361
which means that so it can see in the,4928.639,3.921
dark incredibly well,4930.56,3.92
um because it can detect these tiny,4932.56,4.4
differences in photon counts,4934.48,4.4
like much better than you'd,4936.96,3.36
possibly imagine,4938.88,2.56
um so,4940.32,3.2
and and then we also save,4941.44,5.92
uh 13 milliseconds on a latency uh,4943.52,4.96
so,4947.36,3.279
um from removing the post processing in,4948.48,5.679
the image yes yeah it's like um,4950.639,5.04
because we've got you know eight cameras,4954.159,4.721
and and then there's uh,4955.679,4.321
roughly i don't know one and a half,4958.88,2.96
milliseconds or so,4960.0,5.199
maybe 1.6 milliseconds of latency um,4961.84,5.92
for each camera and so,4965.199,3.52
like,4967.76,1.68
uh,4968.719,1.841
um,4969.44,3.759
going to just uh,4970.56,5.28
basically bypassing the image processor,4973.199,4.561
uh gets us back 13 milliseconds of,4975.84,4.0
latency which is important,4977.76,3.52
um,4979.84,3.2
and we track latency all the way from,4981.28,3.439
you know photon hits the,4983.04,3.36
the camera to,4984.719,2.96
you know all the steps that it's got to,4986.4,2.88
go through to get you know go through,4987.679,2.48
the,4989.28,1.919
um,4990.159,2.721
the various neural nets and the the c,4991.199,3.361
code and,4992.88,2.88
there's a little bit of c plus plus,4994.56,2.24
there as well,4995.76,1.84
um,4996.8,3.359
well i can maybe a lot but it the the,4997.6,4.639
core stuff is the heavy duty computers,5000.159,4.881
will see um,5002.239,4.561
and uh,5005.04,3.52
and so so we track that latency all the,5006.8,4.56
way to an output command to the um,5008.56,4.8
drive unit to accelerate,5011.36,3.359
the brakes just to,5013.36,3.44
slow down the steering you know turn,5014.719,4.081
left or right um,5016.8,3.68
so because you got to output a command,5018.8,3.04
that's going to go to a controller and,5020.48,2.719
like some of these controllers have an,5021.84,3.76
update frequency that's maybe 10 hertz,5023.199,3.921
or something like that which is slow,5025.6,2.559
that's like now you lose 100,5027.12,3.039
milliseconds potentially,5028.159,3.201
so,5030.159,4.801
um so then we want to update the,5031.36,5.359
the drivers on the,5034.96,3.84
like steering and braking control to,5036.719,4.0
have um,5038.8,3.76
more like uh 100 hertz instead of 10,5040.719,3.201
hertz and you could have 10 milliseconds,5042.56,2.72
latency instead of 100 milliseconds,5043.92,3.44
worst case latency and actually jitter,5045.28,4.08
is more of a challenge than than latency,5047.36,3.44
because latency is like you can you can,5049.36,2.879
you can anticipate and predict but if,5050.8,3.359
you're but if you've got a stack up of,5052.239,3.761
things going from the camera to the to,5054.159,2.961
the computer,5056.0,3.28
through then a series of other computers,5057.12,5.039
and finally to an actuator on the car if,5059.28,4.8
you have a stack up of,5062.159,2.961
uh,5064.08,2.88
of tolerances of timing tolerances then,5065.12,3.68
you can have quite a variable latency,5066.96,4.08
which is called jetter and and that,5068.8,3.439
makes it,5071.04,4.4
hard to to anticipate exactly what how,5072.239,5.121
you should turn the car or accelerate,5075.44,2.799
because,5077.36,2.44
you know if you got maybe,5078.239,4.321
150 200 milliseconds of jitter then you,5079.8,4.68
could be off by you know after 0.2,5082.56,3.679
seconds and this can make this could,5084.48,3.36
make a big difference so you have to,5086.239,3.841
interpolate somehow to to,5087.84,4.96
to uh deal with the effects of jitter so,5090.08,4.72
that you can make like,5092.8,4.96
robust controlled decisions,5094.8,4.72
the again you have to uh so the jitters,5097.76,4.64
and the sensor information or the jitter,5099.52,5.44
can occur at any stage in the pipeline,5102.4,4.48
you can if you have just if you have,5104.96,5.279
fixed latency you can anticipate um,5106.88,7.12
and and uh like say okay we know that uh,5110.239,6.241
our information is for argument's sake,5114.0,4.88
150 milliseconds stale,5116.48,4.84
like so for um,5118.88,4.64
145 milliseconds from,5121.32,5.319
photons taking camera to um,5123.52,5.92
where you can measure a change in the,5126.639,4.801
acceleration of the vehicle,5129.44,4.239
um,5131.44,3.04
so,5133.679,2.881
then uh then you can say okay well we're,5134.48,3.04
gonna,5136.56,2.8
and we know it's 150 milliseconds so,5137.52,3.36
we're going to take that into account,5139.36,3.279
and uh,5140.88,3.6
and compensate for that latency however,5142.639,4.161
if you've got then 150 milliseconds of,5144.48,4.56
latency plus 100 milliseconds of jitter,5146.8,3.76
that's which could be anywhere from zero,5149.04,3.52
to zero to 100 milliseconds on top so,5150.56,4.32
then your latency could be from 150 to,5152.56,3.52
150 milliseconds now you got 100,5154.88,2.24
milliseconds that you don't know what to,5156.08,1.84
do with,5157.12,4.16
and and that's basically random,5157.92,4.96
so getting rid of jitter is extremely,5161.28,2.8
important,5162.88,2.799
and that affects your control decisions,5164.08,3.2
and all those kinds of things,5165.679,2.96
okay,5167.28,2.8
um yeah the car is just going to,5168.639,2.801
fundamentally maneuver better with lower,5170.08,4.159
jitter um,5171.44,2.799
the cars will maneuver with superhuman,5174.48,3.84
ability and reaction time much faster,5176.159,4.08
than a human,5178.32,5.28
i mean i think over time the,5180.239,5.281
autopilot full self driving will be,5183.6,4.48
capable of maneuvers that um,5185.52,3.6
you know,5188.08,3.28
uh,5189.12,2.24
you know are far more than what like,5192.239,3.121
james bond could do in like the best,5193.92,3.2
movie type of thing that's exactly what,5195.36,4.319
i was imagining in my mind as you said,5197.12,4.64
um it's like an impossible maneuvers,5199.679,5.201
that a human couldn't do you know so,5201.76,5.76
well let me ask sort of uh looking back,5204.88,4.48
the six years looking out into the,5207.52,3.44
future based on your current,5209.36,3.52
understanding how hard do you think this,5210.96,4.48
is this full self-driving problem when,5212.88,5.04
do you think tesla will solve level four,5215.44,4.96
fsd,5217.92,2.48
i mean it's looking quite likely that it,5220.8,4.56
will be next year,5222.4,4.64
and what does the solution look like is,5225.36,3.839
it the current pool of fsd beta,5227.04,4.159
candidates,5229.199,3.761
they start getting greater and greater,5231.199,3.201
as they have been,5232.96,3.279
degrees of autonomy and then there's a,5234.4,2.799
certain,5236.239,2.96
level beyond which,5237.199,3.681
they can they can do their own they can,5239.199,3.601
read a book,5240.88,3.279
yeah so,5242.8,2.64
uh,5244.159,2.961
i mean you can see anybody who's been,5245.44,2.799
following the,5247.12,3.36
fossil driving beta closely,5248.239,4.801
will see that the um,5250.48,3.6
the,5253.04,3.119
rate of disengagements has been dropping,5254.08,3.2
rapidly,5256.159,3.281
so like a disengagement b where where,5257.28,4.0
the driver intervenes to prevent the car,5259.44,4.0
from doing something right uh,5261.28,3.919
dangerous potentially so,5263.44,4.4
um,5265.199,2.641
so the interventions,5269.52,3.84
you know per million miles has been,5272.0,3.679
dropping uh dramatically at some point,5273.36,4.24
the,5275.679,2.801
and that,5277.6,4.32
trend looks like it happens next year is,5278.48,4.96
the the the,5281.92,6.48
probability of an accident on fsd uh is,5283.44,6.799
uh less than that of the average human,5288.4,3.36
and then and then significantly less,5290.239,5.761
than that of the average human um so,5291.76,5.28
it certainly,5296.0,4.4
appears like we will get there next year,5297.04,4.639
um,5300.4,2.64
then of course,5301.679,2.881
that then there's going to be a case of,5303.04,2.96
okay we now have to prove this to,5304.56,3.36
regulators and prove it to you know and,5306.0,4.32
and we we want a standard that is not,5307.92,4.88
just equivalent to a human but,5310.32,3.919
uh much better than the average human i,5312.8,2.879
think it's got to be at least two or,5314.239,3.681
three times uh higher,5315.679,4.0
safety than a human so two or three,5317.92,3.52
times lower probability of injury than a,5319.679,2.801
human,5321.44,3.279
before before we would actually say like,5322.48,3.759
okay it's okay to go it's not going to,5324.719,2.401
be equivalent it's going to be much,5326.239,1.92
better,5327.12,4.079
so if you look uh 10 point fsd,5328.159,6.08
10.6 just came out recently 10.7 is on,5331.199,4.081
the way,5334.239,3.361
maybe 11 is on the way somewhere in the,5335.28,5.12
future yeah um we were hoping to get 11,5337.6,5.84
out this year but it's uh,5340.4,5.759
11 actually has a whole bunch of uh,5343.44,4.719
fundamental rewrites on the neural,5346.159,4.48
neural net architecture,5348.159,4.161
and some,5350.639,3.361
fundamental improvements,5352.32,2.96
in,5354.0,3.04
creating vector space,5355.28,4.24
uh so,5357.04,5.04
there is a some fundamental like leap,5359.52,4.48
that really deserves the 11. i mean,5362.08,4.72
that's a pretty cool number yeah yeah,5364.0,5.04
uh 11 would be uh,5366.8,4.24
a single stack for all you know one,5369.04,4.639
stack to rule them all um,5371.04,5.119
and uh,5373.679,4.0
but but there's just some really,5376.159,2.721
fundamental,5377.679,2.721
uh,5378.88,4.48
neural net architecture changes that are,5380.4,5.92
that that will allow for,5383.36,5.839
uh much more capability but but,5386.32,4.16
you know at first they're gonna have,5389.199,3.761
issues so like we have this working on,5390.48,4.48
like sort of alpha software and it's,5392.96,5.279
it's good but it's uh,5394.96,5.52
it's it it's basically taking a whole,5398.239,5.361
bunch of c c plus code and and deleting,5400.48,4.8
a massive amount of c plus plus go and,5403.6,3.2
replacing it with the neural net and you,5405.28,3.68
know andre um makes this point a lot,5406.8,3.439
which is like neural nets like kind of,5408.96,3.12
eating software,5410.239,3.841
you know over time there's like,5412.08,3.84
less and less conventional software more,5414.08,3.68
and more neural net we're just still,5415.92,3.68
software but it's you know,5417.76,3.28
still comes out the lines of software,5419.6,2.32
but,5421.04,3.84
uh let's just more more neural net stuff,5421.92,4.239
uh and less,5424.88,3.12
uh,5426.159,5.121
you know heuristics basically um,5428.0,5.12
if you're,5431.28,4.959
more more more uh matrix based,5433.12,5.28
stuff and less uh,5436.239,6.161
heuristics based stuff um,5438.4,4.0
and um,5442.56,2.639
you know like like like one of the big,5446.32,5.44
changes will be um,5448.8,5.359
like right now the neural nets,5451.76,4.64
uh will,5454.159,3.361
um,5456.4,5.36
deliver a giant bag of points,5457.52,6.159
to the c plus plus or c and c plus plus,5461.76,3.919
code yeah um,5463.679,4.401
we call the giant bag of points yeah uh,5465.679,4.721
and it's like so you go to pixel and and,5468.08,3.44
and,5470.4,2.56
something associated with that pixel,5471.52,3.76
like this pixel is probably car the,5472.96,4.8
pixel is probably lane line,5475.28,3.84
then you've got to assemble this giant,5477.76,2.56
bag of points,5479.12,4.559
in the c code and turn it into,5480.32,5.76
vectors,5483.679,2.401
and it does a pretty good job of it but,5486.96,2.88
it's,5488.88,2.08
it's a,5489.84,2.16
it's,5490.96,3.199
we want to just we need another layer of,5492.0,4.8
neural nets on top of that to take the,5494.159,4.321
giant bag of points,5496.8,4.16
and distill that down to,5498.48,5.679
uh vector space in the neural net part,5500.96,4.88
of the software as opposed to the,5504.159,2.801
heuristics,5505.84,2.72
part of the software,5506.96,3.44
this is a big improvement,5508.56,3.84
um you know that's all the way down it's,5510.4,3.839
what you want it's not even your only,5512.4,4.64
realness but it's it's it's uh this will,5514.239,5.361
be just a ga this is a game changer to,5517.04,4.8
not have the bag of points the giant bag,5519.6,4.8
of points that has to be assembled with,5521.84,5.92
um many lines of cfc plus plus uh and,5524.4,4.799
and have the,5527.76,3.2
and have a neural net just assemble,5529.199,4.161
those into a vector so so that the,5530.96,5.04
neural net is outputting,5533.36,4.4
um,5536.0,3.679
much much less data it's it's it's,5537.76,4.24
outputting this this is a lane line this,5539.679,4.0
is a curve this is drivable space this,5542.0,5.199
is a card this is a you know a,5543.679,5.04
pedestrian or a cyclist or something,5547.199,3.361
like that it's outputting,5548.719,3.281
um,5550.56,3.52
it's really outputting,5552.0,4.32
um profit vectors to,5554.08,3.28
the,5556.32,3.52
the cc plus less control control code as,5557.36,4.64
opposed to,5559.84,4.399
this sort of,5562.0,4.8
constructing the the vectors,5564.239,4.641
uh in c,5566.8,3.439
um,5568.88,2.72
which we've done i think quite a good,5570.239,4.4
job of but it's it's a it you're kind of,5571.6,5.2
hitting a local maximum on the how well,5574.639,3.761
the c can do this,5576.8,2.72
um,5578.4,3.2
so this is this is really this is really,5579.52,3.28
a big deal,5581.6,2.72
and and just all of the networks in the,5582.8,3.76
car need need to move to surround video,5584.32,4.0
there's still some legacy networks that,5586.56,5.36
are not surround video,5588.32,5.6
and all of the training needs to move to,5591.92,4.0
surround video and the efficiency of the,5593.92,3.84
training uh it needs to get better and,5595.92,2.88
it is,5597.76,3.08
and then we need to move everything to,5598.8,4.08
uh raw,5600.84,4.12
uh photon,5602.88,4.48
counts as opposed to um,5604.96,4.8
processed images okay so which is just,5607.36,3.92
quite a big reset on the training,5609.76,3.68
because the system's trained on post,5611.28,4.24
processed image images so we need to,5613.44,3.84
redo all the training,5615.52,2.719
uh,5617.28,3.52
to train against the the,5618.239,4.161
raw photon accounts instead of the,5620.8,4.16
post-processed image so ultimately it's,5622.4,4.08
kind of reducing the complexity of the,5624.96,4.719
whole thing so uh reducing reducing,5626.48,5.36
lines of code will actually go lower,5629.679,3.921
yeah that's fascinating,5631.84,3.68
um so you're doing fusion of all the,5633.6,3.52
sensors so reducing the complexity of,5635.52,4.0
having to deal with these cameras,5637.12,5.519
cameras really right yes,5639.52,3.119
um same with humans,5642.84,4.68
yeah well i guess we got years too okay,5645.28,3.359
yeah well we'll actually need to,5647.52,3.76
incorporate um sound as well um because,5648.639,4.881
you know you need to like listen for,5651.28,4.48
ambulance sirens or you know fire trucks,5653.52,4.159
you know uh,5655.76,3.6
somebody like,5657.679,2.881
you know yelling at you or something i,5659.36,2.56
don't know just that there's there's a,5660.56,2.8
little bit of audio that needs to be,5661.92,3.04
incorporated as well do you need a,5663.36,3.279
cookie bath break yeah we listen to the,5664.96,3.759
trolls take a break okay,5666.639,4.321
honestly frankly,5668.719,4.721
like the ideas are the easy thing and,5670.96,3.92
the implementation is the hard thing,5673.44,3.36
like the idea of going to the moon is is,5674.88,3.6
the easy part but going to the moon is,5676.8,3.76
the hard part it's the hard part um and,5678.48,3.679
there's a lot of like hardcore,5680.56,3.84
engineering that's got to get done,5682.159,4.56
at the hardware and software level uh,5684.4,5.92
likes it optimizing the c compiler and,5686.719,5.841
just you know uh,5690.32,4.16
cutting out latency,5692.56,3.2
everywhere,5694.48,2.56
like this is,5695.76,2.8
if we don't do this the system will not,5697.04,4.079
work properly um so,5698.56,4.32
the work of the engineers doing this,5701.119,4.401
they are like the unsung heroes you know,5702.88,4.72
but they are critical to the success of,5705.52,3.44
the situation,5707.6,2.72
i think you made it clear i mean at,5708.96,2.56
least to me it's super exciting,5710.32,3.04
everything that's going on outside of,5711.52,3.44
what andre is doing,5713.36,2.879
yeah just the whole infrastructure of,5714.96,2.8
the software,5716.239,2.96
i mean everything is going on with data,5717.76,3.919
engine uh whatever whatever it's called,5719.199,5.44
the whole process is just,5721.679,5.121
the scale of it is boggle's mind like,5724.639,3.841
the training the amount of work done,5726.8,3.359
with like we've written all this custom,5728.48,4.48
software for training and labeling,5730.159,4.801
um and to do order labeling auto,5732.96,3.759
leveling is essential,5734.96,3.199
um,5736.719,2.641
because especially when you've got like,5738.159,2.801
surround video,5739.36,4.4
it's very difficult to like label,5740.96,4.64
surround video from scratch is extremely,5743.76,4.32
difficult um,5745.6,3.84
like take a human,5748.08,3.2
such a long time to even label one video,5749.44,4.16
clip like several hours,5751.28,4.48
or the order label it,5753.6,4.24
basically would just apply like heavy,5755.76,3.28
duty,5757.84,2.56
uh,5759.04,3.119
like a lot of compute to the to the,5760.4,3.44
video clips um,5762.159,3.761
to pre-assign,5763.84,3.6
and guess what all the things are that,5765.92,2.96
are going on in the surround video and,5767.44,3.6
then there's like correcting it yeah and,5768.88,3.6
then all the human has to do is like,5771.04,3.76
tweet like say this you know chan adjust,5772.48,4.88
what is incorrect this this is like,5774.8,4.399
increasing increases productivity by,5777.36,3.839
effect 100 or more,5779.199,4.321
yeah uh so you've presented teslabot as,5781.199,4.161
primarily useful in the factory first of,5783.52,3.84
all i think humanoid robots are,5785.36,4.799
incredible from a fan of robotics i,5787.36,3.52
think,5790.159,3.601
uh the elegance of movement that cuba um,5790.88,5.68
the humanoid robots the bipedal robots,5793.76,5.6
show are just so cool so it's uh really,5796.56,4.0
interesting that you're working on this,5799.36,2.96
and also talking about applying the same,5800.56,4.079
kind of all the ideas of some of which,5802.32,4.0
we've talked about with data engine all,5804.639,3.441
the things that we're talking about with,5806.32,4.48
tesla autopilot just uh transferring,5808.08,4.639
that over to the just yet another,5810.8,3.68
robotics problem,5812.719,3.92
i have to ask since i care about human,5814.48,4.08
robot interaction so the human side of,5816.639,3.921
that so you've talked about mostly in,5818.56,5.119
the factory do you see it uh also do you,5820.56,4.8
see part of this problem that tesla bot,5823.679,3.681
has to solve is interacting with humans,5825.36,3.68
and potentially having a place like in,5827.36,3.04
the home,5829.04,3.199
so interacting not just sure not,5830.4,4.239
replacing labor but also like,5832.239,3.44
i don't know,5834.639,2.401
being a friend,5835.679,3.681
or an assistant yeah i think the,5837.04,4.4
possibilities are,5839.36,4.799
you know endless,5841.44,2.719
yeah i mean it's it's obviously like a,5847.04,4.96
it's not quite in tesla's primary,5849.6,3.84
mission direction of accelerating,5852.0,3.36
sustainable energy but,5853.44,3.12
it is a,5855.36,2.879
an extremely useful thing that we can do,5856.56,3.36
for the world which is to make a useful,5858.239,3.761
humanoid robot,5859.92,3.44
that is capable of,5862.0,4.719
interacting with the world and,5863.36,3.359
helping in in many different ways uh so,5867.199,6.161
certainly in fact reason and really just,5871.199,4.161
just i mean i think if you say like,5873.36,3.2
uh,5875.36,3.359
extrapolate to you know many years in,5876.56,3.52
the future it's like,5878.719,2.96
i i think,5880.08,4.8
uh work will become optional,5881.679,4.401
so,5884.88,3.04
like there's a lot of jobs that,5886.08,2.96
if you if,5887.92,3.36
people weren't paid to do it they would,5889.04,3.679
they wouldn't do it like it's not it's,5891.28,3.76
not fun you know necessarily like,5892.719,3.841
if you're washing dishes all day it's,5895.04,2.24
like,5896.56,1.679
you know,5897.28,2.32
even if you really like washing dishes,5898.239,2.641
you really want to do it for eight hours,5899.6,5.519
a day every day probably not so,5900.88,6.319
um and then there's like dangerous work,5905.119,4.321
and basically if it's dangerous boring,5907.199,3.841
uh has like,5909.44,3.44
potential for repetitive stress injury,5911.04,3.599
that kind of thing um,5912.88,3.52
then that's really where,5914.639,4.401
humanoid robots would add the most value,5916.4,4.08
initially,5919.04,3.119
um so that's,5920.48,5.52
what we're aiming for is is to um,5922.159,5.681
for the human robots to do jobs that,5926.0,3.679
people don't don't voluntarily want to,5927.84,3.04
do,5929.679,2.0
um,5930.88,2.16
and then we'll have to pair that,5931.679,3.201
obviously with some kind of universal,5933.04,4.0
basic income in the future,5934.88,3.52
so,5937.04,3.84
i think um,5938.4,4.0
so do you see a world when there's like,5940.88,5.279
hundreds of millions of tesla bots,5942.4,5.68
doing different performing different,5946.159,6.0
tasks throughout the world,5948.08,5.2
yeah i haven't really thought about it,5952.159,2.641
that far into the future but i guess,5953.28,4.32
that there may be something like that um,5954.8,4.96
so,5957.6,2.16
ask a wild question so,5960.239,4.561
the the number of tesla cars has been,5962.48,4.32
accelerating there's been close to 2,5964.8,4.16
million produced many of them have,5966.8,4.24
autopilot i think we're over 2 million,5968.96,3.36
now yeah,5971.04,2.56
do you think there will ever be a time,5972.32,3.6
when there will be more tesla bots,5973.6,5.88
than tesla cars,5975.92,3.56
yeah i i i i,5980.639,3.121
you know actually it's funny you asked,5982.4,2.719
this question because normally i do try,5983.76,2.479
to think,5985.119,2.161
pretty far into the future but i haven't,5986.239,3.601
really thought that far into the future,5987.28,4.16
with the with the,5989.84,5.6
tesla bot or it's code named optimus,5991.44,7.199
i call it optimus subprime,5995.44,3.199
because that's not it's not like a giant,5999.119,5.201
you know transformer robot um,6001.119,4.241
so,6004.32,2.56
uh,6005.36,3.44
but it's meant to be a general purpose,6006.88,3.52
help help robot,6008.8,3.839
um,6010.4,2.239
and and basically like like the things,6014.56,2.48
that were,6016.08,2.32
basically,6017.04,2.96
like tesla,6018.4,4.799
i think um is the has the most advanced,6020.0,4.88
real-world ai,6023.199,3.04
uh for interacting with the real world,6024.88,3.04
which we've developed as a function of,6026.239,3.841
to to make self-driving work,6027.92,4.239
um and so,6030.08,4.24
along with custom hardware and,6032.159,3.52
like a lot of,6034.32,3.6
you know uh hardcore low-level software,6035.679,4.081
to have it run efficiently and be you,6037.92,3.68
know power efficient because because you,6039.76,3.68
know it's one thing to do neural nets if,6041.6,3.2
you've got a gigantic server room with,6043.44,3.52
10 000 computers but now let's say you,6044.8,3.76
just you have to now distill that down,6046.96,2.48
into,6048.56,2.4
one computer that's running at low power,6049.44,3.92
in a humanoid robot or a car,6050.96,3.679
that's actually very difficult a lot of,6053.36,2.72
hardcore software work is required for,6054.639,2.321
that,6056.08,2.88
um,6056.96,2.719
so,6058.96,3.759
so since we're kind of like solving the,6059.679,5.361
navigate the real world,6062.719,4.801
with neural nets problem for,6065.04,3.92
cars which are kind of like robots with,6067.52,2.48
four wheels,6068.96,2.64
then it's like kind of a natural,6070.0,3.6
extension of that is to,6071.6,6.32
put it in a robot with arms and legs uh,6073.6,6.72
and actually you know actuators um,6077.92,4.64
so,6080.32,2.24
um,6083.119,4.641
like like the the two,6085.04,4.32
like the hard things are like you,6087.76,3.68
basically need to make the,6089.36,3.759
have the rower be intelligent enough to,6091.44,3.12
interact in a sensible way with the,6093.119,2.641
environment,6094.56,2.32
um,6095.76,3.28
so you need real real world ai and you,6096.88,3.12
need,6099.04,4.32
to be very good at um manufacturing,6100.0,5.04
which is a very hard problem tails is,6103.36,3.2
very good at manufacturing,6105.04,5.04
and also uh has the real world ai so,6106.56,6.079
making the humanoid robot work is,6110.08,5.44
uh basically it means developing,6112.639,5.04
custom,6115.52,5.119
motors and sensors,6117.679,4.401
that that are different from what a car,6120.639,2.401
would use,6122.08,1.92
um,6123.04,3.119
but we also we have,6124.0,3.92
um,6126.159,5.121
i think with the the best expertise in,6127.92,5.92
developing advanced electric motors and,6131.28,5.04
power electronics so,6133.84,4.48
it just has to be for,6136.32,5.6
humanoid robot application on a car,6138.32,3.6
still you do talk about love sometimes,6142.08,5.599
so let me ask this isn't like for like,6145.6,3.76
sex robots or something i love is the,6147.679,3.04
answer,6149.36,2.48
yes,6150.719,2.561
uh,6151.84,3.2
there is something compelling,6153.28,4.32
to us not compelling but we connect with,6155.04,3.52
the,6157.6,3.039
humanoid robots or even lego robots like,6158.56,4.48
with the dog and she shapes with dogs,6160.639,5.121
it just it seems like you know there's a,6163.04,5.04
huge amount of loneliness in this world,6165.76,4.32
all of us seek companionship and with,6168.08,3.52
other humans friendship and all those,6170.08,3.599
kinds of things we have a lot of here in,6171.6,4.96
austin a lot of people have dogs,6173.679,4.881
there seems to be a huge opportunity to,6176.56,5.28
also have robots that decrease,6178.56,5.04
the uh,6181.84,3.6
the the amount of loneliness in the,6183.6,4.639
world or help us humans connect with,6185.44,4.239
each with each other,6188.239,3.761
so in a way that dogs can,6189.679,4.56
um do you think about that we test about,6192.0,4.4
it all or is it really focused on the,6194.239,3.361
problem of,6196.4,3.36
of performing specific tasks not,6197.6,4.16
connecting with humans,6199.76,3.52
um,6201.76,3.6
i mean to be honest i have not actually,6203.28,3.919
thought about it from the companionship,6205.36,3.839
standpoint but i think it actually would,6207.199,4.0
end up being it could be actually a very,6209.199,3.601
good companion,6211.199,3.04
um,6212.8,2.24
and,6214.239,2.721
it could,6215.04,4.88
develop like a personality,6216.96,4.239
uh,6219.92,3.44
over time that is that is like,6221.199,4.161
unique like uh you know it's not like,6223.36,3.92
they're just all the robots are the same,6225.36,4.319
and that personality could evolve,6227.28,6.08
to be you know uh,6229.679,6.48
match match the the the owner or the you,6233.36,4.879
know or i guess,6236.159,4.321
the owner uh well,6238.239,4.0
whatever you want to call it uh the,6240.48,3.92
other the companion the other half right,6242.239,4.48
uh the same way their friends do see i,6244.4,5.12
think that's a huge opportunity i think,6246.719,4.48
yeah no that's interesting,6249.52,4.159
like um,6251.199,3.201
the,6253.679,2.881
because you know like there's a,6254.4,4.4
japanese phrase i like the uh,6256.56,4.159
wabi-sabi you know uh the subtle,6258.8,3.2
imperfections,6260.719,3.281
are what makes something special,6262.0,4.159
and the subtle imperfections of the,6264.0,3.92
personality of the robot,6266.159,3.681
mapped to the subtle imperfections of,6267.92,4.56
the robot's,6269.84,2.64
human friend i don't know owner sounds,6272.84,4.359
like maybe the wrong word but,6275.6,3.68
um,6277.199,4.161
could actually make an incredible buddy,6279.28,5.04
basically and in that way the r2d2 or,6281.36,5.12
like a c-3po sort of thing you know so,6284.32,5.52
from a machine learning perspective,6286.48,5.04
i think the flaws,6289.84,4.319
being a feature is really nice you could,6291.52,4.719
be quite terrible at being a robot for,6294.159,3.201
quite a while,6296.239,2.88
in the general home environment or all,6297.36,4.56
the in general world and that's kind of,6299.119,4.961
adorable and that's like those are your,6301.92,4.0
flaws and you fall in love with those,6304.08,3.84
flaws so it's it's,6305.92,3.759
very different than autonomous driving,6307.92,3.12
where it's a very high stakes,6309.679,3.361
environment you cannot mess up,6311.04,3.04
and so,6313.04,3.44
yeah it's more fun to be a robot in the,6314.08,3.44
home,6316.48,3.12
yeah in fact if you think of like c-3po,6317.52,2.88
and,6319.6,2.88
r2d2 yeah like they actually had a lot,6320.4,4.0
of like flaws and imperfections and,6322.48,3.84
silly things and they would argue with,6324.4,4.08
each other,6326.32,4.16
and um were they actually good at doing,6328.48,3.44
anything,6330.48,3.44
i'm not exactly sure,6331.92,3.84
they definitely added a lot to the story,6333.92,4.16
um,6335.76,2.32
but but there's they're sort of quirky,6338.239,3.681
elements and,6340.0,2.96
you know,6341.92,2.799
that they would like make mistakes and,6342.96,3.92
do things like it was like uh it made,6344.719,3.761
them,6346.88,3.839
relatable i don't know um,6348.48,3.759
endearing,6350.719,2.641
so,6352.239,2.48
so yeah i think that that could be,6353.36,3.839
something that uh probably would happen,6354.719,4.081
um,6357.199,3.841
but our initial focus is just to make it,6358.8,5.439
useful uh so that so,6361.04,4.56
um,6364.239,2.641
i'm confident we'll get it done i'm not,6365.6,3.599
sure what the exact time frame is but uh,6366.88,4.16
like we'll probably have i don't know,6369.199,3.601
a decent prototype,6371.04,2.639
towards the end of next year or,6372.8,2.56
something like that,6373.679,3.44
and it's cool that it's connected to,6375.36,3.92
tesla the car,6377.119,3.841
the so so yeah,6379.28,3.76
it's using a lot of you know it would,6380.96,4.88
use the autopilot inference computer and,6383.04,4.72
um a lot of the training that we've done,6385.84,3.839
for the four cars in terms of,6387.76,3.439
recognizing,6389.679,3.121
real world things could be applied,6391.199,3.761
directly to the,6392.8,4.48
to the robot um,6394.96,4.32
so it but but there's there's a lot of,6397.28,3.6
custom actuators and sensors that need,6399.28,3.12
to be developed,6400.88,3.6
and an extra module on top of the vector,6402.4,2.96
space,6404.48,2.48
uh for love,6405.36,4.56
oh yeah that's missing,6406.96,2.96
okay okay add that to the car too,6410.48,4.0
that's true,6413.119,2.241
um,6414.48,2.8
that could be useful in all environments,6415.36,3.359
like you said a lot of people argue in,6417.28,3.12
the car so maybe people can help them,6418.719,2.96
out,6420.4,3.44
uh you're a student of history fan of,6421.679,4.241
dan carlin's hardcore history podcast,6423.84,4.56
yeah that's great greatest podcast ever,6425.92,4.64
yeah i think it is actually,6428.4,4.4
i i it does it almost doesn't really,6430.56,4.079
count as a podcast yeah it's it's it's,6432.8,4.56
more like a audiobook yeah so you were,6434.639,4.321
on the podcast with dan i just had to,6437.36,3.6
chat with him about it,6438.96,3.6
he said you guys want military and all,6440.96,2.8
that kind of stuff uh yeah it's,6442.56,5.36
literally uh it was basically um,6443.76,5.28
uh,6447.92,2.96
i think it should be titled engineer,6449.04,4.48
wars uh essentially like like when,6450.88,4.56
there's a rapid change in the rate of,6453.52,2.96
technology,6455.44,2.64
then uh,6456.48,3.84
engineering plays a pivotal role in in,6458.08,3.92
victory in battle,6460.32,3.44
um,6462.0,3.36
how far in back in history did you go,6463.76,3.12
did you go world war ii,6465.36,2.96
uh it was mostly,6466.88,3.839
well it was supposed to be a deep dive,6468.32,4.64
on fighters and bomber,6470.719,4.641
uh technology in world war ii um but,6472.96,3.84
that ended up being more wide-ranging,6475.36,3.04
than that um,6476.8,3.28
because i just went down the total rat,6478.4,3.279
hole of like,6480.08,3.52
studying all of the fighters and bombers,6481.679,4.641
world war ii and like the constant rock,6483.6,5.68
paper scissors game that like you know,6486.32,4.48
uh one country would make this plane,6489.28,2.879
that would make a plane to beat that and,6490.8,2.96
that try to make plane to beat that and,6492.159,3.201
then,6493.76,3.2
and really what matters like the pace of,6495.36,5.04
innovation um and also access to high,6496.96,4.88
quality uh,6500.4,4.319
fuel and uh raw materials,6501.84,5.2
so like germany had like some amazing,6504.719,4.241
designs but they couldn't make them uh,6507.04,3.28
because they couldn't get their raw,6508.96,2.48
materials,6510.32,2.319
and uh,6511.44,2.56
they they had a real problem with the,6512.639,4.721
oil and and and uh fuel basically the,6514.0,5.84
fuel quality was extremely uh variable,6517.36,4.08
so the design wasn't the bottom that,6519.84,4.08
goes uh yeah like the us had kick-ass,6521.44,5.44
fuel uh that was like very consistent,6523.92,4.239
like the problems if you make a very,6526.88,3.52
high performance aircraft engine um in,6528.159,3.52
order to make high performance you have,6530.4,2.799
to um,6531.679,3.921
the the,6533.199,2.401
the fuel the aviation gas uh,6536.56,6.639
has to be a consistent mixture and uh,6539.199,6.48
uh it has to have a high high octane,6543.199,4.0
um,6545.679,2.801
like high octane is the most important,6547.199,2.641
thing but also can't have like,6548.48,3.84
impurities and stuff uh because you'll,6549.84,4.96
fill up the engine and and and german,6552.32,4.08
just never had good access oil like they,6554.8,3.839
tried to get it by invading the caucasus,6556.4,3.87
um but that didn't work too well,6558.639,3.04
[Laughter],6560.27,4.929
that never works well for him,6561.679,3.52
that's nice for you so they always was,6566.159,3.44
germany was always struggling with [ __ ],6568.239,3.36
with basically shitty oil um and then,6569.599,4.0
they could not uh,6571.599,4.08
they couldn't count on a on high quality,6573.599,3.841
fuel for their aircraft so then they had,6575.679,3.361
to add all they have all these additives,6577.44,3.04
and and stuff,6579.04,4.079
uh so um,6580.48,5.119
uh whereas the u.s had awesome fuel um,6583.119,3.761
and that provided that to britain as,6585.599,3.52
well um so,6586.88,3.759
that allowed the british and the,6589.119,3.841
americans to design aircraft engines,6590.639,4.241
that were uh super high performance,6592.96,4.88
better than anything else in the world,6594.88,4.56
and germany germany could could design,6597.84,2.56
the engines they just didn't have the,6599.44,4.159
fuel and then also the likes of the the,6600.4,5.199
uh the quality of the aluminum allies,6603.599,3.201
that they were getting was also not that,6605.599,4.161
great and so yeah did you is this like,6606.8,4.64
uh you talked about all this with dan,6609.76,3.76
yep awesome,6611.44,4.159
broadly looking at history when you look,6613.52,4.88
at genghis khan when you look at stalin,6615.599,4.881
hitler the darkest moments of human,6618.4,3.6
history,6620.48,2.96
uh what do you take away from those,6622.0,2.96
moments does it help you gain insight,6623.44,3.36
about human nature about human behavior,6624.96,3.199
today,6626.8,3.52
whether it's the wars or the individuals,6628.159,4.241
or just the behavior of people any,6630.32,5.56
aspects of history,6632.4,3.48
yeah i find history fascinating,6640.96,5.279
um,6643.92,2.319
there's a lot of incredible things that,6649.599,4.401
have been done good and bad um,6651.199,5.361
that they,6654.0,2.56
help,6656.88,2.239
help you understand,6657.599,3.12
the nature of,6659.119,4.321
civilization um,6660.719,5.361
and individuals and,6663.44,4.08
does it make you sad that humans do,6666.08,3.44
these kinds of things to each other you,6667.52,5.599
look at the 20th century world war ii,6669.52,6.159
the cruelty the abuse of power,6673.119,4.08
talk about,6675.679,4.801
communism marxism and stalin um,6677.199,4.96
i mean some of these things do i mean if,6680.48,2.639
you,6682.159,3.121
like there's a lot of human history um,6683.119,3.441
most of it is,6685.28,2.319
actually people just getting on with,6686.56,2.96
their lives uh you know and and it's not,6687.599,2.961
like,6689.52,2.8
human history is just,6690.56,4.4
uh what nonstop war and,6692.32,5.12
disaster is it's those are actually just,6694.96,4.159
those are intermittent and rare and if,6697.44,3.6
they weren't then,6699.119,3.52
you know humans would soon cease to,6701.04,2.48
exist,6702.639,3.121
um,6703.52,2.24
uh but,6706.4,2.88
it's just that wars tend to be written,6707.679,5.681
about a lot and whereas like uh,6709.28,5.76
something being like well a normal year,6713.36,2.799
where nothing,6715.04,2.639
major happened was doesn't get written,6716.159,3.361
about much but that's,6717.679,3.361
you know most people just like farming,6719.52,3.679
and kind of like living their life you,6721.04,3.44
know,6723.199,2.721
being a villager,6724.48,3.84
somewhere,6725.92,2.4
and every now and again there's a war,6729.04,4.4
and i think so,6730.56,2.88
um and um you know what i'll say like,6734.84,5.0
that,6738.639,2.96
there aren't very many books that i,6739.84,3.12
where i just had to stop reading because,6741.599,2.881
it was just too,6742.96,2.88
too dark,6744.48,2.639
but uh,6745.84,3.12
the book about stalin the court of the,6747.119,3.52
reds are,6748.96,3.84
i could have stopped reading it was just,6750.639,4.0
too too bad,6752.8,3.04
dark,6754.639,2.56
rough,6755.84,2.96
yeah,6757.199,4.0
um the 30s,6758.8,5.439
uh there's a lot of lessons there to me,6761.199,6.321
in particular that it feels like,6764.239,5.681
humans like all of us have that as the,6767.52,4.8
old soldier knits in line,6769.92,4.719
um that the line between good and evil,6772.32,4.319
runs to the heart every man that all of,6774.639,3.6
us are capable of evil all of us are,6776.639,3.281
capable of good it's almost like this,6778.239,3.841
kind of responsibility that,6779.92,4.48
um all of us have to,6782.08,3.519
to,6784.4,3.6
to tend towards the good and so like to,6785.599,4.481
me looking at history is almost like an,6788.0,3.36
example of,6790.08,4.0
look you have some charismatic leader,6791.36,5.44
that uh convinces you of things it's too,6794.08,4.24
easy,6796.8,3.839
based on that story to do evil onto each,6798.32,5.04
other onto your family and to others and,6800.639,4.401
so it's like our responsibility to do,6803.36,3.2
good,6805.04,2.72
it's not like,6806.56,3.039
now is somehow different from history,6807.76,3.359
that can happen again all of it can,6809.599,3.04
happen again,6811.119,3.841
and yes most of the time you're right i,6812.639,4.48
mean the optimistic view here is,6814.96,3.92
mostly people are just living life and,6817.119,4.801
as you've often memed about,6818.88,5.52
the quality of life was way worse back,6821.92,4.799
in the day and keeps improving over time,6824.4,4.4
through innovation to technology but,6826.719,4.721
still it's somehow notable that these,6828.8,4.16
blimps of,6831.44,4.96
atrocities happen sure,6832.96,7.279
yeah i mean life was really tough,6836.4,5.44
for most of history,6840.239,5.281
i mean really for most of human history,6841.84,6.399
a good year would be one where not that,6845.52,5.28
many people in your village died of the,6848.239,5.44
plague starvation freezing to death or,6850.8,5.6
being killed by a neighboring village,6853.679,4.161
it's like well it wasn't that bad you,6856.4,2.799
know it was only like you know we lost,6857.84,3.839
five percent this year that was uh,6859.199,4.161
yeah it was a good year you know that,6861.679,3.201
would be par for the course,6863.36,3.12
like just just not starving to death,6864.88,3.839
would have been like the primary goal of,6866.48,3.92
most people in through throughout,6868.719,3.52
history just making sure we'll have,6870.4,3.04
enough food to last through the winter,6872.239,3.44
and not get in our freezer or whatever,6873.44,2.49
so,6875.679,2.0
[Music],6875.93,3.99
um,6877.679,4.801
now food is is plentiful if i have an,6879.92,4.48
obesity problem um,6882.48,3.52
you know so,6884.4,3.68
well yeah the lesson there is to be,6886.0,4.4
grateful for the way things are now for,6888.08,4.8
for some of us,6890.4,5.36
we've spoken about this offline,6892.88,4.88
i'd love to get your thought about it,6895.76,4.0
here,6897.76,5.12
if i sat down for a long form in-person,6899.76,4.64
conversation with the president of,6902.88,3.92
russia vladimir putin,6904.4,4.239
would you potentially want to call in,6906.8,3.359
for a few minutes,6908.639,3.841
uh to join in on a conversation with him,6910.159,4.881
moderated translated by me,6912.48,6.96
sure yeah sure i'd be happy to do that,6915.04,5.84
you've shown interest in the russian,6919.44,2.48
language,6920.88,2.64
is this grounded in your interest in,6921.92,4.16
history of linguistics culture,6923.52,6.079
general curiosity i think it sounds cool,6926.08,6.639
sounds cool now it looks cool so uh well,6929.599,6.161
it's it's you know it's it's a,6932.719,5.92
it takes a moment to read cyrillic,6935.76,4.08
um,6938.639,2.96
once you know what the sort like,6939.84,4.16
characters stand for actually,6941.599,4.961
then reading russian becomes a lot,6944.0,3.84
easier because there are a lot of words,6946.56,3.28
that are actually the same like bank is,6947.84,2.48
bank,6949.84,2.48
[Laughter],6950.32,3.6
um,6952.32,3.12
and uh,6953.92,3.44
so find the words that are exactly the,6955.44,3.199
same and now you start to understand,6957.36,3.44
cyrillic yeah if you can if you can,6958.639,4.641
sound it out then yeah,6960.8,3.68
it's much,6963.28,2.56
there's at least some commonality of,6964.48,4.719
words what about the culture,6965.84,5.52
you uh you love great engineering,6969.199,4.161
physics there's a tradition of the,6971.36,4.0
sciences there sure you look at the 20th,6973.36,4.48
century from rocketry so,6975.36,4.0
you know some of the greatest rockets of,6977.84,3.839
the space exploration has been done in,6979.36,4.16
the soviet in the former soviet union,6981.679,4.721
yeah so do you draw inspiration from,6983.52,5.84
that history just how this culture that,6986.4,4.799
in many ways i mean one of the sad,6989.36,3.68
things is because of the language,6991.199,4.321
a lot of it is lost to history because,6993.04,4.48
it's not translated all those kinds of,6995.52,3.92
because it it is in some ways an,6997.52,4.24
isolated culture it flourishes within,6999.44,4.32
its within its borders,7001.76,5.04
um yeah so do you draw inspiration from,7003.76,5.839
those folks from from the history of,7006.8,4.48
science engineering there,7009.599,5.361
i mean the soviet union russia and,7011.28,5.439
ukraine as well,7014.96,3.12
and uh,7016.719,2.88
have a really,7018.08,4.079
strong history in space flight like some,7019.599,4.56
of the most advanced and impressive,7022.159,5.601
things in history were done uh,7024.159,7.04
you know by the soviet union um,7027.76,3.61
so,7031.199,2.241
[Music],7031.37,3.43
um,7033.44,4.4
one can cannot help but admire the,7034.8,4.319
impressive rocket technology that was,7037.84,2.24
developed,7039.119,2.961
um,7040.08,3.039
you know after the sort of fall of,7042.08,2.559
soviet union the,7043.119,2.961
there there's,7044.639,2.321
the,7046.08,2.32
there's much less that that that,7046.96,2.32
happened,7048.4,2.319
um,7049.28,4.08
but uh,7050.719,2.641
still things are happening but it's not,7053.44,3.44
not quite at the,7055.119,5.441
um frenetic piece that was happening,7056.88,3.68
before the soviet union kind of,7060.8,6.08
dissolved into separate republics,7063.84,5.44
yeah i mean i i you know there's ross,7066.88,3.839
cosmos the russian,7069.28,3.839
agency a um,7070.719,4.561
i look forward to a time when those,7073.119,3.441
countries with china are working,7075.28,3.439
together uh in the united states they're,7076.56,4.0
all working together maybe a little bit,7078.719,3.201
of friendly competition but i think,7080.56,4.159
friendly competition is good um,7081.92,4.4
you know governments are slow and the,7084.719,3.121
only thing slower than one government is,7086.32,4.319
a collection of governments,7087.84,2.799
so,7090.96,1.84
yeah,7092.0,2.56
the olympics would be boring if everyone,7092.8,2.96
just crossed the finishing line at the,7094.56,3.92
same time yeah nobody would watch yeah,7095.76,5.359
uh and and people wouldn't try hard to,7098.48,5.119
run fast and stuff so i think friendly,7101.119,5.12
competition is a good thing,7103.599,4.0
uh this is also a good place to give a,7106.239,3.201
shout out to a video titled the entire,7107.599,4.161
soviet rocket engine family tree by tim,7109.44,5.12
dodd aka everyday astronaut it's like an,7111.76,4.8
hour and a half it gives a full history,7114.56,3.92
of soviet rockets,7116.56,3.44
and people should definitely go check,7118.48,3.28
out and support tim in general that guy,7120.0,4.4
is super excited about the future super,7121.76,4.56
excited about space flight every time i,7124.4,3.6
see anything by him i just have a stupid,7126.32,3.6
smile on my face because he's so excited,7128.0,3.04
about stuff,7129.92,2.88
yeah i love people like dad is real,7131.04,3.28
really great if you're interested in,7132.8,4.16
anything to do with space um he's in,7134.32,4.64
terms of uh explaining,7136.96,4.239
rocket technology to your average person,7138.96,4.639
he's awesome the best i'd say,7141.199,3.841
um,7143.599,2.801
and um,7145.04,2.72
i should say like the,7146.4,2.88
part reason like uh,7147.76,4.08
i switched us from,7149.28,3.839
like rafter at one point was gonna be a,7151.84,2.64
hydrogen engine,7153.119,2.56
um,7154.48,2.8
but but hydrogen has a lot of challenges,7155.679,3.52
it's very low density it's a it's a deep,7157.28,3.919
cryogen so it's only liquid at a very,7159.199,4.0
you know very close to absolute zero,7161.199,5.361
requires a lot of insulation it's um,7163.199,7.281
so it is a lot of challenges there,7166.56,5.119
and um,7170.48,2.88
and i was actually reading a bit about,7171.679,4.801
uh russian rocket engine development and,7173.36,4.08
um,7176.48,2.48
at least the impression i had was that,7177.44,3.12
that uh,7178.96,4.08
soviet union russia and ukraine uh,7180.56,4.4
primarily were,7183.04,4.32
uh actually in the process of,7184.96,5.36
uh switching to meth methylox,7187.36,5.759
um and there were some interesting tests,7190.32,4.08
and data for,7193.119,4.0
isp like they were able to get like,7194.4,5.92
up to like a 380 second isp with the,7197.119,4.961
meth lux engine and i was like whoa okay,7200.32,3.279
that's,7202.08,4.88
that's actually really impressive so,7203.599,5.12
um,7206.96,3.12
so i think we could you could actually,7208.719,3.841
get,7210.08,4.96
a much lower cost like in optimizing,7212.56,3.92
cost per ton to orbit cost per time to,7215.04,3.76
mars,7216.48,2.32
it's uh,7218.88,3.279
i think,7219.92,2.239
methane auction is the way to go,7222.639,4.881
and i was partly inspired by the russian,7225.04,5.04
work on the test stands uh,7227.52,5.04
with methodolox engines,7230.08,3.76
and now for something completely,7232.56,2.639
different,7233.84,4.48
do you mind doing a bit of a meme review,7235.199,4.96
in the spirit of the great the powerful,7238.32,3.2
pewdiepie,7240.159,3.201
let's say one to eleven just go over a,7241.52,4.0
few documents print it out,7243.36,5.839
we can try let's try this,7245.52,3.679
i present to you document,7249.52,5.4
numero uno,7251.52,3.4
okay,7257.599,3.52
vladimi paler discovers,7258.719,5.121
marshmallows,7261.119,5.441
that's so bad,7263.84,2.72
so,7267.04,3.599
you get it because uh yes are you,7268.88,4.239
failing things it's like i know three,7270.639,3.921
whatever,7273.119,4.241
that's not very good,7274.56,2.8
this is uh grounded in some engineering,7279.119,6.0
some history,7282.48,2.639
uh yeah give us an eight out of ten,7288.32,4.64
what do you think about nuclear power,7291.04,4.079
i'm in favor of nuclear power i think,7292.96,4.48
it's uh,7295.119,4.961
i i in a place that is not subject to,7297.44,5.199
extreme natural disasters i think it's a,7300.08,5.039
nuclear power is a great way to generate,7302.639,4.801
uh electricity,7305.119,4.161
um i i don't think we should be shutting,7307.44,4.32
down nuclear power stations,7309.28,4.8
yeah but what about chernobyl,7311.76,3.68
exactly,7314.08,3.119
um,7315.44,1.97
so,7317.199,1.361
[Music],7317.41,2.99
uh i think people there's like a lot of,7318.56,5.599
fear of radiation and stuff um,7320.4,4.799
and it's,7324.159,2.641
i guess what the problem is like a lot,7325.199,3.121
of people just don't,7326.8,2.56
unders,7328.32,2.799
they didn't study,7329.36,3.44
engineering or physics so they don't,7331.119,3.761
it's just the word radiation just sounds,7332.8,4.16
scary you know so they don't they ha,7334.88,3.68
they can't calibrate what radiation,7336.96,3.84
means,7338.56,2.24
but radiation is much less dangerous,7340.88,5.839
than than you'd think,7343.36,3.359
so,7346.8,2.16
like for example fukushima you know um,7350.159,6.08
when the fukushima uh problem happened,7354.32,4.16
uh,7356.239,4.96
do the tsunami the,7358.48,5.119
i got people in california asking me if,7361.199,4.4
they should worry about radiation,7363.599,4.08
from fukushima i'm like,7365.599,4.801
definitely not not even slightly not at,7367.679,3.681
all,7370.4,3.68
that is crazy,7371.36,3.92
and,7374.08,3.599
just to,7375.28,2.399
show like look,7377.76,4.08
this is how,7379.119,4.881
like the dangers is so much overplayed,7381.84,4.08
compared to what what it really,7384.0,5.04
is that i actually flew to fukushima,7385.92,5.679
and actually i donated a,7389.04,5.44
a solar power system for water treatment,7391.599,5.761
plant and,7394.48,4.719
and i made a point of,7397.36,5.6
eating locally grown vegetables,7399.199,3.761
on tv,7403.599,4.441
in fukushima,7404.96,3.08
like,7408.639,2.721
i'm still alive okay,7409.52,3.599
so it's not even that the risk of these,7411.36,4.239
events is low but the impact of them is,7413.119,5.281
the impact is greatly exaggerated it's,7415.599,4.321
just human nature,7418.4,2.799
it's people who don't know what,7419.92,2.719
radiation is like i've had people ask me,7421.199,2.96
like what about radiation from cell,7422.639,3.52
phones according to causing brain cancer,7424.159,3.52
i'm like when you say radiation do you,7426.159,3.761
mean photons or particles then like that,7427.679,3.681
i don't know what what do you mean,7429.92,3.759
protons particles so do you mean,7431.36,3.12
uh,7433.679,1.601
if,7434.48,2.88
let's say photons what,7435.28,4.24
what frequency or wavelength and they're,7437.36,4.64
like no i have no idea um like do you,7439.52,3.92
know that everything's radiating all the,7442.0,2.719
time,7443.44,2.719
like what do you mean like yeah,7444.719,3.841
everything's radiating all the time,7446.159,5.281
photons are being emitted by all objects,7448.56,4.88
all the time basically so,7451.44,2.96
um,7453.44,3.199
and if you want to know what it's it's,7454.4,4.08
what it means to stand in front of,7456.639,3.44
nuclear fire,7458.48,3.199
go outside,7460.079,4.16
the sun is a gigantic,7461.679,4.321
you know thermonuclear,7464.239,4.48
reactor that you're staring right at it,7466.0,6.4
are you still alive yes okay amazing,7468.719,5.36
yeah i guess radiation is one of the,7472.4,5.199
words that can be used as a tool to to,7474.079,6.08
fear monger by certain people that's it,7477.599,4.321
and i think people just don't understand,7480.159,3.281
so i mean that's the way to fight that,7481.92,3.52
uh that fear i suppose is to understand,7483.44,3.12
is to learn,7485.44,2.719
yeah just say like okay how many people,7486.56,3.2
have actually died from nuclear,7488.159,3.361
accidents it's like practically nothing,7489.76,4.319
and uh say how many people have have,7491.52,4.0
died from,7494.079,2.801
you know coal,7495.52,3.76
plants and it's a very big number,7496.88,4.0
so,7499.28,3.76
like obviously we should not be,7500.88,3.44
starting up coal plants and shutting,7503.04,2.639
down nuclear plants just doesn't make,7504.32,2.48
any sense,7505.679,2.48
at all,7506.8,2.879
coal plants like i don't know a hundred,7508.159,4.401
to a thousand times worse for for health,7509.679,5.121
than nuclear power plants,7512.56,4.159
uh you want to go to the next one,7514.8,5.2
it's really bad,7516.719,5.041
it's uh that uh,7520.0,4.8
90 180 and 360 degrees everybody loves,7521.76,6.08
the math nobody gives a [ __ ] about 270.,7524.8,5.04
it's not super funny,7527.84,4.56
yeah i don't like two or three yeah um,7529.84,4.56
this is not a you know,7532.4,4.96
lol situation,7534.4,2.96
[Laughter],7540.02,5.099
that's pretty good the united states,7543.199,3.52
oscillating between establishing and,7545.119,3.921
destroying dictatorships it's like a,7546.719,4.241
metro is that a matchup yeah,7549.04,4.159
yeah yeah it's uh on a seven out of ten,7550.96,4.8
it's kind of true oh yeah this is uh,7553.199,5.601
this is kind of personal for me next one,7555.76,5.76
oh man this is leica yeah well no is,7558.8,4.319
this or it's like referring to like or,7561.52,3.92
something as like as like,7563.119,3.201
a,7565.44,3.36
husband husband yeah yeah hello yes this,7566.32,5.04
is dog your wife was launched into space,7568.8,4.16
and then the last one,7571.36,3.839
is him with his eyes closed and a bottle,7572.96,3.44
of vodka,7575.199,3.841
yeah like it didn't come back no,7576.4,4.16
they don't tell you the full story of,7579.04,2.88
you know what,7580.56,3.039
what the love the impact they had on the,7581.92,4.4
loved ones yeah true that one gets an 11,7583.599,4.56
for me,7586.32,4.08
oh yeah it just keeps going,7588.159,4.801
on the russian theme,7590.4,4.319
first man in space,7592.96,3.84
nobody cares first man on the moon well,7594.719,5.841
i think people do care no i know but um,7596.8,6.24
there is uruguay gardens names will,7600.56,5.119
will be forever in history i think there,7603.04,5.679
is something special about placing like,7605.679,5.601
stepping foot onto another totally,7608.719,4.0
foreign land,7611.28,3.68
it's it's not the journey like uh people,7612.719,4.48
that explore the oceans it's not as,7614.96,3.84
important to explore the oceans is to,7617.199,5.281
land on a whole new continent,7618.8,4.96
yeah,7622.48,3.599
this is about you,7623.76,3.919
oh yeah i'd love to get your comment on,7626.079,3.361
this elon musk,7627.679,4.161
after sending 6.6 billion dollars to the,7629.44,4.32
u.n to end world hunger,7631.84,4.72
you have three hours,7633.76,3.919
um,7636.56,2.48
you know i mean obviously six billion,7637.679,2.721
dollars is not going to end with hunger,7639.04,3.52
so,7640.4,2.16
um,7642.8,2.399
so,7644.0,2.88
i mean the reality is at this point the,7645.199,4.081
world is producing uh,7646.88,4.799
far more food than it can really consume,7649.28,3.839
like we don't have a,7651.679,3.121
caloric uh,7653.119,3.281
constraint to this point so where there,7654.8,3.279
is hunger it is,7656.4,4.239
almost always due to um,7658.079,4.721
it's like like civil war or strife or,7660.639,4.48
some like um,7662.8,5.12
it's it's not a thing that is,7665.119,5.6
it's extremely rare for it to be just a,7667.92,4.319
matter of like,7670.719,3.92
like lack of money it's like,7672.239,4.48
you know it's like some to the civil war,7674.639,3.761
in some some country and and like one,7676.719,2.721
part of the country is literally trying,7678.4,2.56
to starve the other part of the country,7679.44,3.279
um,7680.96,3.679
so it's much more complex than something,7682.719,3.44
that money could solve it's politics,7684.639,4.241
geopolitics it's it's,7686.159,4.48
a lot of things it's human nature it's,7688.88,4.4
governments it's monies monetary systems,7690.639,3.921
all that kind of stuff,7693.28,3.839
yeah food is extremely cheap uh these,7694.56,4.159
days it's like it's,7697.119,3.6
um,7698.719,4.561
i mean the u.s at this point um,7700.719,4.721
you know among low-income families,7703.28,4.64
obesity is actually another problem it's,7705.44,3.52
not,7707.92,3.759
like obviously it's not hunger it's like,7708.96,5.199
too much it's you know too many calories,7711.679,4.48
uh so,7714.159,3.281
it's not that nobody's hungry hungry,7716.159,5.121
anywhere it's just it's just this is uh,7717.44,5.52
not not a simple matter of adding money,7721.28,4.319
and solving it,7722.96,2.639
what do you think that one gets,7726.239,5.321
just,7728.56,3.0
this is going after empires world uh,7733.679,3.761
where did you get those artifacts the,7736.0,3.28
british museum,7737.44,3.12
shout out to,7739.28,3.56
monty python we found them,7740.56,4.96
yeah the british museum is it's pretty,7742.84,4.68
great i mean yeah it admittedly britain,7745.52,3.679
did take uh these historical artifacts,7747.52,2.96
from all around the world and put them,7749.199,4.321
in london but uh you know it it's not,7750.48,3.759
like,7753.52,3.679
people can't go see them uh so it is a,7754.239,4.96
convenient place to see these uh ancient,7757.199,4.801
artifacts is is london for,7759.199,4.641
you know for for a large segment of the,7762.0,2.8
world,7763.84,2.56
so i think you know on balance the,7764.8,4.0
british museum is a net good,7766.4,3.839
although i'm sure a lot of countries,7768.8,3.68
argue about that yeah,7770.239,3.201
it's like you want to make these,7772.48,2.88
historical artifacts accessible to as,7773.44,3.52
many people as possible,7775.36,3.359
and the british museum,7776.96,4.239
i think does a good job of that,7778.719,4.4
even if there's a darker aspect to like,7781.199,3.52
the history of empire in general,7783.119,3.281
whatever the empire is,7784.719,4.801
however things were done,7786.4,3.12
this it is the history that happened you,7790.0,3.36
can't sort of erase that history,7792.0,2.8
unfortunately you could just become,7793.36,2.96
better in the future,7794.8,3.6
that's the point,7796.32,4.72
yeah i mean it's like well how are we,7798.4,3.44
gonna,7801.04,2.48
pass moral judgment on these these,7801.84,3.359
things like it's like if,7803.52,3.28
uh,7805.199,2.801
you know uh,7806.8,3.12
if one is gonna judge say the rosh,7808.0,3.679
empire you're gonna judge you know what,7809.92,3.44
everyone was doing at the time,7811.679,3.601
and how were the british relative to,7813.36,3.279
everyone,7815.28,2.64
um,7816.639,2.881
and i think they would british would,7817.92,3.12
actually get like a relatively good,7819.52,3.76
grade relatively good grade not in,7821.04,5.28
absolute terms but compared to,7823.28,6.399
what everyone else was doing um,7826.32,4.96
they were not the worst,7829.679,2.641
like i said you gotta look at these,7831.28,2.72
things in the context of the history at,7832.32,3.919
the time um and say what what were the,7834.0,3.679
alternatives and what are you comparing,7836.239,3.761
it against yes and i,7837.679,4.881
i do not think it will be the case that,7840.0,3.44
um,7842.56,2.72
britain would get a uh,7843.44,4.0
a bad grade in in when looking at,7845.28,4.0
history at the time you know if you,7847.44,4.56
judge history from,7849.28,4.0
you know,7852.0,2.079
from,7853.28,2.879
what is morally acceptable today you,7854.079,3.281
basically are going to give everyone a,7856.159,3.281
failing grade yeah i'm not clear it's,7857.36,3.279
not i don't think anyone would get a,7859.44,2.799
passing grade um,7860.639,4.241
in in their morality uh of like you go,7862.239,4.88
back 300 years ago like who's getting a,7864.88,3.6
passing grade,7867.119,3.361
basically no one,7868.48,4.48
and we might not get a passing grade,7870.48,4.719
from generations but uh that come after,7872.96,3.84
us,7875.199,3.601
uh what what does that one get,7876.8,3.279
uh,7878.8,3.439
sure uh success,7880.079,4.401
for the monty python maybe i always love,7882.239,4.0
monkey python they're great,7884.48,3.759
uh brian and the quest for holy grail,7886.239,4.241
are incredible yeah yeah yeah those,7888.239,4.161
serious eyebrows,7890.48,3.28
impressions,7892.4,3.12
like you know how important is facial,7893.76,2.8
hair to,7895.52,3.44
great leadership well you got a new,7896.56,4.96
haircut is that is that is this how does,7898.96,4.32
that affect your leadership,7901.52,4.079
i i don't know hopefully not,7903.28,4.959
it doesn't um,7905.599,5.681
yeah the second is no one,7908.239,4.4
there's no one competing with brush i,7911.28,3.04
have no one too those are like epic,7912.639,3.361
eyebrows,7914.32,3.44
so,7916.0,3.52
sure,7917.76,3.359
that's ridiculous six or seven i don't,7919.52,4.079
know uh i like this like shakespearean,7921.119,4.801
analysis of memes,7923.599,5.6
he had he had a flair for drama as well,7925.92,4.4
like you know,7929.199,4.0
showmanship yeah yeah it must come from,7930.32,5.44
the eyebrows all right um,7933.199,5.281
invention great engineering look what i,7935.76,4.56
invented yeah that's the best thing,7938.48,3.44
since ripped up bread,7940.32,4.64
yeah because they invented they're just,7941.92,5.12
sliced bread am i just explaining memes,7944.96,4.56
at this point,7947.04,2.48
this is what my life has become,7949.679,5.721
um,7952.4,3.0
you know like a scribe that like runs,7958.239,3.44
around with the kings and just like,7960.239,2.88
writes down,7961.679,2.48
memes,7963.119,2.48
i mean when was the cheeseburger,7964.159,3.201
inventor that's like an epic invention,7965.599,3.281
yeah like,7967.36,2.719
like wow,7968.88,2.239
you know,7970.079,3.441
that was versus just like a burger or a,7971.119,4.241
burger i guess a burger in general it's,7973.52,3.76
like you know um,7975.36,3.279
then there's like what is a burger,7977.28,3.04
what's a sandwich and then you start,7978.639,3.52
getting as a pizza sandwich and what is,7980.32,3.04
the original,7982.159,3.121
it's it's it gets into an ontology,7983.36,3.359
argument yeah but everybody knows like,7985.28,2.64
if you order like a burger or,7986.719,2.4
cheeseburger or whatever you like you,7987.92,2.719
get like you know tomato and some,7989.119,3.281
lettuce and onions and whatever and you,7990.639,3.121
know,7992.4,3.12
mayor and ketchup and mustard it's like,7993.76,4.24
epic yeah but i'm sure they've had bread,7995.52,4.48
and meat separately for a long time and,7998.0,3.52
it was kind of a burger on the same,8000.0,3.44
plate but somebody who actually combined,8001.52,4.079
them into the same thing,8003.44,4.4
and yeah bite and hold it make makes it,8005.599,4.801
convenient it's a materials problem like,8007.84,4.319
your hands don't get,8010.4,5.52
dirty and whatever yeah it's brilliant,8012.159,3.761
well that is not what i would have,8018.239,2.721
guessed,8019.92,3.04
but everyone knows like you you if you,8020.96,2.88
order a cheeseburger you know what,8022.96,2.239
you're getting you know it's not like,8023.84,3.92
some obtuse like i wonder what i'll get,8025.199,4.721
you know um,8027.76,4.16
you know uh fries are,8029.92,3.04
i mean,8031.92,2.48
great i mean they were the devil but,8032.96,3.88
fries are awesome um and,8034.4,6.319
uh yeah chip pizza is incredible,8036.84,5.56
uh food innovation doesn't get enough,8040.719,2.641
love,8042.4,3.12
yeah i guess is what we're getting at,8043.36,4.4
it's great um,8045.52,4.88
uh what about the uh matthew mcconaughey,8047.76,5.52
austinite here uh president kennedy,8050.4,4.4
do you know how to put men on the moon,8053.28,4.0
yet nasa no president kennedy,8054.8,5.359
be a lot cooler if you did,8057.28,3.919
pretty much,8060.159,5.401
sure six six or seven i suppose,8061.199,4.361
that's the last one,8066.079,4.401
that's funny,8068.56,4.4
someone drew a bunch of dicks all over,8070.48,4.96
the walls sistine chapel boys bathroom,8072.96,3.92
sure i'll give it nine,8075.44,3.84
it's that's really true,8076.88,4.0
all right this is our highest ranking,8079.28,3.68
meme for today i mean it's true like how,8080.88,3.6
do they get away with that,8082.96,3.04
lots of nakedness,8084.48,3.04
i mean dick pics are,8086.0,3.679
i mean just something throughout history,8087.52,2.88
uh,8089.679,2.161
as long as people can draw things,8090.4,3.199
there's been a dick pic it's,8091.84,4.399
a staple of human history it's a staple,8093.599,5.04
consistent throughout human history you,8096.239,4.241
you tweeted that you aspired to comedy,8098.639,3.681
you're friends with joe rogan,8100.48,4.239
might you uh do a short stand-up comedy,8102.32,4.16
set at some point in the future,8104.719,4.4
maybe um open for joe something like,8106.48,4.639
that is that is that really stand-up,8109.119,3.681
actual just blown stand-up full-on,8111.119,3.361
stand-up is that in there or is that,8112.8,3.919
i've never thought about that,8114.48,5.36
um it's extremely difficult if,8116.719,5.281
at least that's what the like joe says,8119.84,4.72
and the comedians say,8122.0,5.52
huh i wonder if i could um i mean only,8124.56,4.8
one way to find out,8127.52,3.679
you know i i have done,8129.36,4.48
stand up for friends just uh,8131.199,4.4
impromptu,8133.84,4.0
you know i'll get get on like a roof uh,8135.599,3.441
and they,8137.84,4.399
they do laugh but they're friends too so,8139.04,4.72
i don't know if if you gotta call you,8142.239,3.041
know like a rumor strangers are they,8143.76,3.919
gonna actually also find it funny but,8145.28,4.399
i could try,8147.679,3.601
see what happens,8149.679,3.92
i think you'd learn something either way,8151.28,5.12
um yeah i kind of love um,8153.599,5.201
both the when you bomb and when when you,8156.4,4.4
do great just watching people how they,8158.8,5.12
deal with it is so difficult it's so,8160.8,5.04
you're so fragile,8163.92,4.239
up there it's just you,8165.84,3.759
and you you think you're gonna be funny,8168.159,3.121
and when it completely falls flat it's,8169.599,3.761
just it's beautiful to see people,8171.28,4.319
deal with like that uh you might have,8173.36,4.4
enough material to do standard,8175.599,4.241
no no i've never thought about but i,8177.76,5.6
might have enough material um,8179.84,4.799
i don't know like 15 minutes or,8183.36,3.6
something oh yeah yeah do it do a,8184.639,4.0
netflix special,8186.96,3.88
netflix special sure,8188.639,4.561
um what's your favorite rick and morty,8190.84,4.12
concept uh,8193.2,3.359
just to spring that on you is there,8194.96,2.96
there's a lot of sort of scientific,8196.559,3.361
engineering ideas explored there there's,8197.92,4.799
the favorite one that's the butter robot,8199.92,4.639
it's great uh yeah it's a great show,8202.719,2.72
yeah,8204.559,2.481
dragon ball is awesome,8205.439,3.28
somebody that's exactly like you from an,8207.04,3.679
alternate dimension showed up there elon,8208.719,3.201
tusk,8210.719,3.281
yeah that's right that you voiced yeah,8211.92,3.92
rick morty suddenly explores a lot of,8214.0,4.24
interesting concepts,8215.84,4.32
i so like what's your favorite one i,8218.24,3.6
know the the butter robot certainly is,8220.16,2.64
uh,8221.84,2.4
you know it's like it it's certainly,8222.8,3.36
possible to have too much sentience in a,8224.24,2.88
device,8226.16,2.319
um like you don't want to have your,8227.12,2.96
toast to be like,8228.479,4.321
a super genius toaster it's gonna hate,8230.08,4.239
hate life because well it could just,8232.8,3.519
make us toast but if you know it's like,8234.319,2.881
you don't want to have like super,8236.319,2.641
intelligent stuck in a,8237.2,4.159
a very limited device um do you think,8238.96,4.559
it's too easy from uh if we talk about,8241.359,3.681
from the engineering perspective of,8243.519,3.601
super intelligence like with marvin the,8245.04,5.439
robot like is it j it seems like it,8247.12,5.279
might be very easy to engineer just a,8250.479,3.441
depressed robot,8252.399,3.441
like it sure it's not obvious to,8253.92,4.479
engineer a robot that's going to,8255.84,4.639
find a fulfilling existence,8258.399,4.24
same as humans i suppose,8260.479,3.761
but um,8262.639,3.92
i wonder if that's like the default,8264.24,4.72
if you don't do a good job on building a,8266.559,5.92
robot it's going to be sad a lot,8268.96,6.16
well we can reprogram robots easier than,8272.479,5.441
we can reprogram humans,8275.12,4.64
so,8277.92,3.84
i guess if you let it evolve,8279.76,3.12
without,8281.76,3.36
tinkering then it might get sad,8282.88,4.16
but you can change the optimization,8285.12,2.88
function,8287.04,1.76
and,8288.0,3.84
have it be a cheery robot,8288.8,3.04
you uh like i mentioned with with spacex,8292.8,4.559
you give a lot of people hope and a lot,8295.519,3.12
of people look up to you millions of,8297.359,3.36
people look up to you uh if we think,8298.639,4.0
about young people,8300.719,4.561
in high school maybe in college,8302.639,5.121
um what advice would you give to them,8305.28,3.92
about,8307.76,3.2
if they want to try to do something big,8309.2,3.199
in this world they want to really have a,8310.96,3.04
big positive impact what advice would,8312.399,3.92
you give them about their career maybe,8314.0,5.2
about life in general,8316.319,4.561
try to be useful,8319.2,2.64
um,8320.88,2.719
you do things that are useful to your,8321.84,4.4
fellow human beings to the world,8323.599,4.8
it's very hard to be useful,8326.24,4.479
um,8328.399,2.32
very hard,8331.04,3.84
um you know are you contributing more,8332.719,3.6
than you,8334.88,4.4
consume you know like uh,8336.319,5.681
like can you,8339.28,5.199
try to have a positive net contribution,8342.0,5.519
to society um,8344.479,4.88
i think that's the thing to aim for you,8347.519,4.16
know not to try to be sort of a leader,8349.359,3.12
for,8351.679,2.401
just for the sake of being a leader or,8352.479,4.321
whatever um,8354.08,5.359
a lot of time people who,8356.8,4.08
a lot of times the people you want as,8359.439,2.88
leaders are other people who don't want,8360.88,3.36
to be leaders,8362.319,2.091
so,8364.24,2.0
[Music],8364.41,4.069
um,8366.24,2.239
if you live a useful life,8369.12,4.559
that is a good life,8372.08,3.2
a life worth,8373.679,3.441
having lived,8375.28,2.96
um,8377.12,3.199
you know and i like i said,8378.24,3.62
i would encourage people to,8380.319,3.601
[Music],8381.86,4.459
use the mental tools of physics and,8383.92,4.639
apply them broadly in life there are the,8386.319,4.0
best tools when you think about,8388.559,4.081
education and self-education what do you,8390.319,3.441
recommend,8392.64,4.16
so there's the university there's,8393.76,4.96
uh self-study,8396.8,5.2
there is a hands-on sort of finding a,8398.72,5.12
company or a place or a set of people,8402.0,3.12
that do the thing you're passionate,8403.84,2.72
about and joining them as early as,8405.12,2.64
possible,8406.56,2.24
um,8407.76,3.12
there's uh taking a road trip across,8408.8,3.76
europe for a few years and writing some,8410.88,4.24
poetry which uh which which trajectory,8412.56,5.44
do you suggest,8415.12,5.12
for in terms of learning about,8418.0,4.72
how you can become useful as you,8420.24,3.92
mentioned how you can have the most,8422.72,4.84
positive impact,8424.16,3.4
but i encourage people to read a lot of,8432.479,3.201
books,8434.16,3.52
just re like,8435.68,3.759
basically try to ingest as much,8437.68,4.719
information as you can,8439.439,3.761
uh,8442.399,2.401
and try to also just develop a good,8443.2,4.08
general knowledge um,8444.8,5.2
so you at least have like,8447.28,4.64
a rough lay of the land of the the,8450.0,3.76
knowledge landscape,8451.92,4.16
um like try to learn a little bit about,8453.76,4.96
a lot of things um because you might not,8456.08,3.76
know what you're really interested how,8458.72,1.759
would you know what you're really,8459.84,2.4
interested in if you at least aren't,8460.479,3.281
like doing it,8462.24,4.48
peripheral exploration of broadly of,8463.76,4.0
of,8466.72,4.12
the knowledge landscape,8467.76,6.4
um and you talk to people from different,8470.84,5.88
walks of life and different uh,8474.16,4.64
industries and professions and skills,8476.72,4.4
and like what occupations like just try,8478.8,4.559
you know,8481.12,2.239
learn as much as possible,8483.439,3.641
man search for meaning,8487.2,3.04
isn't the whole thing a search for,8490.72,2.88
meaning,8492.08,2.56
is,8493.6,2.4
yeah what's the meaning of life and all,8494.64,2.32
you know,8496.0,2.479
but just generally like i said i would,8496.96,3.84
encourage people to read broadly,8498.479,5.681
in many different subject areas um,8500.8,5.76
and and and then try to find something,8504.16,5.68
where there's an overlap of your talents,8506.56,4.16
and,8509.84,2.639
and what you're interested in so people,8510.72,3.599
may be good at something but or they may,8512.479,2.641
have,8514.319,2.16
skill at a particular thing but they,8515.12,3.04
don't like doing it,8516.479,2.801
um,8518.16,2.8
so you want to try to find a thing where,8519.28,3.36
you ha you're,8520.96,4.16
that's a good a good uh combination of,8522.64,4.24
of your of the things that you're,8525.12,4.08
inherently good at but you also like,8526.88,3.439
doing,8529.2,2.96
um,8530.319,4.16
and um and reading is a super fast,8532.16,5.36
shortcut to to figure out which where,8534.479,5.201
are you you're both good at it you like,8537.52,4.24
doing it and it will actually have,8539.68,4.08
positive impact well you've got to learn,8541.76,5.599
about things somehow so re reading,8543.76,6.48
a broad range just really,8547.359,3.761
read it,8550.24,2.239
you know the more important one is that,8551.12,2.72
kid i i,8552.479,4.721
read through the encyclopedia uh so,8553.84,4.639
that's pretty helpful,8557.2,2.72
um,8558.479,2.801
and uh,8559.92,2.479
there's also things i didn't even know,8561.28,3.28
existed or a lot so obviously it's like,8562.399,4.401
as broad as it gets encyclopedias were,8564.56,3.919
digestible i think,8566.8,4.4
uh you know whatever 40 years ago,8568.479,4.0
um,8571.2,2.56
so,8572.479,2.401
um,8573.76,2.719
you know we read through the the,8574.88,3.36
condensed version of the encyclopedia,8576.479,4.0
britannica i'd recommend that,8578.24,4.56
um you can always like skip subjects or,8580.479,4.481
you read a few paragraphs and you know,8582.8,3.28
you're not interested just jump to the,8584.96,2.56
next one,8586.08,3.2
so read the encyclopedia we're just,8587.52,2.879
gonna,8589.28,2.72
skim through it,8590.399,3.92
um,8592.0,2.319
and um,8594.88,3.84
but you know i put a lot of stock and,8597.28,3.28
certainly have a lot of respect for,8598.72,4.639
someone who puts in an honest day's work,8600.56,5.36
uh to do useful things,8603.359,3.281
and,8605.92,2.96
and just generally to have like not a,8606.64,4.48
zero-sum mindset um,8608.88,3.2
or or,8611.12,3.04
like have more of a,8612.08,5.84
grow the pie mindset like the,8614.16,5.44
if you if you sort of say like,8617.92,4.559
when when we see people like perhaps um,8619.6,5.52
including some very smart people,8622.479,5.441
kind of uh taking an attitude of uh like,8625.12,4.4
like doing things that seem like morally,8627.92,2.88
questionable,8629.52,3.839
it's often because they have at a base,8630.8,4.96
sort of axiomatic level a zero-sum,8633.359,3.921
mindset,8635.76,4.16
um and and they without realizing it,8637.28,4.4
they don't realize they have a,8639.92,3.68
zero-sum mindset or at least that they,8641.68,3.679
don't realize it consciously,8643.6,3.839
um and so if you have a zero-sum mindset,8645.359,3.601
then the only way to get ahead is by,8647.439,3.92
taking things from others,8648.96,4.56
if if it's like if if,8651.359,4.641
if the pie is fixed then the only way to,8653.52,4.48
have more pie is to take someone else's,8656.0,3.12
pie,8658.0,3.04
but but this is false like obviously the,8659.12,3.52
pie has grown dramatically over time the,8661.04,3.439
economic pie,8662.64,3.2
so,8664.479,4.801
in reality you can have that,8665.84,3.44
so overuse this analogy if you have a,8669.439,6.241
lot of you can have there's a lot of pi,8671.76,3.92
yeah it's not fixed um,8675.76,4.8
so you really want to make sure you,8678.8,4.0
don't you're not operating um,8680.56,3.919
without realizing it from a zero-sum,8682.8,3.44
mindset,8684.479,2.96
where the only way to get ahead is to,8686.24,2.239
take things from others then that's,8687.439,2.401
going to result in you trying to take,8688.479,3.361
things from others which is not not good,8689.84,3.84
it's much better to work on,8691.84,2.12
uh,8693.68,1.36
[Music],8693.96,2.76
adding to the economic pie maybe you,8695.04,4.16
know so,8696.72,2.48
uh you know creating,8699.439,3.92
like i said creating more than you,8702.0,3.84
consume uh doing more than you,8703.359,4.241
yeah um,8705.84,3.599
so that that's a big deal um i think,8707.6,3.44
there's like you know a fair number of,8709.439,3.281
people in,8711.04,3.359
in finance that,8712.72,4.4
uh do have a bit of a zero-sum mindset,8714.399,5.04
i mean it's all walks of life i've seen,8717.12,5.44
that one of the one of the reasons,8719.439,6.0
uh rogan inspires me he celebrates oh,8722.56,5.6
there's a lot there's not not creating a,8725.439,4.321
constant competition like there's a,8728.16,3.6
scarcity of resources what happens when,8729.76,3.92
you celebrate others and you promote,8731.76,3.04
others,8733.68,2.88
the ideas of others,8734.8,4.32
it uh it actually grows that pie i mean,8736.56,5.759
it the every like the uh the resource,8739.12,5.359
the resources become less scarce,8742.319,3.841
and that that applies in a lot of kinds,8744.479,3.361
of domains it applies in academia where,8746.16,3.279
a lot of people are very,8747.84,3.68
uh see some funding for academic,8749.439,4.641
research is zero sum and it is not if,8751.52,4.56
you celebrate each other if you make if,8754.08,3.84
you get everybody to be excited about ai,8756.08,4.48
about physics above mathematics i think,8757.92,4.399
it there'd be more and more funding and,8760.56,4.0
i think everybody wins yeah that applies,8762.319,4.241
i think broadly,8764.56,4.879
yeah yeah exactly so last,8766.56,6.48
last question about love and meaning,8769.439,6.241
uh what is the role of love in the human,8773.04,4.88
condition broadly and more specific to,8775.68,5.36
you how has love romantic love or,8777.92,4.96
otherwise made you a better person a,8781.04,4.72
better human being,8782.88,2.88
better engineer,8787.04,3.439
now you're asking really perplexing,8789.04,3.04
questions,8790.479,3.92
um,8792.08,4.72
it's hard to give up,8794.399,4.08
i mean there are many,8796.8,4.559
books poems and songs written about what,8798.479,4.321
is love and,8801.359,3.441
what is what exactly,8802.8,4.88
you know um,8804.8,4.24
you know what is love people don't hurt,8807.68,3.52
me,8809.04,2.16
um that's one of the great ones yes yeah,8811.52,4.64
you've you've earlier quoted shakespeare,8814.399,5.121
but that that's really up there yeah,8816.16,5.76
let me that was the many splendor thing,8819.52,4.0
uh,8821.92,3.28
i mean there's um,8823.52,3.04
it's because we've talked about so many,8825.2,2.8
inspiring things like be useful in the,8826.56,3.839
world sort of like solve problems,8828.0,4.56
alleviate suffering but,8830.399,4.161
it seems like connection between humans,8832.56,5.12
is a source you know it's a,8834.56,4.799
it's a source of joy it's a source of,8837.68,3.6
meaning and that that's what love is,8839.359,4.641
friendship love,8841.28,4.8
i i just wonder if you think about that,8844.0,4.399
kind of thing when you talk about,8846.08,3.6
preserving the light of human,8848.399,3.04
consciousness right and thus becoming a,8849.68,5.44
multiplication multi-planetary species,8851.439,6.401
i mean to me at least,8855.12,4.48
um,8857.84,4.479
that that means like if we're just alone,8859.6,5.12
and conscious and intelligent it doesn't,8862.319,4.481
mean nearly as much as if we're with,8864.72,3.36
others,8866.8,3.44
right and there's some magic created,8868.08,3.84
when we're together,8870.24,2.8
the,8871.92,3.2
uh the friendship of it and i think the,8873.04,4.319
highest form of it is love which i think,8875.12,4.8
broadly is is much bigger than just sort,8877.359,5.361
of romantic but also yes romantic love,8879.92,3.84
and,8882.72,3.52
um family and those kinds of things well,8883.76,4.639
i mean the reason i guess i care about,8886.24,3.92
us becoming a multi-planet species in a,8888.399,3.841
space frank civilization,8890.16,2.88
is,8892.24,4.0
foundationally i love humanity,8893.04,4.96
um,8896.24,5.68
and and so i wish to see it prosper and,8898.0,7.04
do great things and be happy and,8901.92,5.439
um and if i did not love humanity i,8905.04,5.439
would not care about these things,8907.359,3.12
so when you look at the whole of it the,8911.12,3.199
the human history all the people has,8912.8,4.48
ever lived all the people alive now,8914.319,4.0
it's pretty,8917.28,4.32
we're we're okay,8918.319,5.521
on the whole we're pretty interesting,8921.6,3.6
uh bunch,8923.84,2.639
yeah,8925.2,2.88
both things considered,8926.479,3.521
and i've read a lot of history including,8928.08,4.56
the darkest worst parts of it,8930.0,5.359
and uh and despite all that i think on,8932.64,4.24
balance,8935.359,4.0
i still love humanity,8936.88,5.12
you joked about it with the 42 uh what,8939.359,3.921
what do you think is the meaning of this,8942.0,3.359
whole thing,8943.28,5.6
is like is there a non-numerical oh,8945.359,5.601
yeah well really i think what douglas,8948.88,3.439
adams was saying in hitchhiker's guide,8950.96,3.12
to the galaxy is that,8952.319,3.361
um,8954.08,3.76
the universe is the answer,8955.68,3.04
and,8957.84,2.08
uh,8958.72,2.0
what,8959.92,2.479
we really need to figure out are what,8960.72,3.84
questions to ask about the answer that,8962.399,4.161
is the universe yeah,8964.56,3.44
and that the question is the really the,8966.56,2.879
hard part and if you can properly frame,8968.0,3.439
the question then the answer relatively,8969.439,4.481
speaking is easy,8971.439,3.681
so,8973.92,4.8
so therefore if you want to understand,8975.12,4.4
what,8978.72,2.08
questions to ask about the universe you,8979.52,2.64
want to understand the meaning of life,8980.8,2.559
we need to,8982.16,2.4
expand the scope and scale of,8983.359,2.321
consciousness,8984.56,3.68
so that we're better able to,8985.68,3.92
understand the nature of the universe,8988.24,2.239
and,8989.6,2.719
and understand the meaning of life,8990.479,3.041
and ultimately,8992.319,3.281
the most important part would be to ask,8993.52,4.08
the right question,8995.6,3.52
yes uh,8997.6,3.28
thereby elevating the role of the,8999.12,3.68
interviewer,9000.88,4.24
yes exactly as the most important human,9002.8,4.8
in the room,9005.12,4.4
good questions are,9007.6,3.52
you know it's a hot it's hard to come up,9009.52,3.04
with good questions,9011.12,3.92
uh absolutely um,9012.56,4.16
but yeah like it's like that that is the,9015.04,4.48
foundation of my philosophy is that,9016.72,5.12
um i i am curious about the nature of,9019.52,4.24
the universe and,9021.84,3.68
uh,9023.76,4.639
you know and obviously i will die,9025.52,4.56
i don't know when i'll die but i won't,9028.399,4.161
live forever um,9030.08,4.0
but i would like to know that we are on,9032.56,3.44
a path to understanding the nature of,9034.08,3.44
the universe and the meaning of life and,9036.0,3.6
what questions to ask about the answer,9037.52,3.919
that is the universe,9039.6,4.0
and um and so if we expand the scope and,9041.439,4.0
scale of humanity and consciousness in,9043.6,3.6
general which includes silicon,9045.439,4.561
consciousness then,9047.2,2.8
that you know there were that that seems,9050.399,4.481
like a fundamentally good thing,9051.84,3.04
elon like i said,9055.04,4.399
i'm deeply grateful that you would spend,9057.359,3.681
your extremely valuable time with me,9059.439,4.801

difficult time this divisive time,9066.319,6.241
in this uh cynical time so i hope you do,9069.6,4.4
continue doing what you're doing thank,9072.56,2.879
