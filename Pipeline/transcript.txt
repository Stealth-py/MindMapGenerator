Text Right? Start Time 397.3 Duration 0.56
Text MCKAYLA GILBERT-LURIE:Well, respectfully, Start Time 397.86 Duration 1.25
Text Justice Friedland,we would disagree Start Time 399.11 Duration 1.5

Text CJ, in this case, hasa political affiliation Start Time 401.9 Duration 3.35
Text with the [INAUDIBLE] nation. Start Time 405.25 Duration 1.48
Text And that's because CJ is thechild of an enrolled member Start Time 406.73 Duration 3.29
Text of [INAUDIBLE] nation. Start Time 410.02 Duration 1.08
Text And it's useful tothink about membership Start Time 411.1 Duration 2.4
Text in a federally recognized tribeas analogous to citizenship. Start Time 413.5 Duration 3.86
Text And in much the same way thatthe United States government Start Time 417.36 Duration 3.04
Text grants to grant citizenship tothe children of United States Start Time 420.4 Duration 3.72
Text citizens who are born abroad,federally recognized tribes Start Time 424.12 Duration 3.54

Text AMUL THAPAR: So how-- Start Time 433.345 Duration 1.095
Text I'm sorry. Start Time 434.44 Duration 0.525
Text MICHELLE FRIEDLAND: I wasjust going to ask, how Start Time 434.965 Duration 1.245
Text do you get to another tribe? Start Time 436.21 Duration 1.68
Text Because it was actuallya different tribe Start Time 437.89 Duration 2.01
Text that expressed aninterest in this child. Start Time 439.9 Duration 2.49
Text And I have an easier timeseeing what the rationale could Start Time 442.39 Duration 3.48
Text be for helping the child becomea member of his or her parent's Start Time 445.87 Duration 3.63
Text tribe, rather thansome other tribe. Start Time 449.5 Duration 1.905
Text MCKAYLA GILBERT-LURIE:Certainly. Start Time 451.405 Duration 1.375
Text So the fact thatICWA allows children Start Time 452.78 Duration 2.51
Text to be placed withmembers of another tribe Start Time 455.29 Duration 2.13
Text speaks to Congress'sconcern when Start Time 457.42 Duration 2.58
Text they were passing ICWAin 1978, that children Start Time 460.0 Duration 3.9
Text were being removed not onlyfrom their tribes and families, Start Time 463.9 Duration 2.64
Text but from Indianculture more generally. Start Time 466.54 Duration 2.41
Text And it was this concern that-- Start Time 468.95 Duration 2.48
Text MERRICK GARLAND: Sohow is that, though, Start Time 471.43 Duration 2.37
Text political rather than racial? Start Time 473.8 Duration 2.06
Text That is, if the child has noconnection to the other tribe. Start Time 475.86 Duration 6.31
Text I understand the argumentyou're making about the tribe Start Time 482.17 Duration 3.21
Text that his father's from,but for the other tribe, Start Time 485.38 Duration 2.43
Text there is no connection. Start Time 487.81 Duration 1.95
Text Why is this political? Start Time 489.76 Duration 1.303
Text MCKAYLA GILBERT-LURIE:Well, Your Honor, Start Time 491.063 Duration 1.667
Text because CJ, or a given child,has a political affiliation Start Time 492.73 Duration 4.08
Text with a tribe, that child, thus,has a political affiliation Start Time 496.81 Duration 4.65
Text to Indian culture. Start Time 501.46 Duration 1.77
Text And Congress sought to correctthe devastating consequences, Start Time 503.23 Duration 3.36
Text and the psychologicalharm to children-- Start Time 506.59 Duration 1.83
Text MERRICK GARLAND: Isthe United States' Start Time 508.42 Duration 1.583
Text relationship with Indian tribesindividually or with anyone Start Time 510.003 Duration 4.656
Text who is an Indian? Start Time 514.659 Duration 1.681
Text That is the politicalrelationship. Start Time 516.34 Duration 1.739
Text MCKAYLA GILBERT-LURIE:Well, Your Honor, Start Time 518.079 Duration 1.667
Text it's a politicalaffiliation with both tribes Start Time 519.746 Duration 2.354
Text and with children-- or rather--with members of tribes, Start Time 522.1 Duration 3.09
Text so it's both an individualand a collective Start Time 525.19 Duration 2.13
Text political affiliation. Start Time 527.32 Duration 1.2
Text But it's not apolitical affiliation Start Time 528.52 Duration 2.25
Text with all who identifyas Indian, and that's Start Time 530.77 Duration 2.91
Text because membership in afederally recognized tribe Start Time 533.68 Duration 2.94
Text is distinct from identifying asan Indian or a Native American. Start Time 536.62 Duration 4.32
Text The two don't mapon to one another. Start Time 540.94 Duration 2.41
Text There are 5.2 million peoplein this country, at least Start Time 543.35 Duration 2.99
Text according to themost recent census, Start Time 546.34 Duration 2.37
Text that identify as AmericanIndian or Alaskan Native. Start Time 548.71 Duration 2.72
Text MICHELLE FRIEDLAND: But they'renot all of the same culture, Start Time 551.43 Duration 2.96
Text are they? Start Time 554.39 Duration 0.5
Text So you were juststarting to talk Start Time 554.89 Duration 1.41
Text about the legislativehistory, and you talk about Start Time 556.3 Duration 2.19
Text in your brief aswell that Congress Start Time 558.49 Duration 2.25
Text was trying to remedythe harms of removing Start Time 560.74 Duration 2.67
Text Indian children fromquote "Indian society", Start Time 563.41 Duration 2.95
Text but is there any suchthing as Indian society? Start Time 566.36 Duration 2.33
Text Or is that just a stereotype? Start Time 568.69 Duration 1.29
Text It seems like there aremany different tribes Start Time 569.98 Duration 2.01
Text with many different cultures. Start Time 571.99 Duration 1.703
Text MCKAYLA GILBERT-LURIE:Justice Friedland, it's true. Start Time 573.693 Duration 2.167
Text Tribes do haveindividual cultures, Start Time 575.86 Duration 2.16
Text and they are distinctpolitical entities. Start Time 578.02 Duration 2.01
Text But we would suggestthat this Court look Start Time 580.03 Duration 3.12
Text to the amicus brief filedjust this year, in the Fifth Start Time 583.15 Duration 3.69
Text Circuit the 325 tribes-- Start Time 586.84 Duration 2.79
Text federally recognized tribes--who filed an amicus brief Start Time 589.63 Duration 2.97
Text in Bracheen v Burnhardt, whoall evinced their understanding Start Time 592.6 Duration 3.6
Text that ICWA does serve to protectIndian children and tribes, Start Time 596.2 Duration 3.69
Text even with this thirdplacement, that Start Time 599.89 Duration 1.77
Text allows children tobe placed in a tribe, Start Time 601.66 Duration 2.76
Text even if it's not thetribe they were born into. Start Time 604.42 Duration 3.01
Text And that's because this thirdpreference allows for children Start Time 607.43 Duration 3.29
Text to be placed with other Indianfamilies, if, for example-- Start Time 610.72 Duration 2.485
Text AMUL THAPAR: Doesn't that-- Start Time 613.205 Duration 1.125
Text Doesn't that changeyou when you add Start Time 614.33 Duration 2.33
Text in the thirdpreference, any tribe, Start Time 616.66 Duration 2.55
Text aren't you evisceratingthe political distinction Start Time 619.21 Duration 3.27

Text MCKAYLA GILBERT-LURIE: I don'tthink so, Justice Thapar. Start Time 624.487 Duration 2.333
Text And that's becausethese children only Start Time 626.82 Duration 2.5
Text have a political affiliationwith Indian culture Start Time 629.32 Duration 2.97
Text at all because they are thechildren of members of tribes. Start Time 632.29 Duration 4.2
Text And those members havea political affiliation Start Time 636.49 Duration 2.34
Text with the tribe. Start Time 638.83 Duration 0.66

Text MCKAYLA GILBERT-LURIE:Yes, Justice Thapar. Start Time 658.128 Duration 1.792
Text This Court-- Start Time 659.92 Duration 0.67

Text of the tribal members. Start Time 665.65 Duration 1.02
Text Saying anyone with even onedrop of Asian, or Black blood, Start Time 666.67 Duration 4.47
Text can't be a member. Start Time 671.14 Duration 2.04
Text Then, would you still say itwas political in nature, and OK? Start Time 673.18 Duration 3.113
Text MCKAYLA GILBERT-LURIE: Well, twopoints on that, Justice Thapar. Start Time 676.293 Duration 2.667
Text First, yes, tribes, accordingto this Court in Santa Clara Start Time 678.96 Duration 3.16
Text Pueblo v Martinez,are authorized Start Time 682.12 Duration 2.46
Text to have complete authority todefine their own membership. Start Time 684.58 Duration 2.64
Text But the second point isthat Congress need not Start Time 687.22 Duration 2.46
Text recognize all of these tribes. Start Time 689.68 Duration 1.8
Text So if a tribe did define itsmembership in a way that was Start Time 691.48 Duration 3.66
Text anathema to Congress'sunderstanding of what a tribe Start Time 695.14 Duration 2.528
Text should be-- or at leastwhat the government Start Time 697.668 Duration 1.792

Text AMUL THAPAR: But ifCongress recognized them, Start Time 700.975 Duration 1.875
Text you'd say that then,we would have to allow Start Time 702.85 Duration 2.49
Text racially discriminatory tribes? Start Time 705.34 Duration 1.357
Text MCKAYLA GILBERT-LURIE:No, Your Honor, Start Time 706.697 Duration 1.583

Text impermissible commandeeringof the state's, Start Time 1477.14 Duration 2.07

Text And then the Court asks whetherthat statute is best read Start Time 1489.15 Duration 2.72

Text agencies who are regulated? Start Time 1509.51 Duration 1.923
Text AL KELLEY: Both, Your Honor. Start Time 1511.433 Duration 1.167
Text So ICWA is best referred asregulating private actors Start Time 1512.6 Duration 3.42
Text for two primary reasons. Start Time 1516.02 Duration 1.54
Text The first is that itserves to confer rights Start Time 1517.56 Duration 3.35
Text on private actors, Indianchildren, parents, and tribes Start Time 1520.91 Duration 3.39
Text involved in these proceedings. Start Time 1524.3 Duration 1.87
Text And the second isthat the statute Start Time 1526.17 Duration 1.49
Text is of general application. Start Time 1527.66 Duration 1.59
Text So it applies withequal force to Start Time 1529.25 Duration 2.49
Text both public and private actors. Start Time 1531.74 Duration 1.74
Text So states involved inthese proceedings, as well Start Time 1533.48 Duration 2.52
Text as individuals, such as theCaldwell's, and perhaps, Start Time 1536.0 Duration 3.195
Text private adoption or foster. Start Time 1539.195 Duration 1.125
Text AMUL THAPAR: What aboutwhen it requires states Start Time 1540.32 Duration 1.958
Text to keep records and the like? Start Time 1542.278 Duration 2.482
Text Isn't it requiring statesto affirmatively do Start Time 1544.76 Duration 3.84
Text certain things? Start Time 1548.6 Duration 1.26
Text AL KELLEY: So the recordkeeping requirement Start Time 1549.86 Duration 2.13
Text is best read as securingone of the rights Start Time 1551.99 Duration 2.85
Text that ICWA conferson private actors. Start Time 1554.84 Duration 2.08
Text And that's the rightconferred in Section 1917, Start Time 1556.92 Duration 3.02
Text for an adoptedIndian child to learn Start Time 1559.94 Duration 3.0
Text of their tribal affiliationthrough Court records. Start Time 1562.94 Duration 2.73
Text And the only way forthis right to be secured Start Time 1565.67 Duration 2.37
Text is by requiring thatstate courts maintain Start Time 1568.04 Duration 2.46
Text records in Section 1951. Start Time 1570.5 Duration 2.37
Text So that's still best read asregulating private actors, Start Time 1572.87 Duration 2.94
Text because it servesto confer a right. Start Time 1575.81 Duration 2.25

Text understood as rightsthat are secured Start Time 1610.19 Duration 1.98

Text ICWA doesn't requirestate legislatures Start Time 1870.68 Duration 2.13

Text MICHELLE FRIEDLAND: I know youargue that, in that regard, Start Time 1894.663 Duration 2.417

Text AL KELLEY: That may bethe case, Your Honor. Start Time 1920.27 Duration 1.833
Text However, it's very similarto what this court faced Start Time 1922.103 Duration 2.247
Text in Reno v Condon,in which Congress Start Time 1924.35 Duration 2.55
Text passed a law regulatingthe use of information Start Time 1926.9 Duration 3.27
Text created by state DMVs. Start Time 1930.17 Duration 2.19

Text applied not just to state DMVs,but to the private parties who Start Time 1935.87 Duration 3.66

Text And so there, thestatute clearly Start Time 1942.32 Duration 2.4
Text have an outsizedeffect on states. Start Time 1944.72 Duration 2.08
Text But the court stillheld that, because it Start Time 1946.8 Duration 2.0
Text was of generalapplication it didn't Start Time 1948.8 Duration 2.13
Text violate theanti-commandeering doctrine Start Time 1950.93 Duration 2.25

Text an unconditionalorder to state actors, Start Time 1963.95 Duration 3.26
Text ICWA is better understood asa limitation on state action. Start Time 1967.21 Duration 4.06
Text So the Brady HandgunAct Provision Start Time 1971.27 Duration 2.49
Text that was at issue in Princeordered state officers Start Time 1973.76 Duration 2.88
Text to conduct backgroundchecks irrespective Start Time 1976.64 Duration 2.25
Text of any other state action. Start Time 1978.89 Duration 1.58

Text from their biologicalparents or place that child Start Time 1986.33 Duration 2.85

Text be compelled to complywith obligations Start Time 1998.81 Duration 3.21

Text of the Constitution becauseit represents an omission Start Time 2192.61 Duration 2.76

Text Is that a racial classification? Start Time 2565.61 Duration 1.53

Text And the Ninth Circuit hashelpfully defined this for us, Start Time 2636.1 Duration 2.8

Text MERRICK GARLAND: TheNinth Circuit actually Start Time 2641.3 Duration 1.792
Text doesn't carry much sway here. Start Time 2643.092 Duration 2.288
Text And Mancari only talked about-- Start Time 2648.53 Duration 2.46
Text no disrespect to the NinthCircuit, but it is the fact. Start Time 2650.99 Duration 3.225
Text Mancari talked abouttribal self-government Start Time 2657.05 Duration 2.26

Text Did we suggest thatthat was the only Start Time 2662.96 Duration 2.21
Text possible ground forrecognizing this Start Time 2665.17 Duration 4.17
Text as a political circumstance? Start Time 2669.34 Duration 2.28
Text The example that my colleagueon the left expresses Start Time 2671.62 Duration 3.3
Text is close to tribal government. Start Time 2674.92 Duration 2.0

Text we see that tribalself-governance Start Time 2688.3 Duration 1.62
Text has been construed narrowly. Start Time 2689.92 Duration 1.65
Text So we can fast forward, forexample, to Rice in 2000 where Start Time 2691.57 Duration 3.09
Text this court held that thecandidate qualification Start Time 2694.66 Duration 2.64
Text preference for native Hawaiianswho had an ancestor who Start Time 2697.3 Duration 4.63

Text of a federally recognizedtribe, that preference Start Time 2709.45 Duration 2.4
Text would still fail Mancari. Start Time 2711.85 Duration 1.86
Text Because it went tocritical state affairs. Start Time 2713.71 Duration 2.22
Text Even though the Office ofHawaiian Affairs in many ways Start Time 2715.93 Duration 3.15
Text functioned similar to parts ofthe Bureau of Indian Affairs. Start Time 2719.08 Duration 3.25

Text if we look at this court'sprecedent following Mancari. Start Time 2724.15 Duration 2.305
Text MICHELLE FRIEDLAND : Butin both of those cases, Start Time 2726.455 Duration 2.165
Text there was some tribal ornative-related entity. Start Time 2728.62 Duration 4.29

Text long-held understandingof where there Start Time 2750.38 Duration 2.16
Text is a political classification. Start Time 2752.54 Duration 1.69
Text So to turn to some examples. Start Time 2754.23 Duration 1.74
Text We see in cases likeFisher and Angelo, Start Time 2755.97 Duration 2.72
Text those cases involved politicalclassifications not just Start Time 2758.69 Duration 4.92

Text MELANIE FONTS: Yes,Your Honor, it's Start Time 2907.38 Duration 1.5
Text still a racial classificationunder that circumstance Start Time 2908.88 Duration 2.49
Text for three reasons. Start Time 2911.37 Duration 2.08
Text First, even though a law mayclassify other individuals Start Time 2913.45 Duration 4.16
Text excluding or outsidethat racial group, Start Time 2917.61 Duration 2.61
Text the law is not any lessof a racial classification Start Time 2920.22 Duration 2.85
Text where race is thepredominant factor. Start Time 2923.07 Duration 1.805
Text And we can see this inother equal protection cases Start Time 2924.875 Duration 2.125
Text for example, inMiller v Johnson. Start Time 2927.0 Duration 2.19
Text Second, This court has held thatthe political classification Start Time 2929.19 Duration 5.43
Text is narrowed to members offederally recognized tribes. Start Time 2934.62 Duration 2.94
Text Because it recognizesthat there is an official Start Time 2937.56 Duration 2.07
Text process for thatfederal recognition. Start Time 2939.63 Duration 2.052
Text For example, if we look atthe Federal Acknowledgment Start Time 2941.682 Duration 2.208
Text Act, which has governedthe federal recognition Start Time 2943.89 Duration 2.91
Text process since 1994,part of that act Start Time 2946.8 Duration 3.12
Text requires that tribes submitconstitutions and bylaws Start Time 2949.92 Duration 3.63
Text defining their membership. Start Time 2953.55 Duration 1.65
Text So federal recognitionis predicated Start Time 2955.2 Duration 2.1
Text on an understandingof how the tribe will Start Time 2957.3 Duration 2.13
Text define its membership. Start Time 2959.43 Duration 1.75
