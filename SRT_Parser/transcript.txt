Text When we are in a stationary car that moves rapidly to gain speed, Start Time 4.54 Duration 3.9
Text we get pushed back against our seat. Start Time 8.68 Duration 2.02
Text And when brakes are applied, we get pushed ahead. Start Time 11.0 Duration 3.48
Text Or when we take a sharp right turn, we are pushed towards the left. Start Time 14.76 Duration 3.78
Text These are all situations where we are Accelerating! Start Time 18.74 Duration 3.74
Text We have all experienced this whether in a car, Start Time 22.6 Duration 2.68
Text or a bus, or while riding a motorbike. Start Time 25.44 Duration 2.84
Text Simply put, when velocity changes, we have acceleration. Start Time 28.64 Duration 4.78
Text I still haven't defined what acceleration is. Start Time 33.66 Duration 2.88
Text I just told you that when velocity changes, there will be acceleration. Start Time 36.72 Duration 5.32
Text Okay, let me give you two examples. Start Time 42.32 Duration 2.76
Text In the first one, Start Time 45.18 Duration 0.86
Text a car is traveling in a straight line at a constant speed of 80 kilometers an hour. Start Time 46.34 Duration 5.04
Text And in the second one, Start Time 51.48 Duration 1.16
Text a plane is traveling in a straight line at a constant speed Start Time 52.94 Duration 3.02
Text of 1,000 kilometers an hour. Start Time 55.96 Duration 2.42
Text In which case do you think Acceleration is involved? Start Time 58.68 Duration 4.36
Text None! In both cases, the velocity is not changing at all. Start Time 67.16 Duration 4.9
Text Hence, there will be no acceleration in either of the cases! Start Time 72.18 Duration 3.96
Text Most people relate acceleration to high speed ! Start Time 76.28 Duration 3.24
Text And that's clearly not true! Start Time 79.76 Duration 2.0
Text Acceleration will only exist when there is change in velocity. Start Time 82.04 Duration 4.16
Text Do you remember what velocity is ? Start Time 86.5 Duration 2.62
Text Its speed with direction and its hence of vector quantity! Start Time 89.42 Duration 4.4
Text Why is this important? Start Time 94.06 Duration 2.0
Text Let's say a body moves from rest and Start Time 96.06 Duration 1.7
Text reaches a velocity of 20 kilometers an hour in five seconds. Start Time 97.88 Duration 4.3
Text Will acceleration be involved here? Start Time 102.42 Duration 2.86
Text Yes, because the velocity is changing. It was zero initially, Start Time 105.5 Duration 4.7
Text and at the end of five seconds it's 20 kilometers per hour. Start Time 110.56 Duration 3.68
Text In another scenario, Start Time 114.5 Duration 1.47
Text assume that a body is moving at 30 kilometers an hour, Start Time 115.97 Duration 2.99
Text and then it moves right at 30 kilometers an hour Start Time 119.16 Duration 3.32
Text and continues traveling at the same speed of 30 kilometers per hour. Start Time 122.66 Duration 4.42
Text Will there be acceleration in this case? Start Time 127.3 Duration 3.28
Text The answer is yes ! Start Time 135.32 Duration 1.32
Text As the direction is changing, Start Time 136.98 Duration 1.86
Text the velocity will also change. Start Time 139.18 Duration 2.0
Text The only thing constant in this example is speed. Start Time 141.42 Duration 3.38
Text But the velocity changes as the direction changes! Start Time 145.02 Duration 3.8
Text So this was the most important concept you had to know about acceleration. Start Time 148.82 Duration 4.36
Text It will exist only when there is a change in velocity! Start Time 153.32 Duration 3.52
Text But how is acceleration calculated? Start Time 157.22 Duration 3.12
Text Acceleration is defined as the rate of change of velocity. Start Time 160.66 Duration 4.42
Text In terms of a formula, Start Time 165.42 Duration 1.36
Text Acceleration can be written as 'change in velocity' Start Time 166.84 Duration 2.72
Text 'over the time taken'. If the velocity of an object changes Start Time 169.6 Duration 4.08
Text from an initial value of U to the final value of V, in time t, then the acceleration Start Time 173.9 Duration 6.76
Text "a" can be written as 'V minus U' over t. Start Time 180.72 Duration 3.96
Text Said this object is at rest initially at point "a". Start Time 184.98 Duration 3.64
Text It then travels to the right and attains the velocity of Start Time 188.88 Duration 3.38
Text '10 meters per second' in five seconds. Start Time 192.26 Duration 2.72
Text What will be the acceleration here at point B? Start Time 195.32 Duration 3.12
Text We can look at the formula to get the answer! Start Time 198.44 Duration 3.3
Text The initial velocity U is zero meters per second as the object is stationary. Start Time 202.0 Duration 5.32
Text The final Velocity V is 10 meters per second. Start Time 207.66 Duration 2.98
Text And the time taken t is 5 seconds. Start Time 211.08 Duration 2.66
Text Hence the acceleration a will equal '10 meters per second' minus Start Time 213.98 Duration 3.98
Text 'zero meters per second', divided by 5 seconds. Start Time 218.26 Duration 3.3
Text So this will equal 10 meters per second divided by 5 seconds. Start Time 221.82 Duration 4.16
Text '10 divided by 5' is 2. Start Time 226.3 Duration 2.16
Text Wait.. hold on.. Start Time 228.72 Duration 1.92
Text What will be the units of acceleration? Start Time 230.64 Duration 2.92
Text We should get a hint by looking at this. Start Time 233.82 Duration 1.82
Text The units of acceleration will be Start Time 236.04 Duration 2.0
Text 'meters per second' per second. Start Time 238.32 Duration 2.78
Text Because it's the change in velocity over the time taken! Start Time 241.36 Duration 3.68
Text As this is meters per second, Start Time 245.3 Duration 2.0
Text we can carry this second to the denominator Start Time 247.3 Duration 2.16
Text and what we will get is 'meters per second squared.' Start Time 249.46 Duration 3.74
Text This one is more intuitive, but this one is a bit neater I would say. Start Time 253.48 Duration 4.48
Text So the acceleration in this case will be '2 meters per second squared'. Start Time 258.22 Duration 5.32
Text And acceleration is also a vector quantity! Start Time 263.54 Duration 2.8
Text Here, Start Time 266.66 Duration 1.02
Text Acceleration and Velocity are in the same direction! Start Time 267.68 Duration 3.88
Text There are many more important concepts Start Time 271.98 Duration 1.54
Text about acceleration, which we will cover in the coming videos. Start Time 273.6 Duration 4.3
