Text like a systematic process you've spoken Start Time 1088.24 Duration 3.84
Text about first principles thinking but is Start Time 1090.48 Duration 6.24
Text there kind of a process to it well um Start Time 1092.08 Duration 4.64
Text you know like saying like like physics Start Time 1097.12 Duration 2.72
Text is law and everything else is a Start Time 1098.64 Duration 2.64
Text recommendation Start Time 1099.84 Duration 2.8
Text um like i've met a lot of people who can Start Time 1101.28 Duration 3.279

Text just make sure you're not Start Time 1113.679 Duration 3.36
Text violating Start Time 1115.6 Duration 4.56
Text physics um Start Time 1117.039 Duration 3.121
Text and you know uh Start Time 1120.84 Duration 4.199
Text first principles analysis i think is Start Time 1123.6 Duration 3.439
Text something that can be applied to Start Time 1125.039 Duration 4.401
Text really any walk of life uh any anything Start Time 1127.039 Duration 3.921
Text really it's just it's it's really just Start Time 1129.44 Duration 3.2
Text saying um Start Time 1130.96 Duration 3.599
Text you know let's let's well something down Start Time 1132.64 Duration 4.0
Text to the most fundamental Start Time 1134.559 Duration 3.041
Text uh Start Time 1136.64 Duration 2.96
Text principles the things that we are most Start Time 1137.6 Duration 3.84
Text confident are true at a foundational Start Time 1139.6 Duration 2.72
Text level Start Time 1141.44 Duration 2.4
Text and that sets you at your sets your Start Time 1142.32 Duration 3.599
Text axiomatic base and then you reason up Start Time 1143.84 Duration 4.56
Text from there and then you cross-check your Start Time 1145.919 Duration 4.801
Text conclusion against the the axiomatic Start Time 1148.4 Duration 4.0
Text truths Start Time 1150.72 Duration 2.88
Text um Start Time 1152.4 Duration 3.12
Text so Start Time 1153.6 Duration 4.079
Text um you know some basics in physics would Start Time 1155.52 Duration 3.519
Text be like are you violating conservation Start Time 1157.679 Duration 3.041
Text of energy or momentum or something like Start Time 1159.039 Duration 3.76
Text that you know then Start Time 1160.72 Duration 3.76
Text it's not gonna work Start Time 1162.799 Duration 2.88
Text um Start Time 1164.48 Duration 3.04
Text so Start Time 1165.679 Duration 3.36
Text uh that's Start Time 1167.52 Duration 3.36
Text you know so that's just to establish is Start Time 1169.039 Duration 3.841
Text it is it possible Start Time 1170.88 Duration 3.919
Text and then another good physics tool is Start Time 1172.88 Duration 3.679
Text thinking about things in the limit if Start Time 1174.799 Duration 3.601
Text you if you take a particular thing and Start Time 1176.559 Duration 2.881
Text you Start Time 1178.4 Duration 1.84
Text uh Start Time 1179.44 Duration 2.4
Text scale it to a very large number or to a Start Time 1180.24 Duration 3.84
Text very small number how does how do things Start Time 1181.84 Duration 3.36
Text change Start Time 1184.08 Duration 3.52
Text um well it's like tempo like in number Start Time 1185.2 Duration 4.0
Text of things you manufacture something like Start Time 1187.6 Duration 3.92
Text that and then in time Start Time 1189.2 Duration 4.24
Text yeah like let's say say the example of Start Time 1191.52 Duration 3.44
Text like um Start Time 1193.44 Duration 3.28
Text like manufacturing which i think is just Start Time 1194.96 Duration 3.36
Text a very underrated Start Time 1196.72 Duration 3.6
Text problem um Start Time 1198.32 Duration 3.76
Text and and Start Time 1200.32 Duration 6.32
Text uh likes it it's it's much harder to Start Time 1202.08 Duration 5.599
Text take Start Time 1206.64 Duration 3.039
Text an advanced technology product and bring Start Time 1207.679 Duration 3.521
Text it into volume manufacturing than it is Start Time 1209.679 Duration 3.601
Text to design it in the first place my Start Time 1211.2 Duration 4.479
Text orders magnitude so Start Time 1213.28 Duration 3.2
Text um Start Time 1215.679 Duration 2.081
Text so let's say you're trying to figure out Start Time 1216.48 Duration 2.88
Text is Start Time 1217.76 Duration 3.039
Text like why is this Start Time 1219.36 Duration 2.48
Text this uh Start Time 1220.799 Duration 2.321
Text part or product Start Time 1221.84 Duration 3.76
Text expensive is it um Start Time 1223.12 Duration 3.84
Text because of something fundamentally Start Time 1225.6 Duration 2.88
Text foolish that we're doing or is it Start Time 1226.96 Duration 4.48
Text because our volume is too low and so Start Time 1228.48 Duration 3.92
Text then you say okay well what if our Start Time 1231.44 Duration 2.88
Text volume was a million units a year is it Start Time 1232.4 Duration 3.68
Text still expensive that's what i'm Start Time 1234.32 Duration 2.88
Text radically thinking about things to the Start Time 1236.08 Duration 2.88
Text limit if it's still expensive at a Start Time 1237.2 Duration 3.52
Text million units a year then volume is not Start Time 1238.96 Duration 3.36
Text the reason why your thing is expensive Start Time 1240.72 Duration 2.56
Text there's something fundamental about Start Time 1242.32 Duration 2.239
Text design Start Time 1243.28 Duration 3.04
Text and then you then can focus on the Start Time 1244.559 Duration 3.201
Text reducing complexity or something like Start Time 1246.32 Duration 3.599
Text that and change the design to change Start Time 1247.76 Duration 5.279
Text changes apart to be something that is uh Start Time 1249.919 Duration 4.24
Text uh Start Time 1253.039 Duration 3.201
Text not fundamentally expensive Start Time 1254.159 Duration 4.241
Text but like that's a common thing in Start Time 1256.24 Duration 4.4
Text rocketry because the the unit volume is Start Time 1258.4 Duration 4.72
Text relatively low and so a common excuse Start Time 1260.64 Duration 4.32
Text would be well it's expensive because our Start Time 1263.12 Duration 4.08
Text unit volume is low um and if we were in Start Time 1264.96 Duration 3.599
Text like automotive or something like that Start Time 1267.2 Duration 3.12
Text or consumer electronics then our costs Start Time 1268.559 Duration 3.281
Text would be lower and like i'm like okay so Start Time 1270.32 Duration 3.359
Text let's say we skip now you're making a Start Time 1271.84 Duration 3.12
Text million units a year is it still Start Time 1273.679 Duration 3.841
Text expensive if the answer is yes Start Time 1274.96 Duration 3.44
Text then Start Time 1277.52 Duration 2.159
Text uh Start Time 1278.4 Duration 3.519
Text economies of scale are not the issue Start Time 1279.679 Duration 3.441
Text do you throw Start Time 1281.919 Duration 2.64
Text into manufacturing do you throw like Start Time 1283.12 Duration 4.0
Text supply chain you talk about resources Start Time 1284.559 Duration 3.921
Text and materials and stuff like that do you Start Time 1287.12 Duration 2.799
Text throw that into the calculation of Start Time 1288.48 Duration 3.12
Text trying to reason from first principles Start Time 1289.919 Duration 2.961
Text like how we're going to make the supply Start Time 1291.6 Duration 2.88
Text chain work here Start Time 1292.88 Duration 3.919
Text yeah yeah and then the cost of materials Start Time 1294.48 Duration 4.319
Text things like that or is that too much Start Time 1296.799 Duration 4.641
Text exactly so um like another like a good Start Time 1298.799 Duration 4.321
Text example of thinking about things uh in Start Time 1301.44 Duration 3.84
Text the limit is Start Time 1303.12 Duration 5.76
Text um if you take any uh Start Time 1305.28 Duration 5.68
Text you know any any Start Time 1308.88 Duration 5.279
Text product any machine or whatever um Start Time 1310.96 Duration 4.959
Text like take a rocket or whatever Start Time 1314.159 Duration 2.681
Text and Start Time 1315.919 Duration 4.321
Text say uh if you've got if you look at the Start Time 1316.84 Duration 4.199
Text room Start Time 1320.24 Duration 2.48
Text raw materials in the rocket Start Time 1321.039 Duration 4.721
Text um so you're gonna have like uh Start Time 1322.72 Duration 6.319
Text aluminum steel titanium inconel Start Time 1325.76 Duration 6.72
Text especially specialty alloys um Start Time 1329.039 Duration 6.561
Text copper and and you say what are the Start Time 1332.48 Duration 4.079
Text how Start Time 1335.6 Duration 2.24
Text what what's the weight of the Start Time 1336.559 Duration 3.281
Text constituent elements of each of these Start Time 1337.84 Duration 3.52
Text elements and what is their raw material Start Time 1339.84 Duration 2.64
Text value Start Time 1341.36 Duration 3.04
Text and that sets the Start Time 1342.48 Duration 5.439
Text asymptotic limit for how Start Time 1344.4 Duration 4.96
Text low the cost of the vehicle can be Start Time 1347.919 Duration 3.76
Text unless you change the materials Start Time 1349.36 Duration 3.28
Text so Start Time 1351.679 Duration 2.721
Text and then when you do that i call it like Start Time 1352.64 Duration 3.36
Text maybe the magic wand number or something Start Time 1354.4 Duration 3.44
Text like that so that would be like if you Start Time 1356.0 Duration 3.12
Text had the Start Time 1357.84 Duration 4.079
Text you know a like just a pile of these raw Start Time 1359.12 Duration 4.08
Text materials here and you could wave magic Start Time 1361.919 Duration 2.801
Text wand and rearrange the atoms into the Start Time 1363.2 Duration 2.8
Text final shape Start Time 1364.72 Duration 2.24
Text um Start Time 1366.0 Duration 2.24
Text that would be the Start Time 1366.96 Duration 3.36
Text lowest possible cost that you could make Start Time 1368.24 Duration 3.2
Text this thing for unless you change the Start Time 1370.32 Duration 2.239
Text materials Start Time 1371.44 Duration 3.2
Text so then and that is always a you're Start Time 1372.559 Duration 4.161
Text almost always a very low number Start Time 1374.64 Duration 2.96
Text um Start Time 1376.72 Duration 3.52
Text so then the what's actually causing Start Time 1377.6 Duration 4.319
Text these to be expensive is how you put the Start Time 1380.24 Duration 5.52
Text atoms into the desired shape Start Time 1381.919 Duration 3.841
Text yeah actually if you don't mind me Start Time 1385.84 Duration 4.48
Text taking a tiny tangent i had uh i often Start Time 1387.36 Duration 5.12
Text talked to jim keller who was somebody Start Time 1390.32 Duration 3.359
Text that worked with you oh yeah that's a Start Time 1392.48 Duration 2.8
Text fantastic job jim was Start Time 1393.679 Duration 4.0
Text yeah did great work at tesla Start Time 1395.28 Duration 3.2
Text so Start Time 1397.679 Duration 2.88
Text um i suppose he carries the flame of the Start Time 1398.48 Duration 4.96
Text same kind of thinking that you're you're Start Time 1400.559 Duration 4.801
Text talking about now Start Time 1403.44 Duration 4.64
Text um and i guess i see that same thing at Start Time 1405.36 Duration 4.08
Text tesla Start Time 1408.08 Duration 3.76
Text and spacex folks who work there they Start Time 1409.44 Duration 4.32
Text kind of learn this way of thinking and Start Time 1411.84 Duration 4.719
Text it kind of becomes obvious almost Start Time 1413.76 Duration 5.2
Text but anyway i had um argument not Start Time 1416.559 Duration 3.841
Text argument Start Time 1418.96 Duration 3.68
Text uh he educated me Start Time 1420.4 Duration 3.279
Text about Start Time 1422.64 Duration 2.88
Text how cheap it might be to manufacture Start Time 1423.679 Duration 4.401
Text teslabot we just we had an argument what Start Time 1425.52 Duration 4.88
Text is how can you reduce the cost of scale Start Time 1428.08 Duration 2.959
Text of Start Time 1430.4 Duration 2.96
Text producing a robot because i've gotten a Start Time 1431.039 Duration 4.801
Text chance to interact quite a bit um Start Time 1433.36 Duration 4.48
Text obviously in in the academic circles Start Time 1435.84 Duration 4.319
Text with humanoid robots and then boston Start Time 1437.84 Duration 4.48
Text dynamics and stuff like that and they're Start Time 1440.159 Duration 4.241
Text very expensive to to build Start Time 1442.32 Duration 4.64
Text and then uh jim kind of schooled me on Start Time 1444.4 Duration 4.8
Text saying like okay like this kind of first Start Time 1446.96 Duration 3.76
Text principle is thinking of how can we get Start Time 1449.2 Duration 3.839
Text the cost of manufacturing down Start Time 1450.72 Duration 5.28
Text um i suppose you do that you have done Start Time 1453.039 Duration 4.561
Text that kind of thinking for teslabot and Start Time 1456.0 Duration 4.0
Text for all kinds of Start Time 1457.6 Duration 4.4
Text all kinds of complex systems that are Start Time 1460.0 Duration 3.76
Text traditionally seen as complex and you Start Time 1462.0 Duration 3.279
Text say okay how can we simplify everything Start Time 1463.76 Duration 3.36
Text down Start Time 1465.279 Duration 3.041
Text yeah Start Time 1467.12 Duration 3.12
Text i mean i think if you are really good at Start Time 1468.32 Duration 3.92
Text manufacturing Start Time 1470.24 Duration 3.919
Text you can basically Start Time 1472.24 Duration 3.52
Text make at high volume you can basically Start Time 1474.159 Duration 4.241
Text make anything for a cost Start Time 1475.76 Duration 5.36
Text that asymptotically approaches the real Start Time 1478.4 Duration 4.399
Text raw material value of the constituents Start Time 1481.12 Duration 3.52
Text plus any intellectual property that you Start Time 1482.799 Duration 3.601
Text need to license Start Time 1484.64 Duration 4.639
Text anything right Start Time 1486.4 Duration 4.48
Text but it's hard it's not like that's a Start Time 1489.279 Duration 3.76
Text very hard thing to do but but it is Start Time 1490.88 Duration 3.679
Text possible for anything Start Time 1493.039 Duration 3.841
Text anything in volume can be made Start Time 1494.559 Duration 4.48
Text like i said for a class Start Time 1496.88 Duration 3.679
Text that asymptotically approaches raw Start Time 1499.039 Duration 3.601
Text material uh constituents Start Time 1500.559 Duration 3.521
Text plus intellectual property license Start Time 1502.64 Duration 2.639
Text rights Start Time 1504.08 Duration 3.44
Text so what will often happen in trying to Start Time 1505.279 Duration 4.0
Text design a product is people will start Start Time 1507.52 Duration 4.8
Text with the tools and and parts and methods Start Time 1509.279 Duration 5.121
Text that they are familiar with Start Time 1512.32 Duration 3.2
Text and then Start Time 1514.4 Duration 3.519
Text and try to create a product using their Start Time 1515.52 Duration 5.519
Text existing tools and methods Start Time 1517.919 Duration 5.601
Text the other way to think about it is Start Time 1521.039 Duration 4.561
Text actually imagine the try to imagine the Start Time 1523.52 Duration 5.36
Text platonic ideal of the perfect product or Start Time 1525.6 Duration 5.679
Text technology whatever it might be Start Time 1528.88 Duration 4.88
Text and so what is this what is the perfect Start Time 1531.279 Duration 4.241
Text arrangement of atoms Start Time 1533.76 Duration 3.279
Text that would be the the best possible Start Time 1535.52 Duration 2.88
Text product Start Time 1537.039 Duration 2.88
Text and now let us try to figure out how to Start Time 1538.4 Duration 5.32
Text get the atoms in that shape Start Time 1539.919 Duration 3.801
Text i mean it's it sounds um Start Time 1543.76 Duration 4.0
Text it's almost like a rick and morty absurd Start Time 1547.84 Duration 4.16
Text until you start to really think about it Start Time 1550.32 Duration 2.479
Text and Start Time 1552.0 Duration 2.72
Text you really should Start Time 1552.799 Duration 3.921
Text think about it in this way because Start Time 1554.72 Duration 4.16
Text everything else is kind of uh Start Time 1556.72 Duration 4.319
Text if you if you think uh Start Time 1558.88 Duration 3.52
Text you you might fall victim to the Start Time 1561.039 Duration 2.801
Text momentum of the way things are done in Start Time 1562.4 Duration 3.44
Text the past unless you think in this way Start Time 1563.84 Duration 3.76
Text well just as a function of inertia Start Time 1565.84 Duration 3.04
Text people will Start Time 1567.6 Duration 2.88
Text want to use the same tools and methods Start Time 1568.88 Duration 3.12
Text that they are familiar with Start Time 1570.48 Duration 2.64
Text um Start Time 1572.0 Duration 2.559
Text they just that's what they'll do by Start Time 1573.12 Duration 4.24
Text default yeah and then that will lead to Start Time 1574.559 Duration 4.561
Text an outcome of things that can be made Start Time 1577.36 Duration 3.6
Text with those tools and methods but it is Start Time 1579.12 Duration 3.84
Text unlikely to be the Start Time 1580.96 Duration 4.16
Text platonic idea of the perfect product Start Time 1582.96 Duration 2.959
Text um Start Time 1585.12 Duration 1.76
Text so Start Time 1585.919 Duration 3.041
Text then so that's why it's good to think of Start Time 1586.88 Duration 3.279
Text things in both directions they're like Start Time 1588.96 Duration 2.4
Text what can we build with the tools that we Start Time 1590.159 Duration 4.241
Text have but then but but also what is the Start Time 1591.36 Duration 4.799
Text what is the perfect the theoretical Start Time 1594.4 Duration 3.92
Text perfect product look like and that that Start Time 1596.159 Duration 3.601
Text theoretical perfect part is going to be Start Time 1598.32 Duration 3.44
Text a moving target because as you learn Start Time 1599.76 Duration 2.799
Text more Start Time 1601.76 Duration 3.919
Text the definition of or or for that perfect Start Time 1602.559 Duration 4.641
Text product will change because you don't Start Time 1605.679 Duration 2.801
Text actually know what the perfect product Start Time 1607.2 Duration 3.64
Text is but you can successfully approximate Start Time 1608.48 Duration 5.679
Text a more perfect product Start Time 1610.84 Duration 5.48
Text so the thing about it like that and then Start Time 1614.159 Duration 4.561
Text saying okay now what tools methods Start Time 1616.32 Duration 5.2
Text materials whatever do we need to Start Time 1618.72 Duration 6.12
Text create in order to get the atoms in that Start Time 1621.52 Duration 6.32
Text shape but for people Start Time 1624.84 Duration 5.079
Text rarely think about it that way Start Time 1627.84 Duration 4.64
Text but it's a powerful tool Start Time 1629.919 Duration 4.961
Text i should mention that the brilliant Start Time 1632.48 Duration 4.559
Text siobhan zillis is hanging on Start Time 1634.88 Duration 3.76
Text hanging out with us Start Time 1637.039 Duration 3.76
Text in case you hear a voice of uh wisdom Start Time 1638.64 Duration 3.2
Text from uh Start Time 1640.799 Duration 4.801
Text from from outside from up above Start Time 1641.84 Duration 6.319
Text okay so let me ask you about mars you Start Time 1645.6 Duration 4.72
Text mentioned it would be great for science Start Time 1648.159 Duration 3.601
Text to put Start Time 1650.32 Duration 3.52
Text um a base on the moon to do some Start Time 1651.76 Duration 3.12
Text research Start Time 1653.84 Duration 2.559
Text but Start Time 1654.88 Duration 4.0
Text the truly big leap again in this Start Time 1656.399 Duration 4.561
Text category of seemingly impossible is to Start Time 1658.88 Duration 4.799
Text put a human being on mars Start Time 1660.96 Duration 4.48
Text when do you think spacex will land a Start Time 1663.679 Duration 5.48
Text human being on mars Start Time 1665.44 Duration 3.719
Text hmm Start Time 1670.24 Duration 3.0
Text best case is about five years Start Time 1688.64 Duration 6.2
Text worst case tenures Start Time 1691.2 Duration 3.64
Text what are the determining factors would Start Time 1696.799 Duration 4.24
Text you say from an engineering perspective Start Time 1698.559 Duration 5.281
Text or is that that not the bottlenecks Start Time 1701.039 Duration 5.841
Text uh you know it's fundamentally um Start Time 1703.84 Duration 8.0
Text you know engineering the the vehicle um Start Time 1706.88 Duration 4.96
Text i mean starship is the most Start Time 1712.24 Duration 4.559

Text something like that it's a lot Start Time 1720.24 Duration 4.88
Text it's really next level so Start Time 1721.919 Duration 4.321
Text um Start Time 1725.12 Duration 3.52
Text and the fundamental optimization of Start Time 1726.24 Duration 4.48
Text starship is minimizing cost per ton to Start Time 1728.64 Duration 4.159
Text orbit and ultimately cost per ton to the Start Time 1730.72 Duration 3.679
Text surface of mars Start Time 1732.799 Duration 3.041
Text um this may seem like a mercantile Start Time 1734.399 Duration 3.041
Text objective but it is actually the thing Start Time 1735.84 Duration 4.0
Text that needs to be optimized Start Time 1737.44 Duration 4.56
Text um like there is a certain Start Time 1739.84 Duration 4.16
Text cost per tonne to the surface of mars Start Time 1742.0 Duration 4.08
Text where we can afford to establish a Start Time 1744.0 Duration 4.24
Text self-sustaining uh city Start Time 1746.08 Duration 3.44
Text um and Start Time 1748.24 Duration 2.88
Text and then above that we cannot afford to Start Time 1749.52 Duration 4.96
Text do it um so right right now you couldn't Start Time 1751.12 Duration 4.96
Text fly to mars for a trillion dollars Start Time 1754.48 Duration 3.199
Text doesn't no amount of money could get Start Time 1756.08 Duration 3.04
Text your ticket to mars Start Time 1757.679 Duration 4.081
Text so we need to get that above Start Time 1759.12 Duration 4.4
Text uh you know to get that like something Start Time 1761.76 Duration 5.039
Text that is actually possible at all um Start Time 1763.52 Duration 4.08
Text um Start Time 1766.799 Duration 3.12

Text to a lot of people but Start Time 1790.64 Duration 2.8
Text uh Start Time 1792.159 Duration 4.0
Text like eventually given enough time Start Time 1793.44 Duration 3.68

Text uh Start Time 1803.919 Duration 2.721
Text something that humans do to themselves Start Time 1804.72 Duration 3.76

Text um Start Time 1809.76 Duration 2.24
Text and Start Time 1811.039 Duration 4.081
Text um but a bit of you know eventually Start Time 1812.0 Duration 5.84
Text and if nothing if none of that happens Start Time 1815.12 Duration 6.0
Text and somehow magically we keep going Start Time 1817.84 Duration 5.439
Text then the sun will the sun is gradually Start Time 1821.12 Duration 3.36
Text expanding Start Time 1823.279 Duration 4.161
Text um and will engulf the earth um and Start Time 1824.48 Duration 5.76
Text probably earth gets too hot for Start Time 1827.44 Duration 4.719
Text uh life in Start Time 1830.24 Duration 3.2
Text uh Start Time 1832.159 Duration 3.12
Text about 500 million years it's a long time Start Time 1833.44 Duration 2.959
Text but that's only Start Time 1835.279 Duration 3.921
Text 10 longer than earth has been around Start Time 1836.399 Duration 5.681
Text and so if you think about like the Start Time 1839.2 Duration 4.24
Text because the current situation is really Start Time 1842.08 Duration 3.12
Text remarkable um and kind of hard to Start Time 1843.44 Duration 4.0
Text believe but Start Time 1845.2 Duration 2.959
Text uh Start Time 1847.44 Duration 2.08
Text it's been around four and a half billion Start Time 1848.159 Duration 3.361

Text possible to extend life beyond earth Start Time 1852.64 Duration 5.36
Text and that window opportunity may be open Start Time 1855.6 Duration 4.16
Text for a long time and i hope it is but it Start Time 1858.0 Duration 3.84
Text also may be open for a short time and we Start Time 1859.76 Duration 4.639
Text should uh i think it was Start Time 1861.84 Duration 4.559
Text wise for us to Start Time 1864.399 Duration 4.0
Text uh Start Time 1866.399 Duration 4.481
Text act quickly while the window is open Start Time 1868.399 Duration 5.201

Text um Start Time 1887.2 Duration 3.68
Text could die with a bang or a whimper Start Time 1888.72 Duration 4.079
Text you know if it's uh Start Time 1890.88 Duration 4.159
Text if it dies a demographic collapse then Start Time 1892.799 Duration 3.76
Text it's more of a whimper Start Time 1895.039 Duration 2.88
Text obviously Start Time 1896.559 Duration 2.881
Text but if it's world war three it's more of Start Time 1897.919 Duration 2.64
Text a bang Start Time 1899.44 Duration 3.04
Text but but these are all risks Start Time 1900.559 Duration 3.521
Text um i mean it's important to think of Start Time 1902.48 Duration 2.799
Text these things and just Start Time 1904.08 Duration 2.16
Text you know think of things as like Start Time 1905.279 Duration 3.28
Text probabilities not certainties um there's Start Time 1906.24 Duration 4.559
Text a certain probability that Start Time 1908.559 Duration 4.561
Text something bad will happen on earth like Start Time 1910.799 Duration 4.161
Text i think most likely the future will be Start Time 1913.12 Duration 3.2
Text good um Start Time 1914.96 Duration 2.559
Text but there's like let's say for Start Time 1916.32 Duration 4.0
Text argument's sake um a one percent chance Start Time 1917.519 Duration 4.481
Text per century of Start Time 1920.32 Duration 3.44
Text of a civilization ending event like that Start Time 1922.0 Duration 4.32
Text was stephen hawking's estimate Start Time 1923.76 Duration 3.759
Text um Start Time 1926.32 Duration 2.8
Text i think he's he might be right about Start Time 1927.519 Duration 2.481
Text that Start Time 1929.12 Duration 2.76
Text uh so Start Time 1930.0 Duration 5.2
Text then uh Start Time 1931.88 Duration 5.48
Text you know we should basically Start Time 1935.2 Duration 3.68
Text think of this like being a multi-planet Start Time 1937.36 Duration 3.12
Text species just like taking out insurance Start Time 1938.88 Duration 3.76

Text life Start Time 1942.64 Duration 4.08
Text [Laughter] Start Time 1943.06 Duration 5.739
Text so it's turned into an infomercial real Start Time 1946.72 Duration 4.24
Text quick life insurance for life yes Start Time 1948.799 Duration 5.201
Text um and you know we we can bring the the Start Time 1950.96 Duration 5.28
Text the creatures from uh you know plants Start Time 1954.0 Duration 4.0
Text and animals from earth to mars and Start Time 1956.24 Duration 4.799

Text and and have a second planet with with Start Time 1961.039 Duration 3.36
Text life um Start Time 1963.039 Duration 3.36
Text that would be great um they can't bring Start Time 1964.399 Duration 4.0
Text themselves there you know so if we don't Start Time 1966.399 Duration 3.361
Text bring them to mars Start Time 1968.399 Duration 2.801
Text then they will just Start Time 1969.76 Duration 3.84
Text for sure all die when the sun expands Start Time 1971.2 Duration 5.04
Text anyway and then that'll be it what do Start Time 1973.6 Duration 4.799
Text you think is the most difficult aspect Start Time 1976.24 Duration 4.559
Text of building a civilization on mars Start Time 1978.399 Duration 4.64

Text get a large number of folks there Start Time 1990.0 Duration 5.44
Text who will never return back to earth Start Time 1992.88 Duration 4.24
Text uh no they could certainly return some Start Time 1995.44 Duration 3.28
Text will return back to earth they will Start Time 1997.12 Duration 3.2
Text choose to stay there for the rest of Start Time 1998.72 Duration 4.88
Text their lives yeah many will um Start Time 2000.32 Duration 6.8
Text but uh we you know we Start Time 2003.6 Duration 4.959
Text we need the spaceships back like the Start Time 2007.12 Duration 3.2
Text ones that go to mars read them back so Start Time 2008.559 Duration 3.6
Text you can hop on if you want you know it's Start Time 2010.32 Duration 3.52
Text like but we can't just not have the Start Time 2012.159 Duration 3.12
Text spaceships come back those things are Start Time 2013.84 Duration 3.52
Text expensive we need them i'd like to come Start Time 2015.279 Duration 3.681
Text back and do another trip i mean do you Start Time 2017.36 Duration 3.439
Text think about the terraforming aspect like Start Time 2018.96 Duration 3.36
Text actually building are you so focused Start Time 2020.799 Duration 3.841
Text right now on the spaceships part that's Start Time 2022.32 Duration 4.479
Text so critical yeah tomorrow Start Time 2024.64 Duration 3.44
Text we absolutely if you can't get there Start Time 2026.799 Duration 2.72

Text of mars right now Start Time 2060.48 Duration 3.28

Text self-sustaining civilization Start Time 2067.52 Duration 3.04
Text um Start Time 2069.52 Duration 4.559

Text at least a factor of a thousand Start Time 2074.079 Duration 4.241
Text a million per ton Start Time 2076.72 Duration 3.52
Text yes ideally less than much less than a Start Time 2078.32 Duration 4.079
Text million ton but if it's not Start Time 2080.24 Duration 3.839
Text like it's got to be Start Time 2082.399 Duration 4.401
Text say if i say like what well how much can Start Time 2084.079 Duration 4.56
Text society affords to spend or want to just Start Time 2086.8 Duration 4.16

Text and it's only a matter of time you know Start Time 2123.68 Duration 2.48
Text you're going to die Start Time 2124.88 Duration 4.0

Text this you could say like i don't know Start Time 2146.079 Duration 4.721
Text it's probably at least a million tons Start Time 2148.4 Duration 3.439
Text um Start Time 2150.8 Duration 2.16
Text because you have to set up a lot of Start Time 2151.839 Duration 3.361

Text like i said you can't be missing any Start Time 2155.2 Duration 4.639

Text uh Start Time 2230.16 Duration 4.64
Text there is like Start Time 2232.079 Duration 4.961
Text like Start Time 2234.8 Duration 2.24
Text there are some ideas about Start Time 2237.599 Duration 6.24
Text having space like so so Start Time 2240.079 Duration 3.76
Text you can only move at the speed of light Start Time 2245.04 Duration 3.52
Text through through space but Start Time 2246.4 Duration 5.04
Text if you can make space itself move Start Time 2248.56 Duration 4.88
Text that that's like that that's Start Time 2251.44 Duration 3.84
Text warping space Start Time 2253.44 Duration 4.48
Text um space is is capable of moving faster Start Time 2255.28 Duration 4.16

Text right Start Time 2259.44 Duration 2.56
Text uh like the universe in the big bang the Start Time 2260.32 Duration 3.759

Text much more than the speed of light Start Time 2264.079 Duration 4.76
Text by a lot yeah um Start Time 2265.839 Duration 5.841
Text so um Start Time 2268.839 Duration 5.561
Text but the Start Time 2271.68 Duration 2.72
Text if this is possible the the amount of Start Time 2275.119 Duration 5.281
Text energy required towards space is so Start Time 2276.96 Duration 6.0
Text gigantic it's boggles the mind Start Time 2280.4 Duration 3.92

Text propulsion how much innovation is Start Time 2284.32 Duration 4.16
Text possible with rocket propulsion is this Start Time 2285.92 Duration 3.6
Text um Start Time 2288.48 Duration 2.96
Text i mean you've seen it all and you're Start Time 2289.52 Duration 4.8
Text constantly innovating in every aspect Start Time 2291.44 Duration 4.56
Text how much is possible like how much can Start Time 2294.32 Duration 3.68

Text all those kinds of things Start Time 2302.56 Duration 3.76
Text well as i'm saying like the Start Time 2304.48 Duration 4.96
Text really the holy grail is a fully and Start Time 2306.32 Duration 6.64
Text rapidly reusable orbital system um Start Time 2309.44 Duration 4.639
Text so Start Time 2312.96 Duration 3.36
Text uh right now uh Start Time 2314.079 Duration 3.201
Text the Start Time 2316.32 Duration 4.08
Text falcon 9 is the only reusable rocket out Start Time 2317.28 Duration 5.12

Text the the booster comes back and lands and Start Time 2322.4 Duration 4.0
Text you've seen the videos and we get the Start Time 2324.48 Duration 3.52
Text nose cone or faring back but we do not Start Time 2326.4 Duration 3.28
Text get the upper stage back Start Time 2328.0 Duration 3.44
Text so Start Time 2329.68 Duration 2.8
Text uh Start Time 2331.44 Duration 2.72
Text that means that we have a minimum cost Start Time 2332.48 Duration 2.879

Text um and we get big airplane back but not Start Time 2343.04 Duration 3.68
Text the smaller airplane and so it still Start Time 2344.72 Duration 4.56
Text costs a lot you know so that upper stage Start Time 2346.72 Duration 3.44
Text is Start Time 2349.28 Duration 2.96
Text you know at least 10 million dollars Start Time 2350.16 Duration 3.04
Text um Start Time 2352.24 Duration 2.4
Text and then the Start Time 2353.2 Duration 3.44
Text degree of the the booster is not as Start Time 2354.64 Duration 3.52
Text reused it's not as rapidly and Start Time 2356.64 Duration 2.959
Text completely reusable as we'd like in Start Time 2358.16 Duration 3.6
Text order of the fairings so Start Time 2359.599 Duration 3.76
Text you know our kind of Start Time 2361.76 Duration 3.76

Text 15 Start Time 2369.44 Duration 3.44
Text to 20 million dollars maybe Start Time 2370.88 Duration 4.32
Text um so Start Time 2372.88 Duration 4.959
Text uh that's that's extremely good for Start Time 2375.2 Duration 4.159
Text it's by far better than any rocket ever Start Time 2377.839 Duration 3.681
Text in history um Start Time 2379.359 Duration 3.281
Text but Start Time 2381.52 Duration 1.92
Text uh Start Time 2382.64 Duration 4.0

Text reduce the cost per ton to orbit by Start Time 2386.64 Duration 6.24
Text uh a factor of a hundred Start Time 2390.0 Duration 5.119
Text but just think of it like um Start Time 2392.88 Duration 3.76
Text like imagine if you had an aircraft or Start Time 2395.119 Duration 4.081
Text something or a car Start Time 2396.64 Duration 5.12
Text oh yeah and if you had to Start Time 2399.2 Duration 4.8

Text it'll be silly frankly Start Time 2406.56 Duration 2.279
Text but Start Time 2408.16 Duration 3.199
Text um but you in fact you just refuel the Start Time 2408.839 Duration 4.52

Text and that's uh makes your trip Start Time 2413.359 Duration 4.96
Text like Start Time 2417.119 Duration 3.121
Text i don't know a thousand times cheaper Start Time 2418.319 Duration 3.441
Text so Start Time 2420.24 Duration 4.32
Text it's the same for rockets uh if you Start Time 2421.76 Duration 3.76
Text it's Start Time 2424.56 Duration 2.24
Text very difficult to make this complex Start Time 2425.52 Duration 3.04
Text machine that can go to orbit Start Time 2426.8 Duration 4.08
Text and so if you cannot reuse it and if you Start Time 2428.56 Duration 4.32
Text have to throw even any part of any Start Time 2430.88 Duration 3.6
Text significant part of it away that Start Time 2432.88 Duration 3.959
Text massively increases the cost Start Time 2434.48 Duration 4.32
Text so Start Time 2436.839 Duration 4.841
Text you know starship in theory could do Start Time 2438.8 Duration 5.44
Text a cost per launch of like a million Start Time 2441.68 Duration 3.919
Text maybe two million dollars or something Start Time 2444.24 Duration 2.48

Text like it's uh by far the biggest bang for Start Time 2456.319 Duration 4.241
Text the buck is to make it fully reusable Start Time 2458.24 Duration 4.64

Text removing rules and regulations Start Time 2740.319 Duration 3.441
Text um Start Time 2742.319 Duration 2.481

Text there should be i when you first said Start Time 2766.8 Duration 3.44
Text the the the metaphor of garbage Start Time 2768.56 Duration 3.759
Text collection from a coding standpoint from Start Time 2770.24 Duration 4.079
Text the colony standpoint yeah yeah i it Start Time 2772.319 Duration 3.601
Text would be interesting interesting if the Start Time 2774.319 Duration 4.241
Text laws themselves kind of had a built-in Start Time 2775.92 Duration 4.32
Text thing where they kind of die after a Start Time 2778.56 Duration 3.44
Text while unless somebody explicitly Start Time 2780.24 Duration 3.599
Text publicly defends them yeah so that Start Time 2782.0 Duration 3.44
Text that's sort of it's not like somebody Start Time 2783.839 Duration 3.0
Text has to kill them they kind of die Start Time 2785.44 Duration 4.48
Text themselves they disappear yeah Start Time 2786.839 Duration 5.401

Text yeah so yeah something's good something Start Time 2799.839 Duration 3.76
Text needs to happen Start Time 2802.24 Duration 3.599
Text or or just the the civilization's Start Time 2803.599 Duration 4.881
Text arteries arteries just harden over time Start Time 2805.839 Duration 4.641
Text and and you can just get less and less Start Time 2808.48 Duration 3.92
Text done because there's just a rule against Start Time 2810.48 Duration 4.32
Text everything Start Time 2812.4 Duration 2.4
Text so yeah i think like i don't know for Start Time 2814.839 Duration 4.361
Text mars order i'd say or even for you Start Time 2817.2 Duration 3.36
Text obviously for earth as well like i think Start Time 2819.2 Duration 3.44
Text there should be an active process for Start Time 2820.56 Duration 3.36
Text removing Start Time 2822.64 Duration 2.719
Text rules and regulations and questioning Start Time 2823.92 Duration 3.04
Text their existence Start Time 2825.359 Duration 3.281
Text just um Start Time 2826.96 Duration 3.359
Text like if we've got a function for Start Time 2828.64 Duration 2.88
Text creating rules and regulations because Start Time 2830.319 Duration 2.641
Text rules and regulations can also think of Start Time 2831.52 Duration 3.68
Text as like they're like software or lines Start Time 2832.96 Duration 4.08
Text of code for operating Start Time 2835.2 Duration 4.08
Text uh civilization that's the rules and Start Time 2837.04 Duration 4.0
Text regulations um Start Time 2839.28 Duration 3.12
Text so it's like we shouldn't have rules and Start Time 2841.04 Duration 2.88
Text regulations but you have code Start Time 2842.4 Duration 4.56
Text accumulation but no code removal Start Time 2843.92 Duration 4.8
Text um and so it just gets Start Time 2846.96 Duration 4.399
Text to become basically archaic bloatware Start Time 2848.72 Duration 4.16
Text after a while Start Time 2851.359 Duration 4.161
Text um and and it's just it makes it hard Start Time 2852.88 Duration 3.52
Text for Start Time 2855.52 Duration 2.24
Text things to progress Start Time 2856.4 Duration 2.24
Text so Start Time 2857.76 Duration 2.4
Text i don't know maybe mars you'd have like Start Time 2858.64 Duration 2.959
Text an uh Start Time 2860.16 Duration 2.72
Text you know any given law must have a Start Time 2861.599 Duration 4.401
Text sunset you know and and and uh and Start Time 2862.88 Duration 4.88
Text require active Start Time 2866.0 Duration 3.599

Text ultimately we'll be up to the people on Start Time 2878.319 Duration 3.601
Text mars to decide but Start Time 2879.68 Duration 4.399
Text i think um Start Time 2881.92 Duration 4.8
Text it should be easier to remove a law than Start Time 2884.079 Duration 4.721
Text to add one because of the just to Start Time 2886.72 Duration 3.92
Text overcome the inertia of laws Start Time 2888.8 Duration 2.799
Text so Start Time 2890.64 Duration 3.6
Text maybe it's like uh Start Time 2891.599 Duration 4.801
Text for argument's sake you need like say 60 Start Time 2894.24 Duration 5.359
Text percent vote to have a law take effect Start Time 2896.4 Duration 6.8
Text but only a 40 vote to remove it Start Time 2899.599 Duration 6.161

Text do you think technologically speaking Start Time 2921.68 Duration 3.919

Text light minutes away Start Time 3045.839 Duration 4.081
Text uh maybe a little more um Start Time 3047.2 Duration 4.24
Text so you can't really have something Start Time 3049.92 Duration 3.76

Text and Start Time 3324.88 Duration 4.479
Text um and then what what what system Start Time 3325.839 Duration 6.161
Text uh it is what what Start Time 3329.359 Duration 5.121
Text in what form should that that Start Time 3332.0 Duration 4.799
Text database or data system Start Time 3334.48 Duration 4.4
Text what what what would be most effective Start Time 3336.799 Duration 2.881
Text now Start Time 3338.88 Duration 2.4
Text there's a there is a fundamental issue Start Time 3339.68 Duration 5.919
Text with um say bitcoin in its current form Start Time 3341.28 Duration 6.559
Text uh in that it's the transaction volume Start Time 3345.599 Duration 3.76
Text is very limited Start Time 3347.839 Duration 2.801
Text um Start Time 3349.359 Duration 3.44
Text and uh the Start Time 3350.64 Duration 5.679

Text properly confirmed transaction is to is Start Time 3356.319 Duration 3.76
Text too long much longer than you'd like Start Time 3358.0 Duration 4.72
Text so it's not it's actually not great from Start Time 3360.079 Duration 3.441
Text um Start Time 3362.72 Duration 2.639
Text a transaction volume standpoint or a Start Time 3363.52 Duration 3.52
Text latency standpoint Start Time 3365.359 Duration 3.361
Text um Start Time 3367.04 Duration 4.96
Text uh so it is perhaps useful as Start Time 3368.72 Duration 5.839

Text it's all it seems to be all kind of a Start Time 3398.16 Duration 4.159
Text trade-off but the point is it's kind of Start Time 3400.079 Duration 3.76
Text brilliant to say that just think about Start Time 3402.319 Duration 3.28
Text information think about what kind of Start Time 3403.839 Duration 3.201

Text um Start Time 3439.599 Duration 2.96
Text and and then something that allows you Start Time 3440.48 Duration 2.8
Text to Start Time 3442.559 Duration 3.441
Text uh shift obligations across time like Start Time 3443.28 Duration 4.799

Text across time then what does what does the Start Time 3448.079 Duration 3.681
Text best job of that Start Time 3450.319 Duration 2.8
Text um Start Time 3451.76 Duration 3.52
Text part reason why i think there's some Start Time 3453.119 Duration 4.881
Text um merit to dogecoin even though it was Start Time 3455.28 Duration 5.839
Text obviously created as a joke um Start Time 3458.0 Duration 4.48
Text is that Start Time 3461.119 Duration 4.24
Text it it actually does have a much higher Start Time 3462.48 Duration 5.04
Text uh transaction volume capability than Start Time 3465.359 Duration 4.401
Text bitcoin um Start Time 3467.52 Duration 4.319
Text and the you know the cut like the costs Start Time 3469.76 Duration 4.64
Text of doing a transaction the the dogecoin Start Time 3471.839 Duration 4.72
Text fee is is very low like right now if you Start Time 3474.4 Duration 4.159
Text want to do a bitcoin transaction the Start Time 3476.559 Duration 3.52
Text price of doing that transaction is very Start Time 3478.559 Duration 4.0
Text high so you could not use it effectively Start Time 3480.079 Duration 4.161
Text for most things Start Time 3482.559 Duration 3.681
Text um and nor could it even scale to a high Start Time 3484.24 Duration 4.96
Text volume um Start Time 3486.24 Duration 5.28
Text uh Start Time 3489.2 Duration 2.32
Text and when bitcoin was you know started i Start Time 3491.68 Duration 4.0
Text guess when around 2008 or something like Start Time 3493.92 Duration 3.36
Text that um Start Time 3495.68 Duration 4.32
Text the internet connections were much worse Start Time 3497.28 Duration 3.92
Text than they are today like order of Start Time 3500.0 Duration 3.04
Text magnitude cup Start Time 3501.2 Duration 4.399
Text i mean there's the way way worse you Start Time 3503.04 Duration 5.519
Text know in 2008 so so like having us you Start Time 3505.599 Duration 4.401
Text know a small Start Time 3508.559 Duration 4.081
Text uh block size or whatever is Start Time 3510.0 Duration 4.48
Text you know and a long Start Time 3512.64 Duration 3.919
Text synchronization time is Start Time 3514.48 Duration 5.119
Text made sense in 2008 but did you know 2021 Start Time 3516.559 Duration 6.081
Text or fast forward 10 years it's like it's Start Time 3519.599 Duration 4.641
Text it's like Start Time 3522.64 Duration 4.24
Text comically low you know it's uh Start Time 3524.24 Duration 4.599
Text so Start Time 3526.88 Duration 3.52
Text um Start Time 3528.839 Duration 2.921
Text and i think there's some Start Time 3530.4 Duration 2.56
Text value to Start Time 3531.76 Duration 2.319
Text having Start Time 3532.96 Duration 3.52
Text a linear increase in the amount of Start Time 3534.079 Duration 6.081
Text currency that uh is generated um Start Time 3536.48 Duration 5.359
Text so because some amount of the currency Start Time 3540.16 Duration 2.72
Text like like Start Time 3541.839 Duration 4.72
Text if a currency is too deflationary or Start Time 3542.88 Duration 6.0
Text like uh or should say if if Start Time 3546.559 Duration 5.121
Text if if a currency is expected to increase Start Time 3548.88 Duration 4.8
Text in value over time there's reluctance to Start Time 3551.68 Duration 3.28
Text spend it Start Time 3553.68 Duration 3.04
Text because they're like oh i if i Start Time 3554.96 Duration 3.52
Text i'll just hold it and not spend it Start Time 3556.72 Duration 3.44
Text because it's scarcity is increasing with Start Time 3558.48 Duration 4.0
Text time so if i spend it now then i will Start Time 3560.16 Duration 4.56
Text regret spending it so i will just you Start Time 3562.48 Duration 5.28
Text know total it Start Time 3564.72 Duration 3.04
Text but if there's Start Time 3567.839 Duration 2.96
Text some dilution of the currency occurring Start Time 3569.2 Duration 3.119
Text over time that's that's more of an Start Time 3570.799 Duration 4.0
Text incentive to use that as a currency so Start Time 3572.319 Duration 5.52
Text um those coins somewhat randomly has Start Time 3574.799 Duration 3.841
Text uh Start Time 3577.839 Duration 2.0
Text a Start Time 3578.64 Duration 2.479
Text um Start Time 3579.839 Duration 3.52
Text just a fixed a number of Start Time 3581.119 Duration 3.041
Text of Start Time 3583.359 Duration 4.081
Text sort of coins or hash strings that Start Time 3584.16 Duration 4.159
Text uh Start Time 3587.44 Duration 2.48
Text are generated every year so there's Start Time 3588.319 Duration 3.441
Text there's some inflation but it's not a Start Time 3589.92 Duration 4.72
Text percentage base it's a it's so the Start Time 3591.76 Duration 6.079
Text it's a fixed number so the percentage of Start Time 3594.64 Duration 4.88
Text inflation will necessarily decline over Start Time 3597.839 Duration 2.881
Text time Start Time 3599.52 Duration 3.039
Text um Start Time 3600.72 Duration 4.24
Text so it just i'm not saying that it's like Start Time 3602.559 Duration 5.121
Text the ideal system for a currency but i Start Time 3604.96 Duration 4.639
Text think it actually is uh just Start Time 3607.68 Duration 4.24
Text fundamentally better than Start Time 3609.599 Duration 5.52
Text anything else i've seen just by accident Start Time 3611.92 Duration 7.76
Text um so i like how you said um around 2008 Start Time 3615.119 Duration 6.641
Text so you're not uh Start Time 3619.68 Duration 3.84
Text you know some people suggested you might Start Time 3621.76 Duration 3.68
Text be satoshi nakamoto you previously said Start Time 3623.52 Duration 4.88
Text you're not i'm not Start Time 3625.44 Duration 2.96
Text would you tell us if you were yes okay Start Time 3628.64 Duration 4.159

Text technology that is a completely Start Time 3642.559 Duration 5.361
Text anonymous inventor Start Time 3644.88 Duration 3.04
Text or creator Start Time 3648.799 Duration 3.32
Text well i mean you can you can look at the Start Time 3663.28 Duration 3.2
Text um Start Time 3665.359 Duration 3.681
Text evolution of ideas Start Time 3666.48 Duration 6.319
Text um before the launch of bitcoin Start Time 3669.04 Duration 5.36
Text and Start Time 3672.799 Duration 4.56
Text see who wrote Start Time 3674.4 Duration 2.959
Text you know about those ideas Start Time 3677.44 Duration 4.24

Text don't know who created bitcoin for Start Time 3682.96 Duration 3.839

Text the evolution of ideas is is pretty Start Time 3686.799 Duration 4.401
Text clear before that and like it seems as Start Time 3688.96 Duration 5.119
Text though like nick zabo uh is probably Start Time 3691.2 Duration 5.04
Text more than anyone else uh responsible for Start Time 3694.079 Duration 4.961
Text the evolution of those ideas so Start Time 3696.24 Duration 4.96
Text he claims not to be Start Time 3699.04 Duration 3.84
Text nakamoto but Start Time 3701.2 Duration 3.04
Text i'm not sure that's that's neither here Start Time 3702.88 Duration 4.0
Text nor there uh but he he seems to be the Start Time 3704.24 Duration 4.4
Text one more responsible for the ideas Start Time 3706.88 Duration 3.919
Text behind bitcoin than anyone else Start Time 3708.64 Duration 4.24
Text so it's not perhaps like singular Start Time 3710.799 Duration 4.401
Text figures aren't even as important as the Start Time 3712.88 Duration 4.0
Text the figures involved in the evolution of Start Time 3715.2 Duration 4.24
Text ideas that led to a thing so yeah yeah Start Time 3716.88 Duration 5.76
Text it's you know and most perhaps it's sad Start Time 3719.44 Duration 5.52

Text a really really Start Time 4533.52 Duration 3.44
Text i mean at least in academic literature Start Time 4534.88 Duration 4.4
Text it's tracking through occlusions it's Start Time 4536.96 Duration 3.6
Text very difficult Start Time 4539.28 Duration 2.48
Text yeah we're doing it Start Time 4540.56 Duration 2.8
Text i understand this yeah Start Time 4541.76 Duration 3.36

Text they don't before they have object Start Time 4562.64 Duration 2.8
Text permanence it's like a new thing every Start Time 4564.0 Duration 3.6
Text time it's like whoa this toy went poof Start Time 4565.44 Duration 3.84
Text just faired and now it's back again and Start Time 4567.6 Duration 2.8

Text peekaboo is fresh every time Start Time 4572.32 Duration 3.76
Text [Laughter] Start Time 4573.67 Duration 4.41
Text but then we figure out object permanence Start Time 4576.08 Duration 3.68
Text then they realize oh no the object is Start Time 4578.08 Duration 3.76
Text not gone it's just behind your back Start Time 4579.76 Duration 4.479
Text um sometimes i wish we never did figure Start Time 4581.84 Duration 4.399
Text out objective permanence Start Time 4584.239 Duration 4.96
Text yeah so that's uh Start Time 4586.239 Duration 5.361
Text that's an important problem to solve Start Time 4589.199 Duration 3.761
Text yes so so Start Time 4591.6 Duration 2.559

Text now you can't remember like you have to Start Time 4605.199 Duration 2.801
Text say like how long do you want to Start Time 4606.8 Duration 3.12
Text remember things for and and it's it Start Time 4608.0 Duration 3.76
Text there's there's a cost to remembering Start Time 4609.92 Duration 3.84
Text things for a long time so you could you Start Time 4611.76 Duration 3.439
Text know like run out of Start Time 4613.76 Duration 3.28
Text memory to if you try to remember too Start Time 4615.199 Duration 3.201
Text much for too long Start Time 4617.04 Duration 3.44
Text um and and then you also have things Start Time 4618.4 Duration 4.08
Text that are stale if if they're Start Time 4620.48 Duration 3.44
Text remember them for too long and then you Start Time 4622.48 Duration 3.12
Text also need things that are Start Time 4623.92 Duration 4.64
Text remembered over time so even if you Start Time 4625.6 Duration 4.88
Text like say have like Start Time 4628.56 Duration 4.48
Text fragrance like five seconds of memory uh Start Time 4630.48 Duration 5.04
Text on a time basis but like let's say you Start Time 4633.04 Duration 4.72
Text you're parked at light and you and you Start Time 4635.52 Duration 3.76
Text saw Start Time 4637.76 Duration 3.28
Text you use a pedestrian example that people Start Time 4639.28 Duration 4.48
Text were waiting to cross the Start Time 4641.04 Duration 4.88
Text across the road and you can't you can't Start Time 4643.76 Duration 4.16
Text quite see them because of an occlusion Start Time 4645.92 Duration 2.799
Text uh Start Time 4647.92 Duration 2.799
Text but they might wait for a minute before Start Time 4648.719 Duration 3.761
Text the light changes for them to cross the Start Time 4650.719 Duration 4.161
Text road you still need to remember that Start Time 4652.48 Duration 4.32
Text that that's where they were Start Time 4654.88 Duration 3.52
Text um and that they're probably going to Start Time 4656.8 Duration 4.0
Text cross the road type of thing um so even Start Time 4658.4 Duration 4.72
Text if that exceeds your Start Time 4660.8 Duration 4.16
Text your your time-based memory should not Start Time 4663.12 Duration 3.2
Text exceed your space Start Time 4664.96 Duration 3.04
Text memory Start Time 4666.32 Duration 3.76
Text and i just think the data engine side of Start Time 4668.0 Duration 4.8
Text that so getting the data to learn all Start Time 4670.08 Duration 4.88
Text the concepts that you're saying now is Start Time 4672.8 Duration 3.68
Text an incredible process it's this Start Time 4674.96 Duration 4.0
Text iterative process of just it's this this Start Time 4676.48 Duration 6.32
Text hydrogen at many parts Start Time 4678.96 Duration 3.84
Text we're changing the name to something Start Time 4683.199 Duration 4.321
Text else okay i'm sure it would be equally Start Time 4684.8 Duration 4.96
Text as yeah rick and morty like there's a Start Time 4687.52 Duration 4.0
Text lot of Start Time 4689.76 Duration 4.72
Text we've re-architected the neural net uh Start Time 4691.52 Duration 4.8
Text the neural nets in the cars so many Start Time 4694.48 Duration 3.28
Text times it's crazy Start Time 4696.32 Duration 3.2
Text oh so every time there's a new major Start Time 4697.76 Duration 3.36
Text version you'll rename it to something Start Time 4699.52 Duration 3.12
Text more ridiculous or Start Time 4701.12 Duration 4.0
Text uh or memorable and beautiful sorry not Start Time 4702.64 Duration 5.2
Text ridiculous of course Start Time 4705.12 Duration 2.72
Text if you see the full the full like uh Start Time 4708.0 Duration 5.199
Text array of neural nets that that that are Start Time 4710.56 Duration 4.24
Text operating in the car it kind of boggles Start Time 4713.199 Duration 3.921
Text the mind there's so there's so many Start Time 4714.8 Duration 4.96
Text layers it's crazy um Start Time 4717.12 Duration 4.16
Text so Start Time 4719.76 Duration 2.399
Text yeah Start Time 4721.28 Duration 2.56
Text um but Start Time 4722.159 Duration 2.56
Text and we Start Time 4723.84 Duration 2.96
Text we started off with Start Time 4724.719 Duration 3.201
Text uh Start Time 4726.8 Duration 3.84
Text simple neural nets that were uh Start Time 4727.92 Duration 4.48
Text basically Start Time 4730.64 Duration 4.24
Text image recognition on a single frame Start Time 4732.4 Duration 4.08
Text from a single camera Start Time 4734.88 Duration 3.52
Text uh and then Start Time 4736.48 Duration 4.8
Text uh trying to knit those together with Start Time 4738.4 Duration 4.64
Text it you know it with the Start Time 4741.28 Duration 3.04
Text c Start Time 4743.04 Duration 2.48
Text i should say we Start Time 4744.32 Duration 3.2
Text we're really primarily running c here Start Time 4745.52 Duration 3.679
Text because c plus plus is Start Time 4747.52 Duration 3.04
Text too much overhead and we have our own c Start Time 4749.199 Duration 2.401
Text compiler Start Time 4750.56 Duration 3.04
Text so to get maximum performance we Start Time 4751.6 Duration 4.32
Text actually wrote rotor and c compiler and Start Time 4753.6 Duration 3.599
Text are continuing to optimize our c Start Time 4755.92 Duration 3.04
Text compiler uh for Start Time 4757.199 Duration 3.281
Text maximum efficiency in fact we've just Start Time 4758.96 Duration 2.56
Text recently Start Time 4760.48 Duration 3.84
Text uh done a new rev on a c compiler that Start Time 4761.52 Duration 4.56
Text will compile directly to our autopilot Start Time 4764.32 Duration 3.28
Text hardware so you want to compile the Start Time 4766.08 Duration 3.36
Text whole thing down and with your own Start Time 4767.6 Duration 4.88
Text compiler yeah like so efficiency here Start Time 4769.44 Duration 4.32
Text because there's all kinds of compute Start Time 4772.48 Duration 3.6
Text there's cpu gpu there's like basic types Start Time 4773.76 Duration 3.52
Text of things Start Time 4776.08 Duration 2.4
Text and you have to somehow figure out the Start Time 4777.28 Duration 2.8
Text scheduling across all those things and Start Time 4778.48 Duration 3.6
Text so you're compiling the code down yeah Start Time 4780.08 Duration 3.52
Text it does all okay Start Time 4782.08 Duration 3.599
Text this is so that's why there's a lot of Start Time 4783.6 Duration 4.16
Text people involved Start Time 4785.679 Duration 3.921
Text there's a lot of hardcore Start Time 4787.76 Duration 5.28
Text software engineering at a very sort of Start Time 4789.6 Duration 5.68
Text bare metal level uh because Start Time 4793.04 Duration 4.08
Text we're trying to do a lot of compute Start Time 4795.28 Duration 3.84
Text that's constrained to Start Time 4797.12 Duration 3.599
Text the Start Time 4799.12 Duration 3.84
Text you know our full self-driving computer Start Time 4800.719 Duration 4.561
Text so and we want to try to have the Start Time 4802.96 Duration 4.08
Text highest frames per second Start Time 4805.28 Duration 3.52
Text um possible Start Time 4807.04 Duration 2.88
Text um Start Time 4808.8 Duration 3.76
Text within a sort of very finite amount of Start Time 4809.92 Duration 4.56
Text compute um Start Time 4812.56 Duration 4.32
Text and power so Start Time 4814.48 Duration 5.6
Text um we really put a lot of effort into Start Time 4816.88 Duration 5.12
Text the efficiency of our compute Start Time 4820.08 Duration 3.52
Text um Start Time 4822.0 Duration 3.36
Text and and uh so there's actually a lot of Start Time 4823.6 Duration 3.76
Text work done by Start Time 4825.36 Duration 3.68
Text some very talented software engineers at Start Time 4827.36 Duration 3.12
Text tesla that Start Time 4829.04 Duration 4.08
Text uh at a very foundational level to Start Time 4830.48 Duration 4.8
Text improve the efficiency of compute and Start Time 4833.12 Duration 4.16
Text how we use the Start Time 4835.28 Duration 3.919
Text the trip accelerators uh which are Start Time 4837.28 Duration 4.24
Text basically um Start Time 4839.199 Duration 5.121
Text dot you know uh doing matrix math dot Start Time 4841.52 Duration 3.679
Text products Start Time 4844.32 Duration 2.8
Text like a brazilian dot products Start Time 4845.199 Duration 4.321
Text and it's like what what are neural nets Start Time 4847.12 Duration 3.44
Text it's like Start Time 4849.52 Duration 2.8
Text compute wise like 99 Start Time 4850.56 Duration 3.679
Text dot products Start Time 4852.32 Duration 3.6
Text so Start Time 4854.239 Duration 2.641
Text you know Start Time 4855.92 Duration 2.799
Text and you want to achieve as many Start Time 4856.88 Duration 3.68
Text high frame rates like video game you Start Time 4858.719 Duration 5.041
Text want yeah full resolution Start Time 4860.56 Duration 5.28
Text high frame rate high frame rate low Start Time 4863.76 Duration 3.52
Text latency Start Time 4865.84 Duration 3.28
Text um Start Time 4867.28 Duration 5.12
Text low jitter uh so Start Time 4869.12 Duration 5.92
Text um Start Time 4872.4 Duration 4.56
Text i think one of the things we're um Start Time 4875.04 Duration 5.44
Text moving towards now is no post processing Start Time 4876.96 Duration 4.96
Text of the Start Time 4880.48 Duration 4.88
Text image through the um Start Time 4881.92 Duration 6.96
Text the image signal processor so um Start Time 4885.36 Duration 5.52
Text like for what happens for Start Time 4888.88 Duration 4.48
Text cameras is that almost all cameras is Start Time 4890.88 Duration 3.92
Text they Start Time 4893.36 Duration 2.4
Text um Start Time 4894.8 Duration 2.879
Text there's a lot of post processing done in Start Time 4895.76 Duration 4.56
Text order to make pictures look pretty Start Time 4897.679 Duration 4.0
Text and so we don't care about pictures Start Time 4900.32 Duration 3.839
Text looking pretty um we we just want the Start Time 4901.679 Duration 5.281
Text data we so we're removing just raw Start Time 4904.159 Duration 4.48
Text photon counts Start Time 4906.96 Duration 3.84
Text so the system will Start Time 4908.639 Duration 3.6
Text like the Start Time 4910.8 Duration 2.96
Text image that Start Time 4912.239 Duration 3.44
Text that the computer sees is actually much Start Time 4913.76 Duration 3.52
Text more than what Start Time 4915.679 Duration 2.96
Text you see if you're represented on a Start Time 4917.28 Duration 3.52
Text camera it's got much more data Start Time 4918.639 Duration 3.841
Text and even in very low light conditions Start Time 4920.8 Duration 3.52
Text you can see that there's a small photon Start Time 4922.48 Duration 3.92
Text count difference between Start Time 4924.32 Duration 2.879
Text you know Start Time 4926.4 Duration 2.239
Text this spot here and that's about there Start Time 4927.199 Duration 3.361
Text which means that so it can see in the Start Time 4928.639 Duration 3.921
Text dark incredibly well Start Time 4930.56 Duration 3.92
Text um because it can detect these tiny Start Time 4932.56 Duration 4.4
Text differences in photon counts Start Time 4934.48 Duration 4.4
Text like much better than you'd Start Time 4936.96 Duration 3.36
Text possibly imagine Start Time 4938.88 Duration 2.56
Text um so Start Time 4940.32 Duration 3.2
Text and and then we also save Start Time 4941.44 Duration 5.92
Text uh 13 milliseconds on a latency uh Start Time 4943.52 Duration 4.96
Text so Start Time 4947.36 Duration 3.279
Text um from removing the post processing in Start Time 4948.48 Duration 5.679
Text the image yes yeah it's like um Start Time 4950.639 Duration 5.04
Text because we've got you know eight cameras Start Time 4954.159 Duration 4.721
Text and and then there's uh Start Time 4955.679 Duration 4.321
Text roughly i don't know one and a half Start Time 4958.88 Duration 2.96
Text milliseconds or so Start Time 4960.0 Duration 5.199
Text maybe 1.6 milliseconds of latency um Start Time 4961.84 Duration 5.92
Text for each camera and so Start Time 4965.199 Duration 3.52
Text like Start Time 4967.76 Duration 1.68
Text uh Start Time 4968.719 Duration 1.841
Text um Start Time 4969.44 Duration 3.759
Text going to just uh Start Time 4970.56 Duration 5.28
Text basically bypassing the image processor Start Time 4973.199 Duration 4.561
Text uh gets us back 13 milliseconds of Start Time 4975.84 Duration 4.0
Text latency which is important Start Time 4977.76 Duration 3.52
Text um Start Time 4979.84 Duration 3.2
Text and we track latency all the way from Start Time 4981.28 Duration 3.439
Text you know photon hits the Start Time 4983.04 Duration 3.36
Text the camera to Start Time 4984.719 Duration 2.96
Text you know all the steps that it's got to Start Time 4986.4 Duration 2.88
Text go through to get you know go through Start Time 4987.679 Duration 2.48
Text the Start Time 4989.28 Duration 1.919
Text um Start Time 4990.159 Duration 2.721
Text the various neural nets and the the c Start Time 4991.199 Duration 3.361
Text code and Start Time 4992.88 Duration 2.88
Text there's a little bit of c plus plus Start Time 4994.56 Duration 2.24
Text there as well Start Time 4995.76 Duration 1.84
Text um Start Time 4996.8 Duration 3.359
Text well i can maybe a lot but it the the Start Time 4997.6 Duration 4.639
Text core stuff is the heavy duty computers Start Time 5000.159 Duration 4.881
Text will see um Start Time 5002.239 Duration 4.561
Text and uh Start Time 5005.04 Duration 3.52
Text and so so we track that latency all the Start Time 5006.8 Duration 4.56
Text way to an output command to the um Start Time 5008.56 Duration 4.8
Text drive unit to accelerate Start Time 5011.36 Duration 3.359
Text the brakes just to Start Time 5013.36 Duration 3.44
Text slow down the steering you know turn Start Time 5014.719 Duration 4.081
Text left or right um Start Time 5016.8 Duration 3.68
Text so because you got to output a command Start Time 5018.8 Duration 3.04
Text that's going to go to a controller and Start Time 5020.48 Duration 2.719
Text like some of these controllers have an Start Time 5021.84 Duration 3.76
Text update frequency that's maybe 10 hertz Start Time 5023.199 Duration 3.921
Text or something like that which is slow Start Time 5025.6 Duration 2.559
Text that's like now you lose 100 Start Time 5027.12 Duration 3.039
Text milliseconds potentially Start Time 5028.159 Duration 3.201
Text so Start Time 5030.159 Duration 4.801
Text um so then we want to update the Start Time 5031.36 Duration 5.359
Text the drivers on the Start Time 5034.96 Duration 3.84
Text like steering and braking control to Start Time 5036.719 Duration 4.0
Text have um Start Time 5038.8 Duration 3.76
Text more like uh 100 hertz instead of 10 Start Time 5040.719 Duration 3.201
Text hertz and you could have 10 milliseconds Start Time 5042.56 Duration 2.72
Text latency instead of 100 milliseconds Start Time 5043.92 Duration 3.44
Text worst case latency and actually jitter Start Time 5045.28 Duration 4.08
Text is more of a challenge than than latency Start Time 5047.36 Duration 3.44
Text because latency is like you can you can Start Time 5049.36 Duration 2.879
Text you can anticipate and predict but if Start Time 5050.8 Duration 3.359
Text you're but if you've got a stack up of Start Time 5052.239 Duration 3.761
Text things going from the camera to the to Start Time 5054.159 Duration 2.961
Text the computer Start Time 5056.0 Duration 3.28
Text through then a series of other computers Start Time 5057.12 Duration 5.039
Text and finally to an actuator on the car if Start Time 5059.28 Duration 4.8
Text you have a stack up of Start Time 5062.159 Duration 2.961
Text uh Start Time 5064.08 Duration 2.88
Text of tolerances of timing tolerances then Start Time 5065.12 Duration 3.68
Text you can have quite a variable latency Start Time 5066.96 Duration 4.08
Text which is called jetter and and that Start Time 5068.8 Duration 3.439
Text makes it Start Time 5071.04 Duration 4.4
Text hard to to anticipate exactly what how Start Time 5072.239 Duration 5.121
Text you should turn the car or accelerate Start Time 5075.44 Duration 2.799
Text because Start Time 5077.36 Duration 2.44
Text you know if you got maybe Start Time 5078.239 Duration 4.321
Text 150 200 milliseconds of jitter then you Start Time 5079.8 Duration 4.68
Text could be off by you know after 0.2 Start Time 5082.56 Duration 3.679
Text seconds and this can make this could Start Time 5084.48 Duration 3.36
Text make a big difference so you have to Start Time 5086.239 Duration 3.841
Text interpolate somehow to to Start Time 5087.84 Duration 4.96
Text to uh deal with the effects of jitter so Start Time 5090.08 Duration 4.72
Text that you can make like Start Time 5092.8 Duration 4.96
Text robust controlled decisions Start Time 5094.8 Duration 4.72
Text the again you have to uh so the jitters Start Time 5097.76 Duration 4.64
Text and the sensor information or the jitter Start Time 5099.52 Duration 5.44
Text can occur at any stage in the pipeline Start Time 5102.4 Duration 4.48
Text you can if you have just if you have Start Time 5104.96 Duration 5.279
Text fixed latency you can anticipate um Start Time 5106.88 Duration 7.12
Text and and uh like say okay we know that uh Start Time 5110.239 Duration 6.241
Text our information is for argument's sake Start Time 5114.0 Duration 4.88
Text 150 milliseconds stale Start Time 5116.48 Duration 4.84
Text like so for um Start Time 5118.88 Duration 4.64
Text 145 milliseconds from Start Time 5121.32 Duration 5.319
Text photons taking camera to um Start Time 5123.52 Duration 5.92
Text where you can measure a change in the Start Time 5126.639 Duration 4.801
Text acceleration of the vehicle Start Time 5129.44 Duration 4.239
Text um Start Time 5131.44 Duration 3.04
Text so Start Time 5133.679 Duration 2.881
Text then uh then you can say okay well we're Start Time 5134.48 Duration 3.04
Text gonna Start Time 5136.56 Duration 2.8
Text and we know it's 150 milliseconds so Start Time 5137.52 Duration 3.36
Text we're going to take that into account Start Time 5139.36 Duration 3.279
Text and uh Start Time 5140.88 Duration 3.6
Text and compensate for that latency however Start Time 5142.639 Duration 4.161
Text if you've got then 150 milliseconds of Start Time 5144.48 Duration 4.56
Text latency plus 100 milliseconds of jitter Start Time 5146.8 Duration 3.76
Text that's which could be anywhere from zero Start Time 5149.04 Duration 3.52
Text to zero to 100 milliseconds on top so Start Time 5150.56 Duration 4.32
Text then your latency could be from 150 to Start Time 5152.56 Duration 3.52
Text 150 milliseconds now you got 100 Start Time 5154.88 Duration 2.24
Text milliseconds that you don't know what to Start Time 5156.08 Duration 1.84
Text do with Start Time 5157.12 Duration 4.16
Text and and that's basically random Start Time 5157.92 Duration 4.96
Text so getting rid of jitter is extremely Start Time 5161.28 Duration 2.8
Text important Start Time 5162.88 Duration 2.799
Text and that affects your control decisions Start Time 5164.08 Duration 3.2
Text and all those kinds of things Start Time 5165.679 Duration 2.96
Text okay Start Time 5167.28 Duration 2.8
Text um yeah the car is just going to Start Time 5168.639 Duration 2.801
Text fundamentally maneuver better with lower Start Time 5170.08 Duration 4.159
Text jitter um Start Time 5171.44 Duration 2.799
Text the cars will maneuver with superhuman Start Time 5174.48 Duration 3.84
Text ability and reaction time much faster Start Time 5176.159 Duration 4.08
Text than a human Start Time 5178.32 Duration 5.28
Text i mean i think over time the Start Time 5180.239 Duration 5.281
Text autopilot full self driving will be Start Time 5183.6 Duration 4.48
Text capable of maneuvers that um Start Time 5185.52 Duration 3.6
Text you know Start Time 5188.08 Duration 3.28
Text uh Start Time 5189.12 Duration 2.24
Text you know are far more than what like Start Time 5192.239 Duration 3.121
Text james bond could do in like the best Start Time 5193.92 Duration 3.2
Text movie type of thing that's exactly what Start Time 5195.36 Duration 4.319
Text i was imagining in my mind as you said Start Time 5197.12 Duration 4.64
Text um it's like an impossible maneuvers Start Time 5199.679 Duration 5.201
Text that a human couldn't do you know so Start Time 5201.76 Duration 5.76
Text well let me ask sort of uh looking back Start Time 5204.88 Duration 4.48
Text the six years looking out into the Start Time 5207.52 Duration 3.44
Text future based on your current Start Time 5209.36 Duration 3.52
Text understanding how hard do you think this Start Time 5210.96 Duration 4.48
Text is this full self-driving problem when Start Time 5212.88 Duration 5.04
Text do you think tesla will solve level four Start Time 5215.44 Duration 4.96
Text fsd Start Time 5217.92 Duration 2.48
Text i mean it's looking quite likely that it Start Time 5220.8 Duration 4.56
Text will be next year Start Time 5222.4 Duration 4.64
Text and what does the solution look like is Start Time 5225.36 Duration 3.839
Text it the current pool of fsd beta Start Time 5227.04 Duration 4.159
Text candidates Start Time 5229.199 Duration 3.761
Text they start getting greater and greater Start Time 5231.199 Duration 3.201

Text degrees of autonomy and then there's a Start Time 5234.4 Duration 2.799
Text certain Start Time 5236.239 Duration 2.96
Text level beyond which Start Time 5237.199 Duration 3.681
Text they can they can do their own they can Start Time 5239.199 Duration 3.601
Text read a book Start Time 5240.88 Duration 3.279
Text yeah so Start Time 5242.8 Duration 2.64
Text uh Start Time 5244.159 Duration 2.961
Text i mean you can see anybody who's been Start Time 5245.44 Duration 2.799
Text following the Start Time 5247.12 Duration 3.36
Text fossil driving beta closely Start Time 5248.239 Duration 4.801
Text will see that the um Start Time 5250.48 Duration 3.6
Text the Start Time 5253.04 Duration 3.119
Text rate of disengagements has been dropping Start Time 5254.08 Duration 3.2
Text rapidly Start Time 5256.159 Duration 3.281
Text so like a disengagement b where where Start Time 5257.28 Duration 4.0
Text the driver intervenes to prevent the car Start Time 5259.44 Duration 4.0
Text from doing something right uh Start Time 5261.28 Duration 3.919
Text dangerous potentially so Start Time 5263.44 Duration 4.4
Text um Start Time 5265.199 Duration 2.641
Text so the interventions Start Time 5269.52 Duration 3.84
Text you know per million miles has been Start Time 5272.0 Duration 3.679
Text dropping uh dramatically at some point Start Time 5273.36 Duration 4.24
Text the Start Time 5275.679 Duration 2.801
Text and that Start Time 5277.6 Duration 4.32
Text trend looks like it happens next year is Start Time 5278.48 Duration 4.96
Text the the the Start Time 5281.92 Duration 6.48
Text probability of an accident on fsd uh is Start Time 5283.44 Duration 6.799
Text uh less than that of the average human Start Time 5288.4 Duration 3.36
Text and then and then significantly less Start Time 5290.239 Duration 5.761
Text than that of the average human um so Start Time 5291.76 Duration 5.28
Text it certainly Start Time 5296.0 Duration 4.4
Text appears like we will get there next year Start Time 5297.04 Duration 4.639
Text um Start Time 5300.4 Duration 2.64
Text then of course Start Time 5301.679 Duration 2.881
Text that then there's going to be a case of Start Time 5303.04 Duration 2.96
Text okay we now have to prove this to Start Time 5304.56 Duration 3.36
Text regulators and prove it to you know and Start Time 5306.0 Duration 4.32
Text and we we want a standard that is not Start Time 5307.92 Duration 4.88
Text just equivalent to a human but Start Time 5310.32 Duration 3.919
Text uh much better than the average human i Start Time 5312.8 Duration 2.879
Text think it's got to be at least two or Start Time 5314.239 Duration 3.681
Text three times uh higher Start Time 5315.679 Duration 4.0
Text safety than a human so two or three Start Time 5317.92 Duration 3.52
Text times lower probability of injury than a Start Time 5319.679 Duration 2.801
Text human Start Time 5321.44 Duration 3.279
Text before before we would actually say like Start Time 5322.48 Duration 3.759
Text okay it's okay to go it's not going to Start Time 5324.719 Duration 2.401
Text be equivalent it's going to be much Start Time 5326.239 Duration 1.92
Text better Start Time 5327.12 Duration 4.079
Text so if you look uh 10 point fsd Start Time 5328.159 Duration 6.08
Text 10.6 just came out recently 10.7 is on Start Time 5331.199 Duration 4.081
Text the way Start Time 5334.239 Duration 3.361
Text maybe 11 is on the way somewhere in the Start Time 5335.28 Duration 5.12
Text future yeah um we were hoping to get 11 Start Time 5337.6 Duration 5.84
Text out this year but it's uh Start Time 5340.4 Duration 5.759
Text 11 actually has a whole bunch of uh Start Time 5343.44 Duration 4.719
Text fundamental rewrites on the neural Start Time 5346.159 Duration 4.48
Text neural net architecture Start Time 5348.159 Duration 4.161
Text and some Start Time 5350.639 Duration 3.361
Text fundamental improvements Start Time 5352.32 Duration 2.96
Text in Start Time 5354.0 Duration 3.04
Text creating vector space Start Time 5355.28 Duration 4.24
Text uh so Start Time 5357.04 Duration 5.04
Text there is a some fundamental like leap Start Time 5359.52 Duration 4.48
Text that really deserves the 11. i mean Start Time 5362.08 Duration 4.72
Text that's a pretty cool number yeah yeah Start Time 5364.0 Duration 5.04
Text uh 11 would be uh Start Time 5366.8 Duration 4.24
Text a single stack for all you know one Start Time 5369.04 Duration 4.639
Text stack to rule them all um Start Time 5371.04 Duration 5.119
Text and uh Start Time 5373.679 Duration 4.0
Text but but there's just some really Start Time 5376.159 Duration 2.721
Text fundamental Start Time 5377.679 Duration 2.721
Text uh Start Time 5378.88 Duration 4.48
Text neural net architecture changes that are Start Time 5380.4 Duration 5.92
Text that that will allow for Start Time 5383.36 Duration 5.839
Text uh much more capability but but Start Time 5386.32 Duration 4.16
Text you know at first they're gonna have Start Time 5389.199 Duration 3.761
Text issues so like we have this working on Start Time 5390.48 Duration 4.48
Text like sort of alpha software and it's Start Time 5392.96 Duration 5.279
Text it's good but it's uh Start Time 5394.96 Duration 5.52
Text it's it it's basically taking a whole Start Time 5398.239 Duration 5.361
Text bunch of c c plus code and and deleting Start Time 5400.48 Duration 4.8
Text a massive amount of c plus plus go and Start Time 5403.6 Duration 3.2
Text replacing it with the neural net and you Start Time 5405.28 Duration 3.68
Text know andre um makes this point a lot Start Time 5406.8 Duration 3.439
Text which is like neural nets like kind of Start Time 5408.96 Duration 3.12
Text eating software Start Time 5410.239 Duration 3.841
Text you know over time there's like Start Time 5412.08 Duration 3.84
Text less and less conventional software more Start Time 5414.08 Duration 3.68
Text and more neural net we're just still Start Time 5415.92 Duration 3.68
Text software but it's you know Start Time 5417.76 Duration 3.28
Text still comes out the lines of software Start Time 5419.6 Duration 2.32
Text but Start Time 5421.04 Duration 3.84
Text uh let's just more more neural net stuff Start Time 5421.92 Duration 4.239
Text uh and less Start Time 5424.88 Duration 3.12
Text uh Start Time 5426.159 Duration 5.121
Text you know heuristics basically um Start Time 5428.0 Duration 5.12
Text if you're Start Time 5431.28 Duration 4.959
Text more more more uh matrix based Start Time 5433.12 Duration 5.28
Text stuff and less uh Start Time 5436.239 Duration 6.161
Text heuristics based stuff um Start Time 5438.4 Duration 4.0
Text and um Start Time 5442.56 Duration 2.639
Text you know like like like one of the big Start Time 5446.32 Duration 5.44
Text changes will be um Start Time 5448.8 Duration 5.359
Text like right now the neural nets Start Time 5451.76 Duration 4.64
Text uh will Start Time 5454.159 Duration 3.361
Text um Start Time 5456.4 Duration 5.36
Text deliver a giant bag of points Start Time 5457.52 Duration 6.159
Text to the c plus plus or c and c plus plus Start Time 5461.76 Duration 3.919
Text code yeah um Start Time 5463.679 Duration 4.401
Text we call the giant bag of points yeah uh Start Time 5465.679 Duration 4.721
Text and it's like so you go to pixel and and Start Time 5468.08 Duration 3.44
Text and Start Time 5470.4 Duration 2.56
Text something associated with that pixel Start Time 5471.52 Duration 3.76
Text like this pixel is probably car the Start Time 5472.96 Duration 4.8
Text pixel is probably lane line Start Time 5475.28 Duration 3.84
Text then you've got to assemble this giant Start Time 5477.76 Duration 2.56
Text bag of points Start Time 5479.12 Duration 4.559
Text in the c code and turn it into Start Time 5480.32 Duration 5.76
Text vectors Start Time 5483.679 Duration 2.401
Text and it does a pretty good job of it but Start Time 5486.96 Duration 2.88
Text it's Start Time 5488.88 Duration 2.08
Text it's a Start Time 5489.84 Duration 2.16
Text it's Start Time 5490.96 Duration 3.199
Text we want to just we need another layer of Start Time 5492.0 Duration 4.8
Text neural nets on top of that to take the Start Time 5494.159 Duration 4.321
Text giant bag of points Start Time 5496.8 Duration 4.16
Text and distill that down to Start Time 5498.48 Duration 5.679
Text uh vector space in the neural net part Start Time 5500.96 Duration 4.88
Text of the software as opposed to the Start Time 5504.159 Duration 2.801
Text heuristics Start Time 5505.84 Duration 2.72
Text part of the software Start Time 5506.96 Duration 3.44
Text this is a big improvement Start Time 5508.56 Duration 3.84
Text um you know that's all the way down it's Start Time 5510.4 Duration 3.839
Text what you want it's not even your only Start Time 5512.4 Duration 4.64
Text realness but it's it's it's uh this will Start Time 5514.239 Duration 5.361
Text be just a ga this is a game changer to Start Time 5517.04 Duration 4.8
Text not have the bag of points the giant bag Start Time 5519.6 Duration 4.8
Text of points that has to be assembled with Start Time 5521.84 Duration 5.92
Text um many lines of cfc plus plus uh and Start Time 5524.4 Duration 4.799
Text and have the Start Time 5527.76 Duration 3.2
Text and have a neural net just assemble Start Time 5529.199 Duration 4.161
Text those into a vector so so that the Start Time 5530.96 Duration 5.04
Text neural net is outputting Start Time 5533.36 Duration 4.4
Text um Start Time 5536.0 Duration 3.679
Text much much less data it's it's it's Start Time 5537.76 Duration 4.24
Text outputting this this is a lane line this Start Time 5539.679 Duration 4.0
Text is a curve this is drivable space this Start Time 5542.0 Duration 5.199
Text is a card this is a you know a Start Time 5543.679 Duration 5.04
Text pedestrian or a cyclist or something Start Time 5547.199 Duration 3.361
Text like that it's outputting Start Time 5548.719 Duration 3.281
Text um Start Time 5550.56 Duration 3.52
Text it's really outputting Start Time 5552.0 Duration 4.32
Text um profit vectors to Start Time 5554.08 Duration 3.28
Text the Start Time 5556.32 Duration 3.52
Text the cc plus less control control code as Start Time 5557.36 Duration 4.64
Text opposed to Start Time 5559.84 Duration 4.399
Text this sort of Start Time 5562.0 Duration 4.8
Text constructing the the vectors Start Time 5564.239 Duration 4.641
Text uh in c Start Time 5566.8 Duration 3.439
Text um Start Time 5568.88 Duration 2.72
Text which we've done i think quite a good Start Time 5570.239 Duration 4.4
Text job of but it's it's a it you're kind of Start Time 5571.6 Duration 5.2
Text hitting a local maximum on the how well Start Time 5574.639 Duration 3.761
Text the c can do this Start Time 5576.8 Duration 2.72
Text um Start Time 5578.4 Duration 3.2
Text so this is this is really this is really Start Time 5579.52 Duration 3.28
Text a big deal Start Time 5581.6 Duration 2.72
Text and and just all of the networks in the Start Time 5582.8 Duration 3.76
Text car need need to move to surround video Start Time 5584.32 Duration 4.0
Text there's still some legacy networks that Start Time 5586.56 Duration 5.36
Text are not surround video Start Time 5588.32 Duration 5.6
Text and all of the training needs to move to Start Time 5591.92 Duration 4.0
Text surround video and the efficiency of the Start Time 5593.92 Duration 3.84
Text training uh it needs to get better and Start Time 5595.92 Duration 2.88
Text it is Start Time 5597.76 Duration 3.08
Text and then we need to move everything to Start Time 5598.8 Duration 4.08
Text uh raw Start Time 5600.84 Duration 4.12
Text uh photon Start Time 5602.88 Duration 4.48
Text counts as opposed to um Start Time 5604.96 Duration 4.8
Text processed images okay so which is just Start Time 5607.36 Duration 3.92
Text quite a big reset on the training Start Time 5609.76 Duration 3.68
Text because the system's trained on post Start Time 5611.28 Duration 4.24
Text processed image images so we need to Start Time 5613.44 Duration 3.84
Text redo all the training Start Time 5615.52 Duration 2.719
Text uh Start Time 5617.28 Duration 3.52
Text to train against the the Start Time 5618.239 Duration 4.161
Text raw photon accounts instead of the Start Time 5620.8 Duration 4.16
Text post-processed image so ultimately it's Start Time 5622.4 Duration 4.08
Text kind of reducing the complexity of the Start Time 5624.96 Duration 4.719
Text whole thing so uh reducing reducing Start Time 5626.48 Duration 5.36
Text lines of code will actually go lower Start Time 5629.679 Duration 3.921
Text yeah that's fascinating Start Time 5631.84 Duration 3.68
Text um so you're doing fusion of all the Start Time 5633.6 Duration 3.52
Text sensors so reducing the complexity of Start Time 5635.52 Duration 4.0
Text having to deal with these cameras Start Time 5637.12 Duration 5.519
Text cameras really right yes Start Time 5639.52 Duration 3.119
Text um same with humans Start Time 5642.84 Duration 4.68
Text yeah well i guess we got years too okay Start Time 5645.28 Duration 3.359
Text yeah well we'll actually need to Start Time 5647.52 Duration 3.76
Text incorporate um sound as well um because Start Time 5648.639 Duration 4.881
Text you know you need to like listen for Start Time 5651.28 Duration 4.48
Text ambulance sirens or you know fire trucks Start Time 5653.52 Duration 4.159
Text you know uh Start Time 5655.76 Duration 3.6
Text somebody like Start Time 5657.679 Duration 2.881
Text you know yelling at you or something i Start Time 5659.36 Duration 2.56
Text don't know just that there's there's a Start Time 5660.56 Duration 2.8
Text little bit of audio that needs to be Start Time 5661.92 Duration 3.04
Text incorporated as well do you need a Start Time 5663.36 Duration 3.279
Text cookie bath break yeah we listen to the Start Time 5664.96 Duration 3.759
Text trolls take a break okay Start Time 5666.639 Duration 4.321
Text honestly frankly Start Time 5668.719 Duration 4.721
Text like the ideas are the easy thing and Start Time 5670.96 Duration 3.92
Text the implementation is the hard thing Start Time 5673.44 Duration 3.36
Text like the idea of going to the moon is is Start Time 5674.88 Duration 3.6
Text the easy part but going to the moon is Start Time 5676.8 Duration 3.76
Text the hard part it's the hard part um and Start Time 5678.48 Duration 3.679
Text there's a lot of like hardcore Start Time 5680.56 Duration 3.84
Text engineering that's got to get done Start Time 5682.159 Duration 4.56
Text at the hardware and software level uh Start Time 5684.4 Duration 5.92
Text likes it optimizing the c compiler and Start Time 5686.719 Duration 5.841
Text just you know uh Start Time 5690.32 Duration 4.16
Text cutting out latency Start Time 5692.56 Duration 3.2
Text everywhere Start Time 5694.48 Duration 2.56
Text like this is Start Time 5695.76 Duration 2.8
Text if we don't do this the system will not Start Time 5697.04 Duration 4.079
Text work properly um so Start Time 5698.56 Duration 4.32
Text the work of the engineers doing this Start Time 5701.119 Duration 4.401
Text they are like the unsung heroes you know Start Time 5702.88 Duration 4.72
Text but they are critical to the success of Start Time 5705.52 Duration 3.44
Text the situation Start Time 5707.6 Duration 2.72
Text i think you made it clear i mean at Start Time 5708.96 Duration 2.56
Text least to me it's super exciting Start Time 5710.32 Duration 3.04
Text everything that's going on outside of Start Time 5711.52 Duration 3.44
Text what andre is doing Start Time 5713.36 Duration 2.879
Text yeah just the whole infrastructure of Start Time 5714.96 Duration 2.8
Text the software Start Time 5716.239 Duration 2.96
Text i mean everything is going on with data Start Time 5717.76 Duration 3.919
Text engine uh whatever whatever it's called Start Time 5719.199 Duration 5.44
Text the whole process is just Start Time 5721.679 Duration 5.121
Text the scale of it is boggle's mind like Start Time 5724.639 Duration 3.841
Text the training the amount of work done Start Time 5726.8 Duration 3.359
Text with like we've written all this custom Start Time 5728.48 Duration 4.48
Text software for training and labeling Start Time 5730.159 Duration 4.801
Text um and to do order labeling auto Start Time 5732.96 Duration 3.759
Text leveling is essential Start Time 5734.96 Duration 3.199
Text um Start Time 5736.719 Duration 2.641
Text because especially when you've got like Start Time 5738.159 Duration 2.801
Text surround video Start Time 5739.36 Duration 4.4
Text it's very difficult to like label Start Time 5740.96 Duration 4.64
Text surround video from scratch is extremely Start Time 5743.76 Duration 4.32
Text difficult um Start Time 5745.6 Duration 3.84
Text like take a human Start Time 5748.08 Duration 3.2
Text such a long time to even label one video Start Time 5749.44 Duration 4.16
Text clip like several hours Start Time 5751.28 Duration 4.48
Text or the order label it Start Time 5753.6 Duration 4.24
Text basically would just apply like heavy Start Time 5755.76 Duration 3.28
Text duty Start Time 5757.84 Duration 2.56
Text uh Start Time 5759.04 Duration 3.119
Text like a lot of compute to the to the Start Time 5760.4 Duration 3.44
Text video clips um Start Time 5762.159 Duration 3.761
Text to pre-assign Start Time 5763.84 Duration 3.6
Text and guess what all the things are that Start Time 5765.92 Duration 2.96
Text are going on in the surround video and Start Time 5767.44 Duration 3.6
Text then there's like correcting it yeah and Start Time 5768.88 Duration 3.6
Text then all the human has to do is like Start Time 5771.04 Duration 3.76
Text tweet like say this you know chan adjust Start Time 5772.48 Duration 4.88
Text what is incorrect this this is like Start Time 5774.8 Duration 4.399
Text increasing increases productivity by Start Time 5777.36 Duration 3.839
Text effect 100 or more Start Time 5779.199 Duration 4.321

Text robotics problem Start Time 5812.719 Duration 3.92
Text i have to ask since i care about human Start Time 5814.48 Duration 4.08
Text robot interaction so the human side of Start Time 5816.639 Duration 3.921
Text that so you've talked about mostly in Start Time 5818.56 Duration 5.119
Text the factory do you see it uh also do you Start Time 5820.56 Duration 4.8
Text see part of this problem that tesla bot Start Time 5823.679 Duration 3.681
Text has to solve is interacting with humans Start Time 5825.36 Duration 3.68
Text and potentially having a place like in Start Time 5827.36 Duration 3.04
Text the home Start Time 5829.04 Duration 3.199
Text so interacting not just sure not Start Time 5830.4 Duration 4.239
Text replacing labor but also like Start Time 5832.239 Duration 3.44
Text i don't know Start Time 5834.639 Duration 2.401
