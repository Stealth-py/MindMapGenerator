00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,760
the following is a conversation with jay

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:04,640
baracaria professor of medicine health

3
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:06,640
policy and economics at stanford

4
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:08,160
university

5
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,400
please allow me to say a few words about

6
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:13,040
lockdowns and the blinding destructive

7
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:15,519
effects of arrogance on leadership

8
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:18,080
especially in the space of policy and

9
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:19,680
politics

10
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,920
jay barakaria is the co-author of the

11
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,320
now famous great barrington declaration

12
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:27,760
a one-page document that in october 2020

13
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:30,160
made a case against the effectiveness of

14
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:31,920
lockdowns

15
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,600
most of this podcast conversation is

16
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,239
about the ideas related to this document

17
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:38,879
and so let me say a few things here

18
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:41,440
about what troubles me

19
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,520
those who advocate for lockdowns as a

20
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,399
policy

21
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:46,320
often ignore the quiet suffering of

22
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,559
millions that it results in which

23
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:51,280
includes economic pain loss of jobs that

24
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,039
give meaning and pride in the face of

25
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:55,760
uncertainty the increase in suicide and

26
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:58,640
suicidal ideation and in general the

27
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,120
fear and anger that arises from the

28
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:04,000
powerlessness forced onto the populace

29
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,159
but the self-proclaimed elites and

30
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:08,000
experts

31
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,479
many folks whose job is unaffected by

32
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:12,720
the lockdowns talk down to the masses

33
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,880
about which path forward is right and

34
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,400
which is wrong

35
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,159
what troubles me most

36
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:20,240
is this very lack of empathy among the

37
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,799
policymakers for the common man

38
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:24,640
and in general for people unlike

39
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:27,520
themselves the landscape of suffering is

40
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,320
vast and must be fully considered in

41
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:33,040
calculating the response to the pandemic

42
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,240
with humility and with rigorous

43
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:39,200
open-minded scientific debate

44
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,119
jay and i talk about the email from

45
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:43,520
francis collins to anthony fauci that

46
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,399
called jay and his two co-authors

47
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:49,439
fringe epidemiologists and also called

48
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:51,520
for a devastating published takedown of

49
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,119
their ideas

50
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:55,200
these words from francis

51
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,960
broke my heart

52
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,520
i understand them i can even steel man

53
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,560
them

54
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,680
but nevertheless on balance they show to

55
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,560
me a failure of leadership

56
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,878
leadership in a pandemic is hard

57
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:10,560
which is why great leaders are

58
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,560
remembered by history

59
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,840
they are rare they stand out

60
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,400
and they give me hope

61
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,800
also this whole mess

62
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,800
inspires me on my small individual level

63
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,560
to do the right thing

64
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,640
in the face of conformity

65
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,360
despite the long odds

66
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,760
i talked to francis collins i talked to

67
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,000
albert burleigh pfizer ceo

68
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,400
i also talked and will continue to talk

69
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,840
with people like jay

70
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,840
and other dissenting voices that

71
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,080
challenge the mainstream narratives and

72
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,640
those in the seats of power

73
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,640
i hope to highlight both the strengths

74
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,200
and weaknesses in their ideas with

75
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,160
respect and empathy but also with guts

76
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,840
and skill

77
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,400
the skill part i hope to improve on over

78
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,680
time

79
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,640
and i do believe that conversation

80
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:04,239
and an open mind is the way out of this

81
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:06,959
and finally as i've said in the past i

82
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:08,319
value love

83
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:11,599
and integrity far far above money fame

84
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:12,800
and power

85
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,840
those latter three are all ephemeral

86
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,680
they slip through the fingers of anyone

87
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,760
who tries to hold on

88
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,319
and leave behind an empty shell of a

89
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:24,159
human being

90
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:26,480
i prefer to die a man who lived by

91
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,879
principles that nobody could shake and a

92
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:32,640
man who added a bit of love to the world

93
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,879
this is the lex friedman podcast to

94
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:37,200
support it please check out our sponsors

95
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,200
in the description and now here's my

96
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:43,760
conversation with jay batakaria

97
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,480
to our best understanding today how

98
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,319
deadly is coveted

99
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:50,319
do we have a good measure

100
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:52,560
for for this very question

101
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,120
so the the best evidence for covet the

102
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,360
deadline to covet comes from a whole

103
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,159
series of zero prevalent studies sierra

104
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:02,319
preference studies are these studies of

105
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:04,159
antibody prevalence in the population at

106
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:05,599
large

107
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:06,560
i was

108
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,000
part of the you know the very first set

109
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,360
of sierra problem studies one in santa

110
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,040
clara county one in l.a county and one

111
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,720
in the with major league baseball around

112
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,439
the u.s uh if i may just pause you for a

113
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:17,040
second

114
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,120
if people don't know what uh serology is

115
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,358
in cerro prevalence it does sound like

116
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:23,520
you say zero prevalence it's not it's

117
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,479
cerro and serology's antibodies so it's

118
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:28,479
it's a a survey that counts the number

119
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:31,040
of antibodies specifically

120
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,440
people that have antibodies

121
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,240
specific to kovaid which perhaps shows

122
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,639
an indication that they likely have had

123
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:40,800
cobit and therefore this is a way to

124
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,040
study how many people in the population

125
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,440
have been exposed to have had

126
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:48,160
exactly yeah exactly so the idea is that

127
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,320
uh

128
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,759
we don't know

129
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:53,440
exactly the number of people with cove

130
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,120
just by counting the people that are

131
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,479
there to present themselves with

132
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:58,720
symptoms of covid um covet has it turns

133
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,639
out a very wide range of symptoms

134
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:04,080
possible ranging from no symptoms at all

135
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,000
to this deadly viral pneumonia that's

136
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,240
killed so many people and the problem is

137
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,919
like in if you just count the number of

138
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:11,120
cases the people who have very few

139
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,840
symptoms so often don't show up for

140
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,520
testing we just don't they're outside of

141
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,000
the can of of public health

142
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,800
and so it's really hard to know that the

143
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,240
answer to your question without

144
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,520
understanding how many people are

145
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,280
infected because you you can probably

146
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,479
tell the number of deaths that's even

147
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:27,680
though there's some controversy over

148
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,400
that but uh that so that the numerators

149
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,240
is possible but the denominator is much

150
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,320
harder how much controversy is there

151
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,840
about the death we're gonna go on

152
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,560
million tangents is that okay we're

153
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,440
gonna i have a million questions so one

154
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,440
i love data so much

155
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,680
but i've like almost tuned out paying

156
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,759
attention to cover data because i feel

157
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:50,240
like i'm walking on shaky ground i don't

158
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,600
know who to trust

159
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,440
um maybe you can comment on different

160
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,000
sources of data different kinds of data

161
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,919
the death one that seems like a really

162
00:05:57,919 --> 00:05:59,120
important one

163
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,000
can we trust the reported deaths

164
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,919
associated with covid or is it just a

165
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:06,240
giant messy thing that mixed up and then

166
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,400
there's this kind of stories about

167
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,440
hospitals being incentivized

168
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,479
uh to report a death as covert death so

169
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:16,319
uh uh there's some truth in some of that

170
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:17,759
let me just so

171
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:19,440
let me just talk about the incentive so

172
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,440
in the united states

173
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:24,319
we passed this cares act that was aimed

174
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:25,039
at

175
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:26,479
making sure hospital assistance didn't

176
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:28,160
go bankrupt in the early days the

177
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,360
pandemic

178
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,360
the couple things they did one was they

179
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,600
provided incentives to treat covet

180
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,560
patients

181
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,880
tens of thousands of dollars extra per

182
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,639
per covered patient

183
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:40,240
um and the other thing they did is they

184
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,400
they gave a 20 bump to medicare payments

185
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,840
for elderly patients who are treated

186
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,440
with covet the idea is that there's more

187
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,720
expensive to treat them i guess the

188
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,039
early days um so that did provide an

189
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:51,039
incentive to sort of have have a lot of

190
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:53,039
code patients in the hospital because

191
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:54,639
your financial

192
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:56,400
success of the hospital or at least not

193
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,240
by the lack of financial ruin depended

194
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,560
on having many covered patients the

195
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,240
other thing on the death certificates is

196
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,680
that reporting of deaths is a separate

197
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,720
issue i don't know that there's a

198
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,800
financial incentive there but there is

199
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,880
this sort of like complicated you know

200
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,120
when you fill out a death certificate

201
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,520
for a patient with a lot of conditions

202
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,280
uh like let's say a patient has diabetes

203
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,280
a patient that well that diabetes could

204
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,120
lead to

205
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,479
heart failure you know you have a heart

206
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:23,120
attack heart failure your lungs fill up

207
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,520
then you get covered and

208
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,960
what and you die so what do you what do

209
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,160
you write on the death certificate was

210
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,599
it cause it covered the killed you was

211
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:31,919
it the lungs filling up was it the the

212
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:33,919
heart heart failure was it the diabetes

213
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:35,599
it's really difficult to like

214
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:36,960
disentangle

215
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,520
um and i think a lot of a lot of times

216
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,520
what's happened is they people have like

217
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,639
erred on the side of signing is covet

218
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,160
now what's the evidence of this there's

219
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,599
been a couple of

220
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:49,599
of audits of death certificates in

221
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:51,199
places like santa clara county where i

222
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:53,120
live in alameda county

223
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,520
uh california where they they carefully

224
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:56,560
went through the death certificate said

225
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,160
okay is this reasonable to say this was

226
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,759
actually covered or is it was covered

227
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:02,400
incidental and they found that about 25

228
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,639
20 25 of the deaths were

229
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:06,960
more likely incidental than directly due

230
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,240
to covet

231
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,919
i i personally don't get too excited

232
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:11,599
about this i mean it's a philosophical

233
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:13,919
question right like ultimately

234
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:15,599
what kills you

235
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:17,440
it's which is an odd thing to say if you

236
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,879
if you're if you're not you're not in

237
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:21,360
medicine but like really it's it's a

238
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,280
it's almost always multifactorial it's

239
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,120
always always just the bus hits you the

240
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,039
bus hits you that you get a brain bleed

241
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:28,479
was the brain bleed that killed you

242
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:30,479
would it burst anyway i mean you know

243
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:32,399
the bus hits you killed you right the

244
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:34,000
way you die is a philosophical question

245
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,679
but it's also a sociological and

246
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:37,360
psychological question because it seems

247
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,559
like

248
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:41,360
every single person who's passed away

249
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,279
over the past couple of years kind of

250
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:44,959
the first question that comes to mind is

251
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:47,360
just was it not not just because you're

252
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,880
trying to be political but just in your

253
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,040
mind no i think there's a psychological

254
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,200
reason for this right so um

255
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,120
you know we have we spent uh the better

256
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,040
part of a at least a half century in the

257
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,360
united states not worried too much

258
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,680
about infectious diseases and we the

259
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,200
notion was we'd essentially conquered

260
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,800
them it was something that happens in

261
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,680
faraway places to other people

262
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,800
and that's true for much of the

263
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,720
developed world life expectancies were

264
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,680
going up

265
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,839
for you know decades and decades

266
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:16,000
and for the first time in living memory

267
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,160
we have a disease that can kill us

268
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,240
i mean i think we're effectively evolved

269
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,720
to fear that like the the panic centers

270
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,080
of our brain the lizard part of our

271
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,839
brain takes over

272
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:28,160
and our central focus has been avoiding

273
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,760
this one risk

274
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:32,000
um and so it's not surprising that but

275
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,279
people when they're filling out death

276
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:35,360
certificates or thinking about what what

277
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,480
led to the death

278
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,640
this most salient thing that's in the

279
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,480
front of everyone's brain would jump to

280
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,240
the top

281
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,240
and we can't ignore

282
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,959
this very deep psychological thing when

283
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:49,120
we consider

284
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,040
what people say on the internet what

285
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,640
people say to each other what people

286
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,560
write in scientific papers what

287
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,360
everything it feels like

288
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,120
when covid

289
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,560
has been

290
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,320
um

291
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:05,040
has been brought onto this world

292
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,839
everything changed in the way people

293
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:10,000
feel about each other just the way they

294
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,720
communicate with each other i think

295
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,680
the the level of emotion involved

296
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,079
i think it in many people it brought out

297
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:20,480
the worst in them

298
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,160
for sometimes short periods of time and

299
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,160
sometimes it was always therapeutic like

300
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,760
you were waiting to get out like the

301
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,600
darkest parts of you

302
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,519
just to say if you're angry at something

303
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:31,600
in this world i'm going to say it now

304
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,920
and um i think that's probably talking

305
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,560
to some deep primal thing that

306
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:37,519
um

307
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:40,079
fear we have for um

308
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:41,839
formalities of all different kinds and

309
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:44,240
then when that fear is aroused and all

310
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,880
the deepest emotions it's like a

311
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,079
freudian

312
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:50,560
uh psychotherapy session but across the

313
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,880
world something that uh psychologists

314
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,480
are gonna have a field day with for

315
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,320
generation trying to understand um i

316
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,760
mean i think that

317
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,519
i mean what you say is right but piled

318
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:03,839
on top of that is also this sort of

319
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:06,640
uh this impetus to empathy to empathize

320
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,560
compassion toward others

321
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,959
essentially militarized

322
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:15,279
right so i'm protecting you by by some

323
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:16,399
actions

324
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:17,440
and

325
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,160
uh those actions if i if i don't do them

326
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,440
if you don't do them well that months

327
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,920
must mean you don't just you you hate me

328
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:26,240
um it's created this like social tension

329
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,920
that i've never seen before and we and

330
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,079
we start have started we started we

331
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:31,839
looked at each other as if we were just

332
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:33,120
simply

333
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,600
sources of of germs

334
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,760
rather than people to get to know

335
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,440
people to enjoy people to get you know

336
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:43,120
to learn from um it it colored

337
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,640
basically almost every human interaction

338
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:47,120
for every every human on the planet

339
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,839
yeah the basic common humanity it's like

340
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:51,680
you can wear a mask you can stand far

341
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:52,560
away

342
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:53,519
but the

343
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:54,800
love you have for each other when you

344
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,720
look into each other's eyes that was

345
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,399
dissipating and

346
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:01,040
by region too i've experienced having

347
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,959
traveled quite a bit throughout this

348
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:04,160
time

349
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,800
it um it was really sad even people that

350
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,720
are really close together just the way

351
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,639
they stood the way they looked at each

352
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:11,440
other

353
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,560
and i it made me feel for a moment

354
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:15,360
um

355
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,279
that the fabric that connects all of us

356
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,760
is more fragile than i thought

357
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,279
i mean if you walk down the street or if

358
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:23,120
you ever if you did this during covet

359
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,480
i'm sure you had this experience where

360
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,600
you walk down the street if you're not

361
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,600
wearing a mask or even if you are

362
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,440
people will jump off the off the

363
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,760
sidewalk as you walk past them

364
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:34,720
as if your poison

365
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,800
even though the data are that covet

366
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,880
spreads you know indifferently outdoors

367
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:41,360
or if at all really at outdoors

368
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,000
but it's not simply a biological or

369
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,440
infectious disease phenomenon or

370
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,360
immunological it's it is a it is a it's

371
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,000
a

372
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,240
it is a change in the way humans treated

373
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,639
each other i hope hope temporary

374
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:54,399
i do want to say on the flip side of

375
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:55,920
that so i was

376
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,320
mostly in boston massachusetts when the

377
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,000
pandemic broke out i think that's where

378
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,279
i was yeah

379
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:04,240
and then i got came here to austin texas

380
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:07,600
to visit my now good friend joe rogan

381
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,920
and he was the first person

382
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,839
without pause this wasn't a political

383
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:13,920
statement this was anything just walk

384
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,399
toward me and give me a big hug

385
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:18,560
and say it's great to see you and i

386
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,560
can't tell you how great it felt because

387
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,720
i in that moment realized the absence of

388
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,560
that connection back in boston over just

389
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,959
a couple of over a couple of months and

390
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:28,240
um

391
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,880
it's we'll talk about it more but it's

392
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,880
tragic to think about

393
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,200
that distancing that dissolution of

394
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,360
common humanity at scale what what kind

395
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:40,160
of impact it has on society just

396
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,639
across the board political division

397
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:44,880
uh and just in the quiet of your own

398
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,800
mind in the privacy of your own home the

399
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,040
depression the sadness the loneliness

400
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,040
that leads to suicide

401
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:53,839
and forget suicide just

402
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:56,880
low key suffering yeah no i think that's

403
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:59,279
that's the suffering that isolation

404
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:01,120
we're not meant to live alone we're not

405
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,399
meant to live apart from one another

406
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:03,839
that's of course the ideology of

407
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:06,560
lockdown is to make people live apart

408
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,480
alone isolated so that we don't spread

409
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,160
diseases to each other right

410
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,760
but we're not actually designed as a

411
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:14,000
species to live that way

412
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,680
and that uh what you're describing i

413
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:16,480
think

414
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,000
if everyone's honest with themselves

415
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,240
have felt uh especially in places where

416
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,160
that where lockdowns have been sort of

417
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,800
very militantly enforced has felt deep

418
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,240
into their core

419
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,920
well i if i could just return to the

420
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:30,800
question of deaths he said that the data

421
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,120
isn't perfect because we need these kind

422
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,519
of serial prevalence surveys to

423
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:37,920
understand how many cases there were to

424
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,839
determine the rate of deaths

425
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:42,079
and we need to have a strong footing in

426
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:43,600
the number of deaths but if we assume

427
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,880
that the the

428
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,480
the number of deaths is approximately

429
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,440
correct

430
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,600
like what's your sense what kind of

431
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,959
statements

432
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:53,120
can we say about the deadliness of covet

433
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,000
against

434
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,880
across different demographics maybe not

435
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,720
in a political way or in the current way

436
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:01,120
but when history looks back

437
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,279
at this moment of time

438
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:05,199
50 years from now 100 years from now the

439
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:07,040
way we look at the

440
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,600
pandemic 100 years ago

441
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,360
what will they say about the deadliness

442
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,760
of code i mean i think the deadlines of

443
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,920
kova depends on not just the virus

444
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:18,160
itself but who who it infects

445
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,600
um so the probably the most important

446
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,040
thing about it about the deadlines of

447
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:24,399
covet is is this steep age gradient in

448
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:27,199
the mortality rate um so according to

449
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:29,519
these zero prevalence studies that that

450
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:31,920
that have been done now hundreds of them

451
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:32,800
um

452
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,399
mostly from before vaccination because

453
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:36,079
vaccination also reduces the mortality

454
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:38,240
risk of covid um the the sierra

455
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,959
prevalent studies suggest that

456
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:43,120
the risk of of death if you're say over

457
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,720
the age of 70

458
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:45,920
is

459
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:48,720
very high if you have five percent

460
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,480
if you get covered

461
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,160
if you're if you're under the age of 70

462
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,279
it's lower

463
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:56,000
0.05 but there's not a single sharp cut

464
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,839
off it's more like i have a rule of

465
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:01,279
thumb that i use um so if you're 50

466
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:03,440
say the infection fatality rate from

467
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,959
covalent is 0.2

468
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:07,360
according to the zero prevalence data

469
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:10,160
that means 99.8 survival

470
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,480
if you're 50 and for every seven years

471
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:15,040
of age above that double it every seven

472
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,920
years of age below that have it

473
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:20,800
so 57 year old have a 0.4

474
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,800
mortality a 64 year old would have a

475
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,120
point eight percent and so on and uh if

476
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,880
you have a severe chronic disease like

477
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,720
diabetes or if you're more morbidly

478
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,959
obese it's like adding seven seven years

479
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:32,320
to your life

480
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,959
and this is uh for unvaccinated folks

481
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:37,600
this is unvaccinated uh in the before

482
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,959
delta also

483
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:40,399
are there a lot of people that will be

484
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:42,880
listening to this with phds at the end

485
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:45,040
of their name that would disagree with

486
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,759
the 99.8 would you say so i think

487
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:49,839
there's some disagreement over this uh

488
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:51,440
and the disagreement

489
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,279
is about the quality of the zero

490
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:56,079
prevalence studies that were conducted

491
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:58,160
so as i said earlier i was the senior

492
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,920
investigator in three different sierra

493
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,120
problem studies and very early in the

494
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,880
epidemic

495
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:05,280
i view them as very high quality studies

496
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:08,160
um we we um in santa clara county what

497
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:11,199
we did is we used a a test kit

498
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:14,079
uh to uh that we obtained

499
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:16,480
from uh someone who was works in major

500
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,640
league baseball actually he ordered

501
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:21,280
these test kits very early in march 2020

502
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:24,079
that measures very accurately measures

503
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:25,839
antibody levels

504
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:28,240
antibodies in the in in the bloodstream

505
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,000
uh these test kits were eventually were

506
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,880
approved by the the head of eua by the

507
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,840
emergency use authorization by the fda

508
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,679
sort of shortly after we did this

509
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:39,840
and uh it had a very low false positive

510
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:42,080
rate false plot of means if you if you

511
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,160
uh if you don't have these coveted

512
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,320
antibodies in your bloodstream the cut

513
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,320
kit shows up positive anyways that that

514
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,320
turns out to happen about point five

515
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,760
percent of the time

516
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:55,280
um and uh based on studies a very large

517
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,960
number of studies looking at

518
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:59,280
blood from 2018 you try it against this

519
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,480
kit

520
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,240
and uh you know point five percent of

521
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,840
the time 2018 there shouldn't be any

522
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,240
bodies there so for to cover if it turns

523
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,240
positive as a false positive 0.5 of the

524
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,600
time

525
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,280
um and then you know like a false

526
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,760
negative rate about 10

527
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,600
12 something like that i don't remember

528
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,679
the exact number but the false positive

529
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:18,799
rate is the important thing there right

530
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:21,440
so you have a population in march 2020

531
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,760
or april 2020 with very low

532
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,080
fraction of patients having been exposed

533
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,720
to code you don't know how much but low

534
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,559
even a small false positive rate could

535
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:31,919
end up

536
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:34,240
biasing your study quite a bit

537
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,919
but there's a formula to adjust for that

538
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:37,360
you can adjust for the fourth spot rate

539
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,960
falls negative rate we did we did that

540
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:42,240
adjustment and those studies found in a

541
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,080
community population so leaving aside

542
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,360
people in nursing homes who have a

543
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:48,480
higher death rate from covid um the that

544
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,480
the death rate was point two percent in

545
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,000
santa clara county

546
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,480
and in l.a county across all these

547
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,480
groups in the community community

548
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,559
meaning just like regular yeah so like

549
00:18:58,559 --> 00:18:59,600
that that's actually a real important

550
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:02,080
question too so uh the santa clara study

551
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:05,200
we did this facebook sampling scheme

552
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,679
um which is i mean not not the ideal

553
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:08,880
thing but just like it was very

554
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,200
difficult to get a random sample on and

555
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,679
during the you know during lockdown

556
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:16,960
um where we put out uh an ad on facebook

557
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,480
soliciting people to

558
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,320
volunteer for the study a randomly

559
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,640
selected set of people we were hoping to

560
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,080
get a random selection of people from

561
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,320
santa clara county but it tended to the

562
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:27,760
people who tend to volunteer were from

563
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,280
the richer parts of the county like i

564
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,000
had

565
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,520
stanford professors writing begging to

566
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:32,880
be in the study because they wanted

567
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,200
antibody levels so we did some

568
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,280
adjustment for that in la county we

569
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:40,640
hired a firm that had a pre-existing

570
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,960
representative sample of la county

571
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:43,840
um

572
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,840
so but it didn't include nursing homes

573
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,679
it didn't include people in jail things

574
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:48,799
like that didn't include the homeless

575
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:51,039
populations so it's it's representative

576
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:53,760
of a community dwelling population

577
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,880
both of those and there we found that

578
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,480
both in l.a county and santa clara

579
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:01,520
county in april 2020 something like 40

580
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:05,120
to 50 times more infections than cases

581
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,640
in both places

582
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:09,039
so for every case that had been reported

583
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:10,960
to the public health authorities we

584
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:14,240
found that you know you know 40 or 50

585
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,640
other infections people with antibodies

586
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:17,760
in their blood

587
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,520
that suggested that they'd had coveted

588
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,440
recovered so people were not reporting

589
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:24,080
or severe at least in those days under

590
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,919
reporting yeah i mean there was you know

591
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:27,360
there's testing problems there weren't

592
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,760
so many tests available people didn't

593
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,919
know a lot of a lot of them we asked a

594
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:33,280
set of questions about the symptoms

595
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,640
they've faced

596
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:35,840
and most of them said they faced no

597
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:38,000
symptoms or the most uh 30 40 of them

598
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,640
said face their no symptoms

599
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,400
and i mean even these days how many

600
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,240
people report that they get covered when

601
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,320
they get covered okay i'll have those

602
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:47,440
numbers

603
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,760
that point two percent has that

604
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,600
approximately held up over time that is

605
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,760
so if professor john ian edis who's a

606
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,600
colleague of mine at stanford uh is a

607
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:56,960
world expert in meta analysis probably

608
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,960
the most cited scientist on earth i

609
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:01,280
think uh at least living

610
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:03,520
he he did a a meta-analysis of now a

611
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,280
hundred or more of these cereal

612
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,360
prevalence studies

613
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:10,559
um and uh uh what he found was that that

614
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:12,480
point two percent is roughly the

615
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,480
worldwide number in fact i think he

616
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:17,280
cites this lower number 0.15 percent

617
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,360
as the median infection fatality rate

618
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,559
worldwide

619
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:22,799
so we did these studies and it generated

620
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:25,120
an enormous amount of blowback

621
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,880
by people who thought that the infection

622
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,320
rate is much higher

623
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,919
and there's some controversy over the

624
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:31,440
quality of some of the other studies

625
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,280
that that are done and so there are some

626
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,440
people who look at this same literature

627
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,440
and say well the the lower quality

628
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,600
studies tend to have lower ifrs

629
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,360
the higher quality studies how far oh

630
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,360
infection fatality right i apologize i

631
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:45,679
do this in lectures too

632
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:48,559
and i'm going to rudely interrupt you

633
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:51,039
and ask for uh for the basics sometimes

634
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:53,280
if it's okay no of course so these these

635
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,520
higher quality studies they say are tend

636
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,360
to produce higher but the problem is

637
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:00,080
that if you want a global eye infection

638
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,640
fatality rate you need to get

639
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,400
sierra problem studies from everywhere

640
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,000
even places that don't necessarily have

641
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,440
the infrastructure set up to produce

642
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,520
very very high quality studies

643
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:12,640
and in poor places in the world

644
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:15,200
this the the st that uh like places like

645
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,960
africa the infection fatality rate is

646
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,600
incredibly low

647
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:22,400
uh and in some richer places

648
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,760
like new york city the infection

649
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:26,640
fatality rate is is much higher

650
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:29,039
it's there's a range of ifrs not a

651
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:30,720
single number

652
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,720
this sometimes surprises people because

653
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,159
they think well it's a it's a virus it

654
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:35,280
should have the same properties no

655
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,640
matter where it goes

656
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:39,360
but the virus

657
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:42,960
kills or infects or hurts in interaction

658
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,640
with the host

659
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,640
and the properties of both the host and

660
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,760
the virus

661
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:50,320
combine to produce the the outcome but

662
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,880
you also mentioned the environment too

663
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,720
well it's i'm thinking mainly just about

664
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,320
the the person like if i'm gonna think

665
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:57,679
about it like the most simplest way to

666
00:22:57,679 --> 00:22:59,440
think about it is age age is the single

667
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,200
most important risk factor

668
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,520
so older places are going to have a

669
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,919
higher ifr

670
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:08,080
than younger places africa three percent

671
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:10,960
of africa is over 65. so in some sense

672
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:14,159
it's not surprising that they have a low

673
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:16,000
infection fatality rate so that's one

674
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,200
way you would explain the difference

675
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,960
between africa and new york city in

676
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:21,120
terms of the fatality rate is the age

677
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:23,120
the average age yeah and especially in

678
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:25,520
the early days of the epidemic in new

679
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:26,799
york city

680
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:27,679
the

681
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:28,480
uh

682
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,720
older populations living in nursing

683
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:33,280
homes were differentially infected

684
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:34,960
based on because of policies that were

685
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,960
adopted right to send

686
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,320
coveted infected patients back to

687
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,159
nursing homes to keep hospitals empty

688
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:41,679
what do you mean by differentially

689
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:42,799
infected

690
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:46,000
the policy that you adopt determines who

691
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,480
is most exposed right that okay so

692
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:51,360
that's what the policy it's the person

693
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:52,640
that matters

694
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,720
i mean it's not like the virus just kind

695
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:57,200
of it doesn't care i mean the policy

696
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,200
determines the nature of the interaction

697
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,880
and there's also i mean there is some

698
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,840
contribution from the

699
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:04,960
environment different regions have

700
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:07,520
different proximity maybe of people

701
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,279
interacting or the dynamics of the way

702
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:10,720
they interact

703
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,080
like if you have a if you have

704
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,360
situations where there's lots of

705
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:15,120
intergenerational

706
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,760
uh interactions yeah then you have a

707
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:20,000
very different risk profile than if than

708
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,240
if you have societies that are where

709
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,679
generations are more separate from one

710
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:24,640
another

711
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:25,679
um

712
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:27,200
okay so let me just finish real fast

713
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:30,240
about this so you you have in new york

714
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:33,360
you have a population that was infected

715
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:34,960
in the early days that was

716
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:37,520
very likely going to die but had a much

717
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:40,000
higher likelihood of dying if infected

718
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,039
and so new york city had a higher ifr

719
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:45,360
especially in the early days than um

720
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:48,799
than um then like africa has had

721
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:51,440
um the other thing is treatment right so

722
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:52,960
the treatments that we adopted in the

723
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,559
early days the epidemic i think actually

724
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:58,400
may have exacerbated the risk of death

725
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,000
which do so like

726
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
using ventilators like the the over

727
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,679
reliance on ventilators is what i'm

728
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:04,960
primarily thinking of but i can think of

729
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,000
other things

730
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,960
um but that that uh also we've learned

731
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:11,200
over time how better to manage patients

732
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,640
with the disease

733
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:13,919
so you have those you have all those

734
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:15,840
things combined so that's that's where

735
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,360
the controversy over this over this

736
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,120
number is i mean

737
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,880
new york city

738
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:24,159
also it has a is a central hub for those

739
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:25,679
who tweet

740
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:29,039
and uh those who write powerful stories

741
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:31,679
and narratives in article form

742
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:34,080
and i remember those quite dramatic

743
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:35,840
stories about sort of doctors in the

744
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,360
hospitals and these kinds of things i

745
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:40,480
mean there's very serious very dramatic

746
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:43,760
very tragic deaths going on always in

747
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:46,720
hospitals those stories

748
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:47,760
um

749
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:50,159
a lot of loved ones losing each other on

750
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:52,400
a deathbed that's always tragic and you

751
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,559
can always write a hell of a good story

752
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:57,039
about that and you should about the loss

753
00:25:57,039 --> 00:25:59,360
of loved ones but they were doing it

754
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:02,000
pretty pretty well i would say um over

755
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,720
this kind of dramatic deaths and so in

756
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:07,520
response to that it's very

757
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:10,159
unpleasant to hear even to consider the

758
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:11,919
possibility that

759
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:14,960
the death rate is not as high as you

760
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:18,159
might otherwise as you might feel yeah i

761
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:20,480
was surprised by the reaction

762
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,720
both by regular people and also the

763
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,720
scientific community in response to

764
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,480
those studies those early studies in

765
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:30,080
april of 2020 um uh to me they uh they

766
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:32,080
were there were studies i mean they're

767
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:34,159
they're the kinds of not exactly the

768
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:35,440
kinds of work i've worked on all my life

769
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:37,200
but it's kind of kind of like the kind

770
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,600
of you know like you you write a paper

771
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,919
and you get response responses from your

772
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:43,600
fellow scientists and you you know

773
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,039
change the paper to improve it uh you

774
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:47,120
have hopefully learned something from it

775
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:50,320
well but to push back it's just a study

776
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:52,080
but there's some studies and this is

777
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:54,159
kind of interesting because i've

778
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:56,400
received similar pushback on other

779
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,880
topics

780
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,400
there's

781
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,480
some studies that

782
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:03,520
if

783
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:07,760
wrong might have a wide ranging uh

784
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:10,000
detrimental effects on society so that's

785
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,360
that that's the way they would perceive

786
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:13,120
the studies if you say the death rate is

787
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:16,000
lower and you end up as you often do in

788
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,080
science realizing that nope that that

789
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:20,080
was there was a flaw in the way the

790
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:22,000
study was conducted or were just not

791
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,919
representative of a broader population

792
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:25,360
and then you realize the death rate is

793
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:27,600
much higher that might be very damaging

794
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:30,480
in in people's view uh so so that's

795
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:31,679
probably

796
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:33,840
where the scientific community sort of

797
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:37,279
just steal man the kind of response is

798
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:39,919
that's where they felt like you know

799
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:41,919
there's some findings where you better

800
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:44,880
be damn sure before you kind of report

801
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:45,679
them

802
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:47,039
yeah i mean we were pretty sure we were

803
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:48,480
right and it turns out we were right so

804
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,799
like when we so um

805
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:54,159
we released the the santa clara study

806
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:56,799
via this open open science process and

807
00:27:56,799 --> 00:27:59,120
this uh server called med med archive

808
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:02,080
it's it's designed for releasing studies

809
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:04,080
have not yet been pre-reviewed in order

810
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:05,919
to garner comment from the from

811
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:08,480
scientists before peer review

812
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,159
the the la county study we went through

813
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:12,240
the traditional peer review process

814
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,600
and got it published in the journal of

815
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,120
american medical association sometime in

816
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:17,679
like uh july i think forget the date of

817
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:18,960
2020.

818
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,880
the santa clara study released in april

819
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:23,200
of 2020 in this you know sort of working

820
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,039
paper archive

821
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:26,960
the the reason was that we felt we had

822
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:29,919
an obligation we had a result that was

823
00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:31,760
we thought was quite important

824
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:34,080
and we wanted to tell the scientific

825
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,520
community about it and also tell the

826
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:36,640
world about it

827
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,000
and it wasn't we wanted to get feedback

828
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,840
i mean that's part of the purpose of

829
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:42,159
sending it to these kinds of places

830
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:45,039
i think a lot of the problem is that

831
00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:46,960
uh when people think about published

832
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,640
science they think of it as

833
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,799
automatically true and if it goes

834
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:52,000
through peer review it's automatically

835
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:52,960
true if it hasn't gone through peer

836
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:55,039
review it's not automatically true and

837
00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:57,440
especially in medicine when we're not

838
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:00,480
used to having this at this access to

839
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,799
pre-peer-reviewed

840
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:04,640
work i mean in economics actually that's

841
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:07,200
quite normal you it takes years to get

842
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,960
something published so there's a very

843
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:11,919
active debate over or discussion about

844
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:13,520
papers before they're peer-reviewed in

845
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,840
this in this sort of working paper way

846
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:18,559
um much less normal or much much newer

847
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:20,240
in in medicine

848
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:21,600
and so i think part of that the

849
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:24,000
perception about what those that what

850
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,480
process happens in open science when you

851
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:27,840
release a study

852
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:29,520
that that got people confused and you're

853
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,360
right it was a very important result

854
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:33,200
because we had just locked the world

855
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:36,000
down in middle of march

856
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,559
with i think catastrophic results

857
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:40,480
and if the if that study was right if

858
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,480
our study was right that meant we'd made

859
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:43,840
a mistake

860
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:45,679
and not because the death rate was low

861
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:47,679
that's actually not the key thing there

862
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:50,159
the key thing is that we had adopted

863
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:52,559
these policies these test and trace

864
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:54,799
policies these policies these lockdown

865
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:58,080
policies aimed at suppressing the virus

866
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:00,240
level to close to zero that was

867
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:01,760
essentially the idea

868
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:04,559
if we can just get the virus to go away

869
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:05,760
we won't have to ever worry about it

870
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,279
again

871
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:09,520
the main problem with our result as far

872
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:10,880
as that strategy was concerned wasn't

873
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:13,200
the death rate it was the 40 to 50 times

874
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,039
more infections than cases it was the

875
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:17,039
two and a half percent or uh three

876
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:19,360
percent or four percent prevalence rate

877
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:21,120
that we identified

878
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:23,039
of the antibodies in the population if

879
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:25,760
that number is right it's too late the

880
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:27,919
virus is not going to go to zero

881
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:29,679
and no matter how much we test and trace

882
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:31,200
and isolate we're not going to get the

883
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,840
viral level down to zero

884
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,520
so we're going to have to

885
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,200
let the virus go through the entire

886
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,039
population in some way or something

887
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:40,480
normal well that we can talk about that

888
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:41,840
in a bit that's the great barrington

889
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,039
declaration you don't have to let the

890
00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:44,480
virus go through the population you can

891
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,960
shield preferentially

892
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:49,039
the policy we chose was to shield

893
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:52,000
preferentially the the laptop class

894
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,520
the set of people who could work from

895
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:54,399
home

896
00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:56,320
without losing their job

897
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:58,240
yeah and we did a very good job at

898
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:02,080
protecting them well let me um

899
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:04,559
take a small tangent we're gonna jump

900
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:06,480
around in time

901
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:08,000
which i think will be the best way to

902
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,480
tell the story so that was the beginning

903
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,799
yeah okay actually can i kind of go back

904
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:14,080
one more thing for that because that's

905
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,200
really important and i should have i

906
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,720
should have started with this

907
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:20,320
um what led me to do those studies

908
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,720
was a a paper that i had remembered

909
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:25,600
seeing from the h1n1 flu epidemic in

910
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,440
2009 this is this is where i've been

911
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:29,120
much less active in writing about that i

912
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:30,880
had written up like a paper or two about

913
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:34,240
that when in 2009

914
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:36,399
there there was actually this same

915
00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:38,720
debate over the mortality rate

916
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,559
except it unfolded over the course of

917
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:43,120
three years two or three years

918
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:44,799
the early studies

919
00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:46,480
of the mortality rate

920
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:51,039
in h1n1 counted the number of cases

921
00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:52,720
in the denominator count the number of

922
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,159
deaths in the numerator cases meaning

923
00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:56,880
people identified as having h1n1 showing

924
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,159
up the doctor

925
00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:01,279
you know tested to have it um and the

926
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:03,919
early estimates of the h1n1 mortality

927
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:06,799
were like four percent three percent

928
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:08,799
really really high

929
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:10,480
over the course of a couple of more

930
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:12,480
years a whole bunch of zero prevalence

931
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:14,320
studies zero prevalence studies of h1n1

932
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:15,679
flu came out

933
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:18,240
and it turned out that there were

934
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,880
a hundred or more times of people

935
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:23,120
infected per case

936
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:24,720
and so the mortality rate was actually

937
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:27,360
something like 0.02

938
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:30,320
for h1n1 not the three three

939
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:32,320
like a hundredfold difference so this

940
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:33,679
made you think

941
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:35,760
okay it took us a couple of two to three

942
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:37,760
years to discover the truth behind the

943
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:39,919
actual infections

944
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:42,799
uh for a h1n1 and then

945
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:44,320
what's the truth here and can we get

946
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:46,320
there faster yeah and and there was it

947
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:48,080
spreads in a similar way as the as the

948
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:49,840
h1n1 fluid did i mean it's it's spreads

949
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:52,399
very solidization via you know so

950
00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:53,919
person-to-person breathing kind of kind

951
00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:56,480
of contact up um and maybe maybe some by

952
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:57,919
by foam eyes but it seems like that's

953
00:32:57,919 --> 00:33:00,559
less likely now in any case it seemed

954
00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:02,960
really important to me to speed up the

955
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:04,720
process of having those zero prevalence

956
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:05,760
studies

957
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:07,840
so that we can better understand who was

958
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:08,960
at risk

959
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:12,080
and what the right strategy ought to be

960
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:15,039
this might be a good place to kind of

961
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:17,200
compare influenza

962
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:20,399
the flu and covid in the context of the

963
00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:22,640
discussion we just had which is

964
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:25,039
how deadly is coved so you mentioned

965
00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:26,880
covet is a very particular kind of

966
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:29,200
steepness

967
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:32,080
where the x-axis is age

968
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:33,440
so

969
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,360
in that context could you maybe compare

970
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:37,760
influenza and kovid because a lot of

971
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,840
people

972
00:33:40,399 --> 00:33:42,960
outside the folks who suggest that the

973
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:45,279
the lizards who run the world have

974
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:48,320
completely fabricated invented kovid

975
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:50,320
outside of those folks kind of the

976
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:51,360
natural

977
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,200
process by which you dismiss the threat

978
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,440
of covait to say well it's just like the

979
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:57,120
flu the flu is a very serious thing

980
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:59,440
actually um so

981
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:01,679
in that comparison

982
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:03,600
where does kovitz stand

983
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:04,960
yeah the flu is a very serious thing it

984
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:07,760
kills you know 50 60 000 people a year

985
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:09,040
something i found that order depending

986
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,719
on the the particular strain that goes

987
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:12,639
around uh that's in the united states

988
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:14,879
the primary difference to me are the

989
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:16,079
there's lots of differences but one of

990
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:18,159
the most salient differences is the age

991
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:21,359
gradient and mortality risk for the flu

992
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:24,079
so the flu is more deadly for two

993
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:26,560
children than covet is

994
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:29,359
there's no controversy about that

995
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:31,679
children thank god

996
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:33,520
have much less

997
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:34,960
uh severe

998
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:38,000
reactions to covet infection to than

999
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,960
that due to flu infections and rate of

1000
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:42,960
fatalities fatality all of that i think

1001
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,639
you mentioned um

1002
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:46,000
i mean it's interesting to maybe also

1003
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,839
comment on i think in another

1004
00:34:47,839 --> 00:34:49,918
conversation mentioned there's a u

1005
00:34:49,918 --> 00:34:51,040
shape

1006
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,879
to the

1007
00:34:52,879 --> 00:34:54,320
to the flu curve

1008
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:56,320
so meaning like there's actually quite a

1009
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:59,119
large number of kids that die from flu

1010
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:02,320
yeah i mean the 1918 flu the h1n1 flew

1011
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:04,960
that the spanish flu in the us killed

1012
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:09,359
millions of of of uh of younger people

1013
00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:13,440
and um that is not the case with covid

1014
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:15,040
more than um

1015
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:16,800
i'm going to get the number wrong but

1016
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,800
something like 70 80 percent of the

1017
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:21,599
deaths are people over the age of 60.

1018
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:23,040
well we've talked about the fear the

1019
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:24,880
whole time really

1020
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:27,760
but my interaction with folks

1021
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:29,200
now i want to have a family i want to

1022
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:31,839
have kids but i don't have that real

1023
00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:33,359
firsthand experience but my interaction

1024
00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:35,680
with folks is at the core of fear

1025
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:37,839
that folks had

1026
00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:39,839
is for their children

1027
00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:41,520
like

1028
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:42,880
that

1029
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:45,040
somehow you know i don't want to get

1030
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:47,760
infected because of the kids like

1031
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,760
because god forbid something happens to

1032
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:51,760
the kids and i think

1033
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:54,400
that obviously that makes a lot of sense

1034
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,440
this kind of

1035
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:57,280
the kids come first no matter what

1036
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,760
that's number one priority but in for

1037
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:02,000
this particular virus

1038
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,160
that reasoning was um

1039
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:05,920
not grounded in data it seems like or

1040
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:08,079
that emotion and feeling yeah it was not

1041
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:10,560
grounded it wasn't at the same time this

1042
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:12,400
is way more deadly than the flu just

1043
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:15,359
overall and especially to older people

1044
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:16,400
yes

1045
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,720
right so the numbers when when the story

1046
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:19,440
is

1047
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:20,960
all said and done

1048
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,880
the covet would take

1049
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,960
many more lives yeah

1050
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,960
so i mean 0.2 is sounds like a small

1051
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,480
number but it's not a small number

1052
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:30,400
worldwide what do you think that number

1053
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:31,359
will be

1054
00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:33,280
by the you know that's not that's not

1055
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:36,160
like but would we cross i think it's in

1056
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:39,119
the united states it's uh

1057
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:40,800
the way the desk currently reports like

1058
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,960
800 000 something like that do you think

1059
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:46,160
we'll cross a million seems likely

1060
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:48,240
yeah do you think it's something that

1061
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:50,240
might continue with different variants

1062
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:52,240
what well i i think um so we can talk

1063
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:53,520
about the end state of cover the end

1064
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:56,160
state of covet is it's here forever

1065
00:36:56,160 --> 00:37:00,240
i think that there is good evidence of

1066
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:04,320
immunity after infection

1067
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:06,240
such that you're protected both against

1068
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:08,800
reinfection and also against severe

1069
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:11,200
disease upon reinfection

1070
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:12,960
so the second time you get it it's not

1071
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,560
true for everyone but for many people

1072
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:15,839
the second time you get it will be

1073
00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:17,920
milder much milder than the first time

1074
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:21,200
you get it with the long tail like uh

1075
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:23,520
that lasts for a long time yeah so just

1076
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:25,599
there's studies that uh that follow of

1077
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:27,200
course people who are infected for a

1078
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:28,160
year

1079
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:29,680
and the reinfection rate is something

1080
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:31,599
like somewhere between point three and

1081
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:35,040
one percent yeah um and like a pretty

1082
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:36,720
fantastic study italy's found that

1083
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:38,640
there's there was one in sweden i think

1084
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:40,000
there's a few studies that found there's

1085
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,040
some similar things um and the

1086
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,880
reinfections

1087
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:47,040
tend to produce much mild disease much

1088
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:48,480
less likely end up in the hospital much

1089
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:51,520
less likely to die um so what the end

1090
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:53,599
state of covid is it's circulating the

1091
00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:54,960
population forever and you get it

1092
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,400
multiple times

1093
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,599
yeah

1094
00:37:57,599 --> 00:37:59,040
and and then there's

1095
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:01,760
i think studies and discussions like the

1096
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:04,160
the best protection would be to get it

1097
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:06,480
and then also to get vaccinated and then

1098
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:08,640
a lot of people push back against that

1099
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:10,640
for the obvious reasons from both sides

1100
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:12,640
because somehow this the discourse has

1101
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:13,920
become less scientific and more

1102
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:16,480
political well i think you wanna like

1103
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:18,480
the first time you meet it is going to

1104
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:20,160
be the most deadly for you

1105
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,680
and so the first time you meet it is

1106
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:23,200
wise to be vaccinated the vaccine

1107
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:25,280
reduces severe disease

1108
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:27,520
yeah well we'll talk about the vaccine

1109
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:29,040
because i want to make sure i address it

1110
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,079
carefully

1111
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:33,599
and properly in full context

1112
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:34,880
um

1113
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:37,920
but yes sort of uh to add to the context

1114
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:39,680
a lot of the fascinating discussions

1115
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:42,160
we're having is um in the early days of

1116
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:45,040
covid and now for people who are

1117
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:46,800
unvaccinated that's where the

1118
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,960
interesting story is

1119
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:51,040
the policy story the sociology

1120
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:53,839
sociological story and so on but

1121
00:38:53,839 --> 00:38:55,040
let me go to something really

1122
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:57,040
fascinating just because of the people

1123
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:59,440
involved the human beings evolved and

1124
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:02,079
because of how deeply i care about

1125
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:04,720
science and also kindness respect and

1126
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:07,680
love and human things

1127
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:10,240
francis collins wrote a letter in

c

1135
00:39:25,839 --> 00:39:29,280
gb declaration.org

1136
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,880
this proposal

1137
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:32,880
this is the great barrington declaration

1138
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:35,599
that you're a co-author on this proposal

1139
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:38,560
from the three fringe epidemiologists

1140
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:40,480
who met with the secretary seem to be

1141
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:42,560
getting a lot of attention and even a

1142
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:45,920
co-signature from nobel prize winner

1143
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:48,480
mike levitt at stanford

1144
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,160
there needs to be a quick and

1145
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:53,119
devastating published takedown

1146
00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:54,640
of its premises

1147
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:57,200
i don't see anything like that online

1148
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:00,320
yet is it underway question mark francis

1149
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:03,200
francis collins director of the nih

1150
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:04,800
somebody i talked to on this podcast

1151
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,000
recently

1152
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,599
okay

1153
00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:09,920
a million questions i want to ask but

1154
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:12,640
first how did that make you feel when

1155
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:13,760
you first

1156
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:17,359
saw this uh email come to uh

1157
00:40:17,359 --> 00:40:19,760
uh too light which when when when did it

1158
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:21,839
come to light uh this week actually i

1159
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:23,680
think or last week okay so this is

1160
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:26,240
because of freedom of information yeah

1161
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:27,920
which by the way

1162
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:29,680
sort of um

1163
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:31,760
maybe because i do want to add positive

1164
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:34,640
stuff on the on the side of francis here

1165
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:36,240
um

1166
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:38,319
boy when i see stuff like that i wonder

1167
00:40:38,319 --> 00:40:40,960
if all my emails leaked

1168
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:43,440
how much embarrassing stuff like i think

1169
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:44,960
i'm a good person

1170
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:46,880
but i don't

1171
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:50,160
i haven't read my old emails maybe i'm

1172
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:51,920
pretty sure sometimes later i could be

1173
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:53,119
an

1174
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:54,960
well i mean look he's a christian and

1175
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:56,640
i'm a christian i'm supposed to forgive

1176
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:58,079
right i mean i think

1177
00:40:58,079 --> 00:41:01,440
he was looking at this

1178
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,720
great barrington declaration as a

1179
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:05,200
political problem to be solved

1180
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:08,000
as opposed to a serious alternative

1181
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,920
approach to the epidemic

1182
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:12,160
so maybe we'll talk about in more detail

1183
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:14,480
but just for in case people are not

1184
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:16,160
familiar great barrington declaration

1185
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:17,040
was

1186
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:18,800
was was the document

1187
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:20,720
that you co-authored

1188
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:23,200
that basically argues against this idea

1189
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:26,240
of lock down as a solution to covid and

1190
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:28,560
you propose another solution that we'll

1191
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:30,560
talk about but the point is

1192
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:31,920
it's not

1193
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:34,800
that dramatic of a document

1194
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,880
it is just a document that criticizes

1195
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:39,119
one policy solution that was but it was

1196
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:40,640
the policy solution that had been put

1197
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:42,160
forward by

1198
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:44,800
dr collins and by tony fauci

1199
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:47,040
and a few other few other science not i

1200
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:48,800
mean i think a relatively small number

1201
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,960
of scientists and epidemiologists in

1202
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:53,280
charge of

1203
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:55,040
the advice given to governments

1204
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:56,560
worldwide

1205
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:59,920
and it was a challenge to that policy

1206
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:01,839
that said that look there there is an

1207
00:42:01,839 --> 00:42:04,000
alternate path that that the path we've

1208
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,240
chosen this path of lock down with an

1209
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:08,240
aim to suppress the virus to zero

1210
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:11,280
effectively i mean that was unstated um

1211
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:13,760
cannot work and is causing catastrophic

1212
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:15,359
harm to

1213
00:42:15,359 --> 00:42:16,880
large numbers of poor and vulnerable

1214
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:19,200
people worldwide

1215
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:21,599
we put this out in october 4th i think

1216
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:23,440
of 2020

1217
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:24,400
and

1218
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:26,560
it went viral i mean i've never actually

1219
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:28,480
been involved with anything like like

1220
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:30,640
this where i just put the document on

1221
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:31,520
the web

1222
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:33,760
and tens of thousands of doctors signed

1223
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:35,520
on hundreds of thousands of regular

1224
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:37,119
people signed on

1225
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:39,760
it it really struck a accord of uh

1226
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:41,200
people because i think even by october

1227
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:43,119
of 2020 people had this sense that there

1228
00:42:43,119 --> 00:42:44,960
was something really wrong

1229
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:46,400
with the coveted policy that we've been

1230
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:48,079
following

1231
00:42:48,079 --> 00:42:51,200
and they were looking for

1232
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:52,800
reasonable people to give an alternative

1233
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:54,400
i mean we're not arguing that covet

1234
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:56,720
doesn't isn't a serious thing i mean it

1235
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:58,160
is a very serious thing this is why we

1236
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:00,720
we had a policy that aimed at addressing

1237
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:01,520
it

1238
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:02,319
um

1239
00:43:02,319 --> 00:43:04,400
we were but we were saying that the

1240
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:06,319
policy we're following is not the right

1241
00:43:06,319 --> 00:43:08,079
one

1242
00:43:08,079 --> 00:43:10,079
so how does a democratic

1243
00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:13,440
uh government deal with that challenge

1244
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:15,839
uh so to me that you asked me how i felt

1245
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:18,160
i was actually frankly just i was i i

1246
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:19,760
suspected there had been some email

1247
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:21,520
exchanges like that not necessarily from

1248
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:23,040
francis collins

1249
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:24,960
around the government around this

1250
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:27,440
time i mean i felt the full brunt of a

1251
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:30,319
propaganda campaign

1252
00:43:30,319 --> 00:43:32,319
almost immediately after we published it

1253
00:43:32,319 --> 00:43:35,119
where newspapers mischaracterized it in

1254
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:36,880
all in the same the same way over and

1255
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:39,200
over and over again

1256
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:40,720
and sought to

1257
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:43,200
characterize me as sort of of a as a

1258
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:44,640
sort of a marginal fringe figure or

1259
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:46,800
whatnot and me and sinatra grouped uh

1260
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:48,319
martin culdor for the tens of thousands

1261
00:43:48,319 --> 00:43:50,160
of other people that signed it

1262
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:52,079
i felt the brunt of that

1263
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:53,440
all year long

1264
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:56,800
so to see this in black and white in you

1265
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:58,400
know with the handwriting essentially if

1266
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:00,240
i mean the the metaphorical handwriting

1267
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:01,440
of francis collins was actually frankly

1268
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:03,440
a disappointment because i i've looked

1269
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:05,200
up to him for years

1270
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:07,520
yeah i've looked up them as well

1271
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:09,359
i um

1272
00:44:09,359 --> 00:44:12,079
i mean i look for the the best in people

1273
00:44:12,079 --> 00:44:13,359
and

1274
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:15,200
i still look up to him

1275
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:18,880
what troubles me is several things

1276
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:21,760
the reason i said about the

1277
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:23,839
the emails that i send late at

1278
00:44:23,839 --> 00:44:25,119
night

1279
00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:26,800
is um

1280
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:29,839
i can understand this email

1281
00:44:29,839 --> 00:44:34,160
it's fear it's panic not being sure

1282
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:37,280
the fringe three fringe epidemiologists

1283
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:39,760
plus mike levitt who won a nobel prize i

1284
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:43,119
mean but using fringe

1285
00:44:43,119 --> 00:44:45,920
maybe in my private thoughts i have said

1286
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:47,839
things like that about others

1287
00:44:47,839 --> 00:44:50,560
like a little bit too unkind like you

1288
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:52,160
don't really mean it

1289
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:54,000
now add to that

1290
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:54,880
he

1291
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:57,200
recently this week whatever

1292
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:58,079
uh

1293
00:44:58,079 --> 00:45:00,160
double down on the fringe

1294
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:02,400
this is really troubling to me

1295
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:05,520
that like i can excuse this email but

1296
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:08,079
to see the arrogance there

1297
00:45:08,079 --> 00:45:10,880
i that francis honestly i mean

1298
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:12,800
broke my heart a little bit there this

1299
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:14,720
was an opportunity to like especially at

1300
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:16,000
this stage

1301
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,520
to say

1302
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:20,240
just like i told him um

1303
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:22,240
to say i was wrong to use those words in

1304
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:23,599
that email

1305
00:45:23,599 --> 00:45:26,240
i was i was wrong to not be open to

1306
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:27,280
ideas

1307
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:29,920
i still believe that this is not like

1308
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:30,960
say

1309
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:33,040
like actually argue with the with the

1310
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:35,200
proposed with the policy of the proposed

1311
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:38,640
uh solution also

1312
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:42,800
the devastating publish take devastating

1313
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:44,240
takedown

1314
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:47,040
devastating takedown as you say

1315
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:49,040
somebody who's sitting

1316
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:51,760
on billions of dollars that they're

1317
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:53,440
giving to

1318
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:54,640
scientists

1319
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:57,200
some of whom are often not their best

1320
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:58,960
human beings because they're fighting

1321
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:01,119
with each other over money not being

1322
00:46:01,119 --> 00:46:04,720
cognizant of the fact that you're

1323
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:06,800
challenging the integrity you're

1324
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:08,720
corrupting the integrity of scientists

1325
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:10,720
by allocating the money

1326
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:13,359
you're now playing with that

1327
00:46:13,359 --> 00:46:16,000
by saying devastating takedown

1328
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,680
where do you think the published

1329
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:19,440
takedown will come from

1330
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:21,599
it will come from those scientists to

1331
00:46:21,599 --> 00:46:24,000
whom you're giving money what kind of

1332
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,480
example would they give to the academic

1333
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:29,119
community that thrives on freedom like

1334
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:30,800
this this is

1335
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:34,400
i believe francis collins is a great man

1336
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:36,800
one of the things i was troubled by is

1337
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:39,200
the negative response to him from people

1338
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:41,359
that don't understand the positive

1339
00:46:41,359 --> 00:46:44,079
impact that nih has had on society how

1340
00:46:44,079 --> 00:46:46,800
many people has helped but this is

1341
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:50,000
exactly the so he's not just a scientist

1342
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,160
he's not just a bureaucrat who

1343
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:54,800
distributes money he's also a scientific

1344
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:55,680
leader

1345
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:57,920
that in the time in difficult times we

1346
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:00,560
live in is supposed to inspire us with

1347
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:04,160
trust with love with the freedom of

1348
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:06,560
thought he's supposed to you know those

1349
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:09,119
fringe epidemiologists those are the

1350
00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:11,680
heroes of science when you look at the

1351
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:15,520
long arc of history we love those people

1352
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:17,760
we love ideas even when they get proven

1353
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:19,520
wrong that's what always that attracted

1354
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:21,760
me to science like some somebody like

1355
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:25,040
the the lone voice saying oh no the the

1356
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:28,160
the moon of jupiter does move

1357
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:29,839
yeah i mean you know but the funny thing

1358
00:47:29,839 --> 00:47:31,839
is you know galileo is saying something

1359
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:33,839
truly revolutionary we were saying

1360
00:47:33,839 --> 00:47:35,040
that what we proposed in the great

1361
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:36,720
britain declaration was actually just

1362
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:38,800
the old pandemic plan

1363
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:40,720
it wasn't anything really

1364
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:43,040
fundamentally novel

1365
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:44,800
in fact there were

1366
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:48,000
plans like this that

1367
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,559
lockdown scientists had written in late

1368
00:47:50,559 --> 00:47:53,040
february early march of 2020. so we were

1369
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:54,720
not saying anything radical we were just

1370
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:56,319
calling for a debate

1371
00:47:56,319 --> 00:47:59,040
effectively over the existing lockdown

1372
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:00,319
policy

1373
00:48:00,319 --> 00:48:03,040
um and this is a disappointment a really

1374
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:05,520
truly a big disappointment because

1375
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:07,119
by doing this

1376
00:48:07,119 --> 00:48:09,040
you were absolutely right lex he sent a

1377
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:10,079
signal

1378
00:48:10,079 --> 00:48:12,720
to so many other scientists to just stay

1379
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:15,040
silent even if you had reservations

1380
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:18,319
yeah devastating takedown the people you

1381
00:48:18,319 --> 00:48:20,160
know how many people wrote to me

1382
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:23,760
privately like stanford mit

1383
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:25,280
how amazing

1384
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:27,119
the conversation with francis collins

1385
00:48:27,119 --> 00:48:28,079
was

1386
00:48:28,079 --> 00:48:31,760
there's a kind of admiration because

1387
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:35,760
okay how do i put it um

1388
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:37,359
a lot of people

1389
00:48:37,359 --> 00:48:38,880
get into science because they want to

1390
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:40,319
help the world

1391
00:48:40,319 --> 00:48:42,640
they get excited by the ideas and they

1392
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:45,440
and they they really are working hard to

1393
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:48,000
help in whatever the discipline is and

1394
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,640
then there is sources of funding

1395
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:53,200
which help you do help at a larger scale

1396
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:56,079
so you admire those the people that uh

1397
00:48:56,079 --> 00:48:56,960
um

1398
00:48:56,960 --> 00:48:58,480
are distributing the money because

1399
00:48:58,480 --> 00:48:59,680
they're often

1400
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:02,079
at least on the surface are really also

1401
00:49:02,079 --> 00:49:03,760
good people oftentimes they're great

1402
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:06,960
scientists so like it's amazing i that's

1403
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:10,559
why i'm sort of um

1404
00:49:10,559 --> 00:49:12,240
like sometimes people from outside think

1405
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:14,720
academia is broken some kind of way no

1406
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:16,800
it's it's a beautiful thing it's a it's

1407
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:18,079
really is a beautiful thing and that's

1408
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:19,920
why it's so deeply heartbreaking where

1409
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:21,440
this person

1410
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:22,559
um

1411
00:49:22,559 --> 00:49:26,319
is um i don't think this is malevolence

1412
00:49:26,319 --> 00:49:28,559
i think he's just incompetence of

1413
00:49:28,559 --> 00:49:30,480
communication

1414
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:32,160
twice i think there's there's also

1415
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:33,760
arrogance at the bottom of it too so

1416
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:35,280
like but you know all of us have

1417
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:37,200
arrogance yeah there's a particular kind

1418
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:39,040
of arrogance right so here it's it's of

1419
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:41,200
the same kind of arrogance that you see

1420
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:44,480
when tony fauci gets on tv and says that

1421
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:46,800
uh that if you criticize me you're not

1422
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:48,559
simply criticizing a man you're

1423
00:49:48,559 --> 00:49:50,960
criticizing science itself right right

1424
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:54,880
that is at the heart also of this email

1425
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:56,960
this so the certainty

1426
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:58,800
that the policies that they were

1427
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:00,400
recommending collins and fauci were

1428
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:01,760
recommending to the president of the

1429
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:04,079
united states were right not just right

1430
00:50:04,079 --> 00:50:06,960
but right so so far right that any

1431
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:10,480
challenge whatsoever to it is dangerous

1432
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:12,720
um and i think that that is really the

1433
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:14,720
heart of that email it's it's um it's

1434
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:17,280
this idea that

1435
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:19,680
my position is unchallengeable

1436
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:21,839
not to be to be complete to be as

1437
00:50:21,839 --> 00:50:24,480
charitable as i can be to this you know

1438
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:25,920
i believe they thought that i believe

1439
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:28,079
they some of them still think that that

1440
00:50:28,079 --> 00:50:30,720
that there was only one true policy

1441
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:32,800
possible in response to copenhagen every

1442
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:36,079
other policy was immoral

1443
00:50:36,079 --> 00:50:37,280
and if you if you come from that

1444
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:38,800
position then you write an email like

1445
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:42,240
that you go on tv you say effectively

1446
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:43,920
right i mean that that is that is what

1447
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:46,240
happens when you have this sort of

1448
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:47,760
unchallengeable arrogance that the

1449
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:49,599
policy you're following is correct

1450
00:50:49,599 --> 00:50:51,119
um i mean when we wrote the great bank

1451
00:50:51,119 --> 00:50:52,079
declaration

1452
00:50:52,079 --> 00:50:53,680
what i was hoping for

1453
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:55,599
was a discussion

1454
00:50:55,599 --> 00:50:57,680
about how to protect the vulnerable i

1455
00:50:57,680 --> 00:50:59,440
mean that was the key idea to me in the

1456
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:00,800
whole thing was

1457
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:02,319
better protection of the older

1458
00:51:02,319 --> 00:51:04,319
population who really at really serious

1459
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:06,559
risk if infected with covid and we had

1460
00:51:06,559 --> 00:51:08,640
been doing a very poor job i thought to

1461
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:10,400
date in many places in protecting the

1462
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:12,160
vulnerable

1463
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:14,800
and what i wanted was a discussion by

1464
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:16,480
local public health

1465
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:18,720
about better methods better policies to

1466
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:21,359
protect the vulnerable

1467
00:51:21,359 --> 00:51:24,319
so when when i was when we were met with

1468
00:51:24,319 --> 00:51:26,640
instead a series of essentially

1469
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:28,880
propagandist lies about it so they for

1470
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:31,440
instance i kept hearing from reporters

1471
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:33,599
in in those days why do you want to let

1472
00:51:33,599 --> 00:51:35,839
the virus rip let it rip let it rip the

1473
00:51:35,839 --> 00:51:37,520
words let it rip

1474
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:40,000
does not appear in the great barrington

1475
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,200
declaration

1476
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:43,599
the goal isn't to let the virus rip um

1477
00:51:43,599 --> 00:51:45,920
the goal is to protect the vulnerable

1478
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:49,119
to let society go as you know open

1479
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:50,960
schools and do other things that it

1480
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:52,480
functions as best it can in the midst of

1481
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:54,720
a terrible pandemic yes

1482
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:57,200
but not let the virus rip

1483
00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:58,880
where no the most vulnerable are

1484
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:00,400
protected the goal was to protect the

1485
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:02,880
vulnerable so why let it rip because it

1486
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:05,839
was a propaganda term to hit the fear

1487
00:52:05,839 --> 00:52:07,839
centers of people's brains oh these

1488
00:52:07,839 --> 00:52:09,520
people are immoral they just want to let

1489
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:11,119
the virus go through society and hurt

1490
00:52:11,119 --> 00:52:12,960
everybody that was that was that was the

1491
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:15,680
idea this it was a way to preclude a

1492
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:18,160
discussion and preclude a debate about

1493
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:19,920
the existing policy

1494
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:21,440
so i've uh

1495
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:24,319
this is an app called clubhouse

1496
00:52:24,319 --> 00:52:27,760
um i've gone back on it recently

1497
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:30,800
uh to practice russian unrelated for for

1498
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:32,559
a few big russian conversations coming

1499
00:52:32,559 --> 00:52:34,400
up anyway it's a great way to talk to

1500
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:36,400
regular people in russian but i also

1501
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:38,480
there was a i was i was nervous i was

1502
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:40,640
preparing for a pfizer ceo conversation

1503
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:42,800
and there was a vaccine room and so i

1504
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:44,720
joined it

1505
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:48,000
and there's a there's a pro science room

1506
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,920
as they they these are like scientists

1507
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:52,160
that were calling each other pro science

1508
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:54,880
it the whole thing was like theater to

1509
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:56,640
me i mean i haven't thoroughly

1510
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:58,079
researched but looking at the resume

1511
00:52:58,079 --> 00:52:59,440
they were like

1512
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:01,839
pretty solid um

1513
00:53:01,839 --> 00:53:04,000
researchers and doctors

1514
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,240
and they were mocking

1515
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:08,559
everybody

1516
00:53:08,559 --> 00:53:10,880
who was at all i mean it doesn't matter

1517
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:12,319
what they stood for but they were just

1518
00:53:12,319 --> 00:53:14,559
mocking people and the arrogance was

1519
00:53:14,559 --> 00:53:17,599
overwhelming i had to shut off

1520
00:53:17,599 --> 00:53:19,599
because i couldn't handle that human

1521
00:53:19,599 --> 00:53:21,440
beings can be like this to each other

1522
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:24,079
and then i i went back to just a double

1523
00:53:24,079 --> 00:53:26,240
check is this really how many people are

1524
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:29,839
here is this theater and then i uh asked

1525
00:53:29,839 --> 00:53:31,839
to come on stage on clubhouse to make a

1526
00:53:31,839 --> 00:53:34,079
couple comments and then as i open my

1527
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:36,079
mouth and say thank you so much you know

1528
00:53:36,079 --> 00:53:38,240
this is this is a great room sort of the

1529
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:40,319
usual civil politeness all that kind of

1530
00:53:40,319 --> 00:53:41,599
stuff

1531
00:53:41,599 --> 00:53:43,200
and

1532
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:45,839
i said i'm worried that

1533
00:53:45,839 --> 00:53:49,359
the kind of arrogance with which

1534
00:53:49,359 --> 00:53:51,520
things are being discussed here

1535
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:54,480
will further divide us not

1536
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:56,880
unite us and and before

1537
00:53:56,880 --> 00:54:00,400
i said even the united further divide us

1538
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:02,800
i was thrown off stage now this isn't

1539
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:05,599
why i mentioned platform but like i am

1540
00:54:05,599 --> 00:54:08,800
like uh lex friedman mit

1541
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:11,599
uh also which is something those people

1542
00:54:11,599 --> 00:54:13,440
seem to sometimes care about the

1543
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:16,480
followers and stuff like that like did

1544
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:18,960
you just do that and then they said

1545
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:21,040
enough of that nonsense

1546
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:25,280
enough of that nonsense they said to me

1547
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:27,359
enough of that nonsense

1548
00:54:27,359 --> 00:54:29,839
somebody who is obviously interviewed

1549
00:54:29,839 --> 00:54:31,520
francis collins

1550
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:35,040
is uh uh the pfizer ceo uh you're

1551
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:37,040
bringing a potential epidemiologist also

1552
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:39,520
so just yeah exactly but this broke my

1553
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:42,240
heart the arrogance and this is echoes

1554
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:43,680
of that arrogance is something you see

1555
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:46,160
in this email and i really would love to

1556
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:47,520
have a million things to talk about to

1557
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:49,760
try to figure out how can we find a path

1558
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:51,680
forward i think a lot of

1559
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:53,520
a lot of the problems

1560
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:55,599
we've seen in the

1561
00:54:55,599 --> 00:54:57,359
the discussion over cove especially in

1562
00:54:57,359 --> 00:54:58,960
the scientific community

1563
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:00,400
you know there's there's two ways to

1564
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:02,640
look at science i think uh that that

1565
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:04,240
have been competing with each other for

1566
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:06,240
a while now

1567
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:08,319
one way and this is the way that i view

1568
00:55:08,319 --> 00:55:09,839
science and why i've always found it so

1569
00:55:09,839 --> 00:55:10,880
attractive

1570
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:12,960
is an invitation to a structured

1571
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:14,160
discussion

1572
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:15,359
where

1573
00:55:15,359 --> 00:55:17,520
the the discussion is tempered by by

1574
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:20,640
evidence by data by by reasoning and

1575
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:21,680
logic

1576
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:23,839
right so it's a dialectical process

1577
00:55:23,839 --> 00:55:26,880
where if i believe a and you believe b

1578
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:30,000
well uh we talk about it we come up with

1579
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:31,680
an experiment that distinguishes between

1580
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:34,160
the two and while you know b turns out

1581
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:36,160
to be right i'm i'm all frustrated but i

1582
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:38,480
buy you dinner and i say no no no c and

1583
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:40,799
then we go on from there right that's

1584
00:55:40,799 --> 00:55:43,440
that's what science is at its best it's

1585
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:46,319
this process of using data in discussion

1586
00:55:46,319 --> 00:55:49,440
it's a human activity right uh to to to

1587
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:50,559
learn

1588
00:55:50,559 --> 00:55:52,720
to let have the truth unfold itself

1589
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:54,079
before us

1590
00:55:54,079 --> 00:55:56,480
on the other hand there are

1591
00:55:56,480 --> 00:55:57,839
there's another way that people have

1592
00:55:57,839 --> 00:56:00,000
used science or thought about science as

1593
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:03,040
a as truth in and of itself

1594
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:04,799
right this like if it's if it's science

1595
00:56:04,799 --> 00:56:07,040
therefore it's true automatically and

1596
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:08,079
they're

1597
00:56:08,079 --> 00:56:10,079
you know what does the science say to do

1598
00:56:10,079 --> 00:56:11,680
well the science never says to do

1599
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:13,359
anything the science says here's what's

1600
00:56:13,359 --> 00:56:14,960
true and then we have to

1601
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:17,200
apply our human values

1602
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:20,640
to say okay well if we do this well then

1603
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:22,079
this is likely to happen that's what the

1604
00:56:22,079 --> 00:56:24,240
science says if we do that then that is

1605
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:25,839
likely to happen well we'd rather have

1606
00:56:25,839 --> 00:56:28,400
this than that right and but it doesn't

1607
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:29,760
science doesn't tell us that we'd rather

1608
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:30,799
have this than that is there human

1609
00:56:30,799 --> 00:56:32,079
values that tell us that we'd rather

1610
00:56:32,079 --> 00:56:33,920
this and that science plays a role but

1611
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:35,599
it's not the only thing

1612
00:56:35,599 --> 00:56:37,760
uh it's not the only role it's like it

1613
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:39,440
helps us understand the constraints we

1614
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:41,520
face but it doesn't tell us what to do

1615
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:43,119
in face of those constraints

1616
00:56:43,119 --> 00:56:45,200
but underneath it at the individual

1617
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:46,960
level at the institutional level it

1618
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:48,720
seems like

1619
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:49,599
um

1620
00:56:49,599 --> 00:56:51,200
arrogance

1621
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:53,440
is really destructive so the flip side

1622
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:55,680
of that the productive thing is humility

1623
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:58,799
so sort of um

1624
00:56:58,799 --> 00:57:01,119
always not being

1625
00:57:01,119 --> 00:57:02,880
sure that you're right

1626
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:04,960
this is actually kind of uh

1627
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:07,200
stuart russell talks about this for ai

1628
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:09,359
research how do you make sure that ai

1629
00:57:09,359 --> 00:57:11,200
super intelligent ai doesn't destroy us

1630
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:13,599
you built in um

1631
00:57:13,599 --> 00:57:15,599
a sort of module within it that it

1632
00:57:15,599 --> 00:57:17,520
always doubts

1633
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:19,920
its actions like it's not sure

1634
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:21,920
like i know it says i'm supposed to

1635
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:24,720
destroy all humans but maybe i'm wrong

1636
00:57:24,720 --> 00:57:26,960
and that maybe i'm wrong is essential

1637
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:29,040
for progress for actually doing in the

1638
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:31,119
long arc of history better not the

1639
00:57:31,119 --> 00:57:32,480
perfect thing but better and better and

1640
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:34,000
better and better i mean the the

1641
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,559
question i have here for you is

1642
00:57:36,559 --> 00:57:37,920
this

1643
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:41,119
this email so clearly captures some

1644
00:57:41,119 --> 00:57:43,200
maybe echo but maybe a core to the

1645
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:45,839
problem do you put responsibility of

1646
00:57:45,839 --> 00:57:48,880
this email of the shortcomings

1647
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:51,040
and failures on individuals or

1648
00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:53,520
institutions

1649
00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:55,040
no this is an institutional failure

1650
00:57:55,040 --> 00:57:58,079
right so um the nih i so i've had two

1651
00:57:58,079 --> 00:57:59,920
decades of nih funding i've sat on nih

1652
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:02,480
review panels the purpose of the nih is

1653
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:04,160
what you said earlier lex the purpose of

1654
00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:07,920
nih is to support the work of scientists

1655
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:10,000
to some extent it's also how to help

1656
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,160
scientists to direct scientists to work

1657
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:13,680
on things that are very important for

1658
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:15,359
public health or for the health of the

1659
00:58:15,359 --> 00:58:16,559
public

1660
00:58:16,559 --> 00:58:18,559
um so and the way you do that is you say

1661
00:58:18,559 --> 00:58:20,000
okay we're gonna put

1662
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,240
you know 50 million dollars on uh the

1663
00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:24,160
research in alzheimer's disease this

1664
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:26,000
year or 70 million dollars on hiv or

1665
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,240
whatever it is right some and uh that

1666
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:30,720
pot of money then uh scientists compete

1667
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:32,880
with each other for the best ideas to to

1668
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:36,240
use it to address that that problem so

1669
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:38,799
it's essentially an endeavor to support

1670
00:58:38,799 --> 00:58:41,599
the work of scientists it is not in and

1671
00:58:41,599 --> 00:58:44,960
of itself a policy organ

1672
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:47,440
it doesn't say what public health policy

1673
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:48,960
should be

1674
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:52,240
for that you have the cdc

1675
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:53,200
and

1676
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:55,440
what happened during the pandemic is

1677
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:56,400
that

1678
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:57,440
people

1679
00:58:57,440 --> 00:59:00,160
in the nih were called upon

1680
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:04,799
to contribute to public health making

1681
00:59:04,799 --> 00:59:06,480
and that created the conflict of

1682
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:08,720
interest you see in that email

1683
00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:11,599
right so now you have the head of the

1684
00:59:11,599 --> 00:59:12,799
nih

1685
00:59:12,799 --> 00:59:15,119
in effect saying to all scientists you

1686
00:59:15,119 --> 00:59:16,960
must agree with me

1687
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:20,799
in the policies that i've recommended

1688
00:59:20,799 --> 00:59:23,520
or else you're fringe

1689
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:25,359
that is a deep conflict of interest it's

1690
00:59:25,359 --> 00:59:27,520
deep because first he he's conflicted he

1691
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:29,359
has this dual role as

1692
00:59:29,359 --> 00:59:31,520
as as the head of the nih

1693
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:33,280
supporter of scientific funding and then

1694
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:34,480
also

1695
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:36,799
inappropriately called to set or help

1696
00:59:36,799 --> 00:59:37,760
set

1697
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:39,359
pandemic policy

1698
00:59:39,359 --> 00:59:40,880
that should never have happened there

1699
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:43,520
should be a bright line between those

1700
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:45,359
two roles

1701
00:59:45,359 --> 00:59:46,720
let me ask you about just francis

1702
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:48,480
collins i don't know if you i i had a

1703
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:49,760
chance to talk to him on a podcast i

1704
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:51,359
don't know if you maybe by chance gotten

1705
00:59:51,359 --> 00:59:53,839
a chance to hear a few words of it

1706
00:59:53,839 --> 00:59:56,240
um well i have a kind of a question uh

1707
00:59:56,240 --> 00:59:59,440
to that because a lot of people

1708
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:01,520
wrote to me quite negative things about

1709
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:03,599
francis collins and like i said i still

1710
01:00:03,599 --> 01:00:04,880
believe

1711
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:07,599
he's a great man a great scientist

1712
01:00:07,599 --> 01:00:09,280
um

1713
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:10,880
one of the things when i

1714
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:13,359
talked to him off mike

1715
01:00:13,359 --> 01:00:16,400
about the vaccine

1716
01:00:16,799 --> 01:00:19,839
the excitement he had about when we were

1717
01:00:19,839 --> 01:00:22,960
recollecting when they first got an

1718
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:24,720
inkling that it's actually going to be

1719
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:26,799
possible to get a vaccine

1720
01:00:26,799 --> 01:00:29,440
just he wasn't messaging just in the

1721
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:31,359
private or of our own conversation he

1722
01:00:31,359 --> 01:00:33,359
was really excited and why was he

1723
01:00:33,359 --> 01:00:35,599
excited because he gets to help a lot of

1724
01:00:35,599 --> 01:00:37,920
people this is a man

1725
01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:41,040
that really wants to help people and

1726
01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:42,720
there could be some institutional

1727
01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:44,400
self-delusion the arrogance all those

1728
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:46,559
kinds of things that lead to this kind

1729
01:00:46,559 --> 01:00:48,799
of email but ultimately the the goal is

1730
01:00:48,799 --> 01:00:50,400
this is what i don't think people quite

1731
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:51,680
realize this

1732
01:00:51,680 --> 01:00:53,599
the reason you call your fringe

1733
01:00:53,599 --> 01:00:56,079
epidemiologist the reason there needs to

1734
01:00:56,079 --> 01:00:58,960
be a devastating uh published takedown

1735
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:01,839
he i believe really believes

1736
01:01:01,839 --> 01:01:05,040
that this it could be very dangerous

1737
01:01:05,040 --> 01:01:06,480
yeah and

1738
01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:08,720
it's a lot of burden to carry on his

1739
01:01:08,720 --> 01:01:10,720
shoulders because like you said in his

1740
01:01:10,720 --> 01:01:12,559
role where he defines some of the public

1741
01:01:12,559 --> 01:01:14,319
policy

1742
01:01:14,319 --> 01:01:15,359
like

1743
01:01:15,359 --> 01:01:17,680
you know depending on how he thinks

1744
01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:18,960
about the world

1745
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:20,720
millions of people could die because of

1746
01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:23,200
one decision he make yeah and that's a

1747
01:01:23,200 --> 01:01:25,280
lot of burden to walk with yeah no i

1748
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:26,960
think that's right i don't think that he

1749
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:29,280
has bad intentions

1750
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:30,720
i think that he was

1751
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:33,040
basically put was put or maybe put

1752
01:01:33,040 --> 01:01:36,240
himself in a position where

1753
01:01:36,240 --> 01:01:38,079
this kind of conflict of interest was

1754
01:01:38,079 --> 01:01:40,319
going to create this kind of this this

1755
01:01:40,319 --> 01:01:42,319
kind of a reaction

1756
01:01:42,319 --> 01:01:43,760
right the kind of humility that you're

1757
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:45,599
calling for is almost impossible when

1758
01:01:45,599 --> 01:01:48,240
you have that dual dual role this that

1759
01:01:48,240 --> 01:01:50,319
shouldn't you shouldn't have to have as

1760
01:01:50,319 --> 01:01:52,400
as funder of science and also center of

1761
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:53,760
scientific policy i agree with

1762
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:55,039
everything you just said except the last

1763
01:01:55,039 --> 01:01:57,359
part the the humility is almost

1764
01:01:57,359 --> 01:01:59,280
impossible that

1765
01:01:59,280 --> 01:02:00,000
uh

1766
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,559
humility is always difficult i think

1767
01:02:02,559 --> 01:02:04,880
i think there's a huge incentive to for

1768
01:02:04,880 --> 01:02:06,480
humility in that position

1769
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:08,559
now look at history

1770
01:02:08,559 --> 01:02:12,799
great leaders that have humility

1771
01:02:12,799 --> 01:02:14,400
are popular as hell

1772
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:16,640
so if you like being popular

1773
01:02:16,640 --> 01:02:19,520
if you like having impact legacy

1774
01:02:19,520 --> 01:02:21,359
these descendants of apes seem to care

1775
01:02:21,359 --> 01:02:23,200
about legacy especially as they get

1776
01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:26,319
older in these high positions like i i

1777
01:02:26,319 --> 01:02:27,680
think the incentive for humility is

1778
01:02:27,680 --> 01:02:29,200
pretty high well i mean the thing is is

1779
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:30,960
like there's a lot that he has to be

1780
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:32,960
proud of in his career i mean like the

1781
01:02:32,960 --> 01:02:34,400
human genome project

1782
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:36,160
wouldn't have happened without him uh

1783
01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:38,319
and he is he is a great man and a great

1784
01:02:38,319 --> 01:02:41,039
scientist but so it is tragic to me that

1785
01:02:41,039 --> 01:02:42,720
his career has ended in this particular

1786
01:02:42,720 --> 01:02:44,559
way

1787
01:02:44,559 --> 01:02:47,760
he asked you a question about um

1788
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:50,559
my podcast conversation with them

1789
01:02:50,559 --> 01:02:54,319
by way of advice or maybe criticism

1790
01:02:54,319 --> 01:02:56,240
there's a lot of people that wrote to me

1791
01:02:56,240 --> 01:02:58,160
kind words of support

1792
01:02:58,160 --> 01:02:59,119
and

1793
01:02:59,119 --> 01:03:00,720
a lot of people that wrote to me

1794
01:03:00,720 --> 01:03:03,280
respectful constructive criticism

1795
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:05,280
how would you suggest to have

1796
01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:07,760
conversations with folks like that

1797
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:08,720
and

1798
01:03:08,720 --> 01:03:11,520
maybe um i mean because there's i have

1799
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:13,280
other conversations like this including

1800
01:03:13,280 --> 01:03:16,000
i was debating whether to talk to

1801
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:19,119
anthony fauci he wanted to talk

1802
01:03:19,119 --> 01:03:20,720
and so

1803
01:03:20,720 --> 01:03:22,640
what kind of conversation do you have

1804
01:03:22,640 --> 01:03:24,640
and sorry to take us on a tangent but

1805
01:03:24,640 --> 01:03:26,319
almost from an interview

1806
01:03:26,319 --> 01:03:29,119
perspective of how to inspire humility

1807
01:03:29,119 --> 01:03:31,039
and inspire trust

1808
01:03:31,039 --> 01:03:33,200
in science or maybe give hope that we

1809
01:03:33,200 --> 01:03:34,559
know what the heck we're doing and we're

1810
01:03:34,559 --> 01:03:37,200
going to figure this out i mean i think

1811
01:03:37,200 --> 01:03:38,319
you're

1812
01:03:38,319 --> 01:03:40,240
i've been now interviewed by many people

1813
01:03:40,240 --> 01:03:41,039
um

1814
01:03:41,039 --> 01:03:42,640
i think uh

1815
01:03:42,640 --> 01:03:44,400
the style you have really works well lex

1816
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:46,000
you have to you because you i don't

1817
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
think you're going to be ever an attack

1818
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:48,880
dog

1819
01:03:48,880 --> 01:03:50,880
trying to go after somebody and and

1820
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:52,880
force them to to like

1821
01:03:52,880 --> 01:03:54,319
you know admit that they were wrong

1822
01:03:54,319 --> 01:03:56,240
about or whatever about i mean that's

1823
01:03:56,240 --> 01:03:57,839
that i also actually find that form of

1824
01:03:57,839 --> 01:03:59,839
journalism and podcasting really

1825
01:03:59,839 --> 01:04:02,000
off-putting it's hard to watch

1826
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,079
also it's a whole lot of the tangent is

1827
01:04:04,079 --> 01:04:06,000
that actually effective i don't think so

1828
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,000
do you want to ask

1829
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:09,039
hitler

1830
01:04:09,039 --> 01:04:10,319
and i think about this a lot actually

1831
01:04:10,319 --> 01:04:11,520
interviewing hitler i've been studying a

1832
01:04:11,520 --> 01:04:13,440
lot about the the the rise and the fall

1833
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:14,960
of the third reich

1834
01:04:14,960 --> 01:04:16,799
i think about interviewing stalin like i

1835
01:04:16,799 --> 01:04:19,520
put myself in that mindset like how do

1836
01:04:19,520 --> 01:04:20,559
you

1837
01:04:20,559 --> 01:04:22,720
have conversations with people to

1838
01:04:22,720 --> 01:04:25,359
understand who they are so that not so

1839
01:04:25,359 --> 01:04:28,000
you can sit there and yell at them yeah

1840
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:29,520
but to understand who they are so that

1841
01:04:29,520 --> 01:04:31,680
you can inspire a very large number of

1842
01:04:31,680 --> 01:04:33,280
people to be the best version of

1843
01:04:33,280 --> 01:04:35,599
themselves and to avoid the mistakes of

1844
01:04:35,599 --> 01:04:38,319
the past i believe that everyone

1845
01:04:38,319 --> 01:04:40,079
that's involved in this debate has good

1846
01:04:40,079 --> 01:04:42,240
intentions they have they're coming at

1847
01:04:42,240 --> 01:04:44,160
it from their points of view uh they

1848
01:04:44,160 --> 01:04:46,319
they don't they have um

1849
01:04:46,319 --> 01:04:48,079
uh they have their weaknesses

1850
01:04:48,079 --> 01:04:50,079
and if you can paint a picture in your

1851
01:04:50,079 --> 01:04:52,720
questioning by sympathetic questioning

1852
01:04:52,720 --> 01:04:55,200
of those strengths and weaknesses and

1853
01:04:55,200 --> 01:04:56,319
their point of view you've done a

1854
01:04:56,319 --> 01:04:58,799
service um that's really all you i

1855
01:04:58,799 --> 01:05:00,640
personally like like to see in those

1856
01:05:00,640 --> 01:05:02,799
kinds of interviews um i don't think a

1857
01:05:02,799 --> 01:05:04,559
gotcha moment

1858
01:05:04,559 --> 01:05:06,720
uh is really the key thing there the the

1859
01:05:06,720 --> 01:05:08,240
key thing is understanding where they're

1860
01:05:08,240 --> 01:05:10,559
coming from understanding their thinking

1861
01:05:10,559 --> 01:05:12,240
understanding the constraints they faced

1862
01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:14,319
and how did they manage them that's

1863
01:05:14,319 --> 01:05:16,240
going to provide a much i mean for me

1864
01:05:16,240 --> 01:05:17,520
that's what i look for when i when i

1865
01:05:17,520 --> 01:05:19,440
listen to podcasts like yours

1866
01:05:19,440 --> 01:05:21,440
um is is an understanding of that of

1867
01:05:21,440 --> 01:05:23,280
that of that person

1868
01:05:23,280 --> 01:05:25,359
and the moment and how they dealt with

1869
01:05:25,359 --> 01:05:26,160
it

1870
01:05:26,160 --> 01:05:28,319
i mean i guess the hope is

1871
01:05:28,319 --> 01:05:31,200
to discover in a sympathetic way a flaw

1872
01:05:31,200 --> 01:05:33,760
in a person's thinking together

1873
01:05:33,760 --> 01:05:34,799
like

1874
01:05:34,799 --> 01:05:36,400
as opposed to discovering the positive

1875
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:38,400
thing together you discover

1876
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:40,240
the thing well i didn't really think

1877
01:05:40,240 --> 01:05:41,520
about that yeah i mean that's what

1878
01:05:41,520 --> 01:05:43,359
that's how science is right that's why

1879
01:05:43,359 --> 01:05:44,640
we found it i think find it so

1880
01:05:44,640 --> 01:05:48,480
attractive is this i i i like it when a

1881
01:05:48,480 --> 01:05:50,160
student shows me i'm thinking

1882
01:05:50,160 --> 01:05:51,440
incorrectly

1883
01:05:51,440 --> 01:05:53,280
right i think i'm really grateful to

1884
01:05:53,280 --> 01:05:55,359
that student because now i have an

1885
01:05:55,359 --> 01:05:57,119
opportunity to change my mind about it

1886
01:05:57,119 --> 01:05:58,400
and then start thinking even more

1887
01:05:58,400 --> 01:06:00,000
correctly i mean that's

1888
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,319
and there are moments when

1889
01:06:02,319 --> 01:06:04,400
uh i mean like this is probably a good

1890
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:05,839
time to say like what i think i got

1891
01:06:05,839 --> 01:06:06,720
wrong

1892
01:06:06,720 --> 01:06:08,240
during the pandemic right so like for

1893
01:06:08,240 --> 01:06:10,160
instance you said francis collins had a

1894
01:06:10,160 --> 01:06:13,200
moment when uh he learned that that

1895
01:06:13,200 --> 01:06:14,960
there was quite possible to get a

1896
01:06:14,960 --> 01:06:17,119
vaccine going yeah he must have learned

1897
01:06:17,119 --> 01:06:18,960
that quite early

1898
01:06:18,960 --> 01:06:21,359
and i didn't learn that early

1899
01:06:21,359 --> 01:06:23,520
i mean i i didn't know

1900
01:06:23,520 --> 01:06:25,760
in march of 2020

1901
01:06:25,760 --> 01:06:27,440
in my experience with vaccine

1902
01:06:27,440 --> 01:06:29,280
development it would have take i thought

1903
01:06:29,280 --> 01:06:30,960
it would take a decade or more to get a

1904
01:06:30,960 --> 01:06:32,960
vaccine

1905
01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:35,280
that was wrong right i didn't that that

1906
01:06:35,280 --> 01:06:38,480
and and i was so happy when i started to

1907
01:06:38,480 --> 01:06:40,319
see the preliminary numbers

1908
01:06:40,319 --> 01:06:42,319
in the in the pfizer trial

1909
01:06:42,319 --> 01:06:44,319
that strongly suggested it was going to

1910
01:06:44,319 --> 01:06:46,240
work

1911
01:06:46,240 --> 01:06:48,319
yeah and at the i was

1912
01:06:48,319 --> 01:06:49,520
i mean like very few times in my life

1913
01:06:49,520 --> 01:06:51,839
i'm so happy to be wrong

1914
01:06:51,839 --> 01:06:53,839
and it changes kind of

1915
01:06:53,839 --> 01:06:55,760
um i think i've heard you mention that

1916
01:06:55,760 --> 01:06:58,400
lockdown is still a bad idea

1917
01:06:58,400 --> 01:07:00,240
unless the vaccine comes out in like

1918
01:07:00,240 --> 01:07:01,359
tomorrow

1919
01:07:01,359 --> 01:07:03,839
uh there's still like

1920
01:07:03,839 --> 01:07:05,680
suffering and economic pain all kinds of

1921
01:07:05,680 --> 01:07:08,319
pain can still happen in even just a a

1922
01:07:08,319 --> 01:07:09,760
scale of weeks

1923
01:07:09,760 --> 01:07:11,680
um

1924
01:07:11,680 --> 01:07:13,119
versus months

1925
01:07:13,119 --> 01:07:16,240
yeah well let's talk about the vaccine

1926
01:07:16,240 --> 01:07:18,240
what are your thoughts on the safety and

1927
01:07:18,240 --> 01:07:20,559
efficacy of covered vaccines at the

1928
01:07:20,559 --> 01:07:23,440
individual and the societal level so for

1929
01:07:23,440 --> 01:07:26,160
the the vaccine safety data

1930
01:07:26,160 --> 01:07:28,640
it's it's actually challenging

1931
01:07:28,640 --> 01:07:30,640
to convey to the public how this is

1932
01:07:30,640 --> 01:07:32,400
normally done like normally you would do

1933
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:34,480
this in the context of the trial you'd

1934
01:07:34,480 --> 01:07:36,319
have a law a long trial with large

1935
01:07:36,319 --> 01:07:37,839
numbers relatively large numbers of

1936
01:07:37,839 --> 01:07:39,680
people you'd follow them over a long

1937
01:07:39,680 --> 01:07:41,039
time and the trial will give you some

1938
01:07:41,039 --> 01:07:43,680
indication of the safety of the vaccine

1939
01:07:43,680 --> 01:07:46,240
and it did um i mean but

1940
01:07:46,240 --> 01:07:48,400
you the the the trial the way it was

1941
01:07:48,400 --> 01:07:49,599
constructed

1942
01:07:49,599 --> 01:07:51,520
when it was came out that it was

1943
01:07:51,520 --> 01:07:53,039
protective against covet it was no

1944
01:07:53,039 --> 01:07:56,240
longer ethical to have a placebo arm

1945
01:07:56,240 --> 01:07:57,920
and so that placebo arm is vaccinated

1946
01:07:57,920 --> 01:08:00,079
what large part of it

1947
01:08:00,079 --> 01:08:02,160
and so that meant that from the trial

1948
01:08:02,160 --> 01:08:04,640
you are not going to be able to get

1949
01:08:04,640 --> 01:08:06,960
data on the long-term safety profiles of

1950
01:08:06,960 --> 01:08:08,960
the vaccine

1951
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:10,640
uh and also the other thing about trials

1952
01:08:10,640 --> 01:08:12,240
although there's tens of thousands of

1953
01:08:12,240 --> 01:08:13,920
people enrolled that's still not enough

1954
01:08:13,920 --> 01:08:16,238
to get when you when it when you deploy

1955
01:08:16,238 --> 01:08:18,960
a vaccine to the population scale you're

1956
01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:20,158
going to see things that weren't in the

1957
01:08:20,158 --> 01:08:21,120
trial

1958
01:08:21,120 --> 01:08:22,880
guaranteed

1959
01:08:22,880 --> 01:08:24,000
populations of people that weren't

1960
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:25,839
represented well in the trial are going

1961
01:08:25,839 --> 01:08:27,920
to are going to be given the vaccine and

1962
01:08:27,920 --> 01:08:29,279
then that they're going to have things

1963
01:08:29,279 --> 01:08:30,560
that happen to them that you didn't

1964
01:08:30,560 --> 01:08:32,238
didn't anticipate

1965
01:08:32,238 --> 01:08:33,359
so

1966
01:08:33,359 --> 01:08:35,198
i wasn't surprised when people were a

1967
01:08:35,198 --> 01:08:37,040
little bit skeptical when the trial was

1968
01:08:37,040 --> 01:08:38,880
done about the safety profile just the

1969
01:08:38,880 --> 01:08:40,238
way the nature of the thing was going to

1970
01:08:40,238 --> 01:08:42,080
make it so that it was going to be hard

1971
01:08:42,080 --> 01:08:43,839
to get a complete picture from the

1972
01:08:43,839 --> 01:08:46,080
trials itself and the trials showed they

1973
01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:47,520
were pretty safe

1974
01:08:47,520 --> 01:08:50,719
and quite effective at preventing

1975
01:08:50,719 --> 01:08:52,960
both you from getting covid actually i

1976
01:08:52,960 --> 01:08:54,479
think the main endpoint of the trial

1977
01:08:54,479 --> 01:08:57,520
itself was a symptomatic covet

1978
01:08:57,520 --> 01:09:00,960
right so um uh so that was like that was

1979
01:09:00,960 --> 01:09:03,198
you know i mean it was really um

1980
01:09:03,198 --> 01:09:05,600
to me like is about as amazing

1981
01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:07,120
achievement as anything organizing a

1982
01:09:07,120 --> 01:09:09,520
trial of that scale and running it so

1983
01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:10,640
quickly

1984
01:09:10,640 --> 01:09:12,960
and the final results being so

1985
01:09:12,960 --> 01:09:15,920
surprisingly high so good right

1986
01:09:15,920 --> 01:09:17,439
and um so

1987
01:09:17,439 --> 01:09:20,719
the but the problem then was normally it

1988
01:09:20,719 --> 01:09:24,080
would take a long time the fda would

1989
01:09:24,080 --> 01:09:25,920
tell pfizer to go back and try it in

1990
01:09:25,920 --> 01:09:28,479
this subgroup they'd work more on dosing

1991
01:09:28,479 --> 01:09:30,960
they'd do all these kinds of things

1992
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:32,560
that kind of didn't we really didn't

1993
01:09:32,560 --> 01:09:33,679
have time for in the middle of a

1994
01:09:33,679 --> 01:09:36,479
pandemic right so you have a you have

1995
01:09:36,479 --> 01:09:40,399
a basis for approval that it's less

1996
01:09:40,399 --> 01:09:42,560
full than normally you would have for a

1997
01:09:42,560 --> 01:09:45,120
population scale vaccine

1998
01:09:45,120 --> 01:09:46,960
but the results were good results looked

1999
01:09:46,960 --> 01:09:48,640
really good and actually i should say

2000
01:09:48,640 --> 01:09:51,120
for the most part that's been borne out

2001
01:09:51,120 --> 01:09:53,040
when we've given the vaccine at scale in

2002
01:09:53,040 --> 01:09:54,719
terms of protection against severe

2003
01:09:54,719 --> 01:09:55,840
disease

2004
01:09:55,840 --> 01:09:57,600
yeah all right so people who have got

2005
01:09:57,600 --> 01:09:58,880
the vaccine

2006
01:09:58,880 --> 01:10:00,719
um for a very long time after they've

2007
01:10:00,719 --> 01:10:02,800
had that for the full vaccination have

2008
01:10:02,800 --> 01:10:05,840
had great protection against going being

2009
01:10:05,840 --> 01:10:07,600
hospitalized and dying if they get

2010
01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:10,320
covered let's separate because this

2011
01:10:10,320 --> 01:10:11,920
seems to be

2012
01:10:11,920 --> 01:10:12,800
um

2013
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:14,880
there's critics of both categories but

2014
01:10:14,880 --> 01:10:17,120
different kids

2015
01:10:17,120 --> 01:10:17,920
and

2016
01:10:17,920 --> 01:10:19,520
kids and

2017
01:10:19,520 --> 01:10:21,840
old not older people like uh

2018
01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:23,840
let's say five years old and above or

2019
01:10:23,840 --> 01:10:25,280
something like they're 13 years old and

2020
01:10:25,280 --> 01:10:27,679
above so

2021
01:10:27,679 --> 01:10:31,440
for those it seems like the reduction

2022
01:10:31,440 --> 01:10:34,480
of uh the rate of fatalities and and

2023
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:36,719
serious illness seems to be something

2024
01:10:36,719 --> 01:10:38,080
like 10x

2025
01:10:38,080 --> 01:10:41,120
i mean for older people it is a godsend

2026
01:10:41,120 --> 01:10:44,719
this vaccine it it transforms the the

2027
01:10:44,719 --> 01:10:47,120
problem of focus protection from

2028
01:10:47,120 --> 01:10:49,120
something that's quite challenging

2029
01:10:49,120 --> 01:10:50,719
possible i believe but quite challenging

2030
01:10:50,719 --> 01:10:52,000
to something that's much much more

2031
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,400
manageable because the vaccine in and of

2032
01:10:54,400 --> 01:10:56,480
itself when deployed in older

2033
01:10:56,480 --> 01:10:58,080
populations is a form of focus

2034
01:10:58,080 --> 01:11:00,000
protection

2035
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,239
yes well by the way we'll talk about the

2036
01:11:02,239 --> 01:11:04,320
focus protection in one segment because

2037
01:11:04,320 --> 01:11:06,000
it's such a brilliant idea for this

2038
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,719
pandemic of future pandemics i thought

2039
01:11:08,719 --> 01:11:10,640
the sociological psychological

2040
01:11:10,640 --> 01:11:13,040
discussion about the letter from francis

2041
01:11:13,040 --> 01:11:15,120
collins is um

2042
01:11:15,120 --> 01:11:16,640
because it was so recent it was been so

2043
01:11:16,640 --> 01:11:18,320
troubling to me so i'm glad we talked

2044
01:11:18,320 --> 01:11:20,080
about that first

2045
01:11:20,080 --> 01:11:23,280
but so the there seems to be

2046
01:11:23,280 --> 01:11:27,199
the vaccines work to reduce deaths

2047
01:11:27,199 --> 01:11:29,679
and that has especially the most

2048
01:11:29,679 --> 01:11:32,320
transformative effects for the older so

2049
01:11:32,320 --> 01:11:33,760
can i let you give i've told you one

2050
01:11:33,760 --> 01:11:35,040
thing that i got wrong in the panic let

2051
01:11:35,040 --> 01:11:36,400
me tell you the second thing i got wrong

2052
01:11:36,400 --> 01:11:38,159
for sure in the pandemic

2053
01:11:38,159 --> 01:11:41,760
in january of la of this year

2054
01:11:41,760 --> 01:11:45,280
2021 i thought that the vaccines would

2055
01:11:45,280 --> 01:11:47,920
stop infection

2056
01:11:47,920 --> 01:11:50,239
yes right it would would make it so that

2057
01:11:50,239 --> 01:11:52,480
you were much less likely to be infected

2058
01:11:52,480 --> 01:11:53,440
at all

2059
01:11:53,440 --> 01:11:55,360
because the the antibodies that were

2060
01:11:55,360 --> 01:11:56,640
produced by the vaccines looked like

2061
01:11:56,640 --> 01:11:58,239
they were neutralizing antibodies that

2062
01:11:58,239 --> 01:11:59,840
would would essentially block you from

2063
01:11:59,840 --> 01:12:02,800
being infected at all

2064
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:03,840
um

2065
01:12:03,840 --> 01:12:05,840
that turned out to be wrong

2066
01:12:05,840 --> 01:12:09,120
right so i think it became clear

2067
01:12:09,120 --> 01:12:11,280
as data came out from israel which

2068
01:12:11,280 --> 01:12:12,880
vaccinated very early that they were

2069
01:12:12,880 --> 01:12:15,280
seeing surges of infection even in a

2070
01:12:15,280 --> 01:12:17,840
very highly vaccinated population

2071
01:12:17,840 --> 01:12:18,800
that

2072
01:12:18,800 --> 01:12:21,679
that the vaccine does not stop infection

2073
01:12:21,679 --> 01:12:24,400
so you're a used car salesman and you're

2074
01:12:24,400 --> 01:12:26,080
selling the vaccine

2075
01:12:26,080 --> 01:12:28,000
and the features you thought of vaccine

2076
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:29,440
would have i mean i have a similar kind

2077
01:12:29,440 --> 01:12:31,600
of sense when the vaccine came out

2078
01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:33,520
vaccine would

2079
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:35,280
reduce

2080
01:12:35,280 --> 01:12:37,520
if you somehow were able to get it you

2081
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:39,199
would reduce rate of death and all those

2082
01:12:39,199 --> 01:12:41,840
kinds of things but it would also reduce

2083
01:12:41,840 --> 01:12:43,199
the chance of you

2084
01:12:43,199 --> 01:12:45,760
getting it and if you do get it the

2085
01:12:45,760 --> 01:12:47,360
chance that you transmitting it to

2086
01:12:47,360 --> 01:12:48,800
somebody else

2087
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:51,760
and it turns out that those latter two

2088
01:12:51,760 --> 01:12:54,800
things are not as uh definitive or in

2089
01:12:54,800 --> 01:12:56,400
fact they're i mean i don't know to

2090
01:12:56,400 --> 01:12:58,000
which agree they're not i mean i think

2091
01:12:58,000 --> 01:12:59,360
it's it's a little complicated because i

2092
01:12:59,360 --> 01:13:01,440
think the first two or three months

2093
01:13:01,440 --> 01:13:02,719
after you're fully vaccinated after the

2094
01:13:02,719 --> 01:13:06,320
second dose you have

2095
01:13:06,320 --> 01:13:08,880
60 70 percent efficacy peak against

2096
01:13:08,880 --> 01:13:11,360
infection yeah so uh that which is

2097
01:13:11,360 --> 01:13:13,600
pretty good i mean right but by

2098
01:13:13,600 --> 01:13:16,000
six seven eight months that drops to 20

2099
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,480
percent some places some studies like

2100
01:13:18,480 --> 01:13:19,920
there's a study out of sweden suggested

2101
01:13:19,920 --> 01:13:22,000
it might even drop to zero but and then

2102
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:23,840
you're also infectious for some period

2103
01:13:23,840 --> 01:13:25,920
of time if you do get it even though

2104
01:13:25,920 --> 01:13:27,760
you're vaccinated correct although there

2105
01:13:27,760 --> 01:13:28,960
seems to be

2106
01:13:28,960 --> 01:13:30,800
lucy data that the period of time your

2107
01:13:30,800 --> 01:13:32,960
infectious is short it's shorter but the

2108
01:13:32,960 --> 01:13:36,400
the infectivity per day is about as high

2109
01:13:36,400 --> 01:13:38,719
so you still it's the point is that that

2110
01:13:38,719 --> 01:13:40,960
the vaccine might reduce some risk of

2111
01:13:40,960 --> 01:13:42,400
infecting others but it's not a

2112
01:13:42,400 --> 01:13:44,719
categorical difference

2113
01:13:44,719 --> 01:13:48,960
so uh a unvaccine it's not safe to be in

2114
01:13:48,960 --> 01:13:51,120
the presence of just vaccinated people

2115
01:13:51,120 --> 01:13:53,760
you can still get infected

2116
01:13:53,760 --> 01:13:56,080
right so i mean there's a million things

2117
01:13:56,080 --> 01:13:58,400
i want to ask here but

2118
01:13:58,400 --> 01:14:00,239
is there in some sense because the

2119
01:14:00,239 --> 01:14:01,600
vaccine

2120
01:14:01,600 --> 01:14:02,880
um

2121
01:14:02,880 --> 01:14:05,440
really helps on the worst

2122
01:14:05,440 --> 01:14:07,600
part of this pandemic which is killing

2123
01:14:07,600 --> 01:14:09,520
people yes

2124
01:14:09,520 --> 01:14:11,360
uh doesn't that mean

2125
01:14:11,360 --> 01:14:14,480
uh where does the vaccine hesitancy come

2126
01:14:14,480 --> 01:14:15,520
from

2127
01:14:15,520 --> 01:14:18,239
in terms of it seems like obviously a

2128
01:14:18,239 --> 01:14:21,199
vaccine is a powerful solution to let us

2129
01:14:21,199 --> 01:14:23,360
open this thing up yeah so i wrote a

2130
01:14:23,360 --> 01:14:24,960
wall street journal op-ed with sinatra

2131
01:14:24,960 --> 01:14:27,679
gupta in december of last year yes a

2132
01:14:27,679 --> 01:14:29,840
very night with a very naive title which

2133
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:32,239
says we can end the lockdowns in a month

2134
01:14:32,239 --> 01:14:33,840
and the idea is very simple

2135
01:14:33,840 --> 01:14:35,120
vaccinate

2136
01:14:35,120 --> 01:14:36,560
all

2137
01:14:36,560 --> 01:14:39,120
vulnerable people

2138
01:14:39,120 --> 01:14:40,080
and then

2139
01:14:40,080 --> 01:14:42,400
open up open up right uh and the idea

2140
01:14:42,400 --> 01:14:44,640
was that uh the the lockdown harms this

2141
01:14:44,640 --> 01:14:45,920
is related this is directly related to

2142
01:14:45,920 --> 01:14:46,960
the great barrington declaration the

2143
01:14:46,960 --> 01:14:49,040
great antarctic clergy said the lockdown

2144
01:14:49,040 --> 01:14:51,040
harms are devastating

2145
01:14:51,040 --> 01:14:53,199
to the population at large

2146
01:14:53,199 --> 01:14:54,560
there's this

2147
01:14:54,560 --> 01:14:56,080
considerable segment of people that are

2148
01:14:56,080 --> 01:14:57,199
vulnerable

2149
01:14:57,199 --> 01:14:59,040
protect them well with the vaccine we

2150
01:14:59,040 --> 01:15:00,640
have a perfect tool to protect the

2151
01:15:00,640 --> 01:15:02,640
vulnerable which is i still believe i

2152
01:15:02,640 --> 01:15:05,520
mean is true right you vaccinate the

2153
01:15:05,520 --> 01:15:07,600
vulnerable the older population and as

2154
01:15:07,600 --> 01:15:09,280
you said there's a tenfold decrease in

2155
01:15:09,280 --> 01:15:10,880
the mortality risk

2156
01:15:10,880 --> 01:15:13,040
um from getting infected

2157
01:15:13,040 --> 01:15:15,360
which is i mean amazing so that was the

2158
01:15:15,360 --> 01:15:17,360
strategy we got we outlined what

2159
01:15:17,360 --> 01:15:19,679
happened is that the vaccine debate got

2160
01:15:19,679 --> 01:15:21,760
transformed so first there's so you're

2161
01:15:21,760 --> 01:15:22,960
asking about vaccine hesitance i think

2162
01:15:22,960 --> 01:15:24,080
there's there's first there's like

2163
01:15:24,080 --> 01:15:26,159
there's there's the inherent

2164
01:15:26,159 --> 01:15:28,560
limitations of how to measure vaccine

2165
01:15:28,560 --> 01:15:30,320
safety right so we talked about a little

2166
01:15:30,320 --> 01:15:32,480
bit about the trial but also after the

2167
01:15:32,480 --> 01:15:34,159
trial there's a there's a there's a

2168
01:15:34,159 --> 01:15:36,239
mechanism and this is the work i've been

2169
01:15:36,239 --> 01:15:38,880
involved with before covet on

2170
01:15:38,880 --> 01:15:41,679
on tracking and and identifying and

2171
01:15:41,679 --> 01:15:43,440
checking whether the vaccines actually

2172
01:15:43,440 --> 01:15:45,199
are safe and the central challenge is

2173
01:15:45,199 --> 01:15:47,040
one of causality

2174
01:15:47,040 --> 01:15:48,480
so you no longer have the randomized

2175
01:15:48,480 --> 01:15:50,400
trial

2176
01:15:50,400 --> 01:15:52,640
but but you want to know is the vaccine

2177
01:15:52,640 --> 01:15:54,640
when is deployed at scale

2178
01:15:54,640 --> 01:15:55,679
causing

2179
01:15:55,679 --> 01:15:57,760
adverse events

2180
01:15:57,760 --> 01:15:59,280
well you can't just look at people who

2181
01:15:59,280 --> 01:16:00,719
are vaccinated and see what adverse

2182
01:16:00,719 --> 01:16:01,920
events happen

2183
01:16:01,920 --> 01:16:03,040
because you don't know what would have

2184
01:16:03,040 --> 01:16:05,120
happened if the person had not been

2185
01:16:05,120 --> 01:16:06,880
vaccinated

2186
01:16:06,880 --> 01:16:09,760
so you have to have some control group

2187
01:16:09,760 --> 01:16:11,440
now what happened is there's several

2188
01:16:11,440 --> 01:16:13,679
systems to do to check this in that the

2189
01:16:13,679 --> 01:16:16,560
cdc uses one one very very very commonly

2190
01:16:16,560 --> 01:16:18,159
known one now is called vares the

2191
01:16:18,159 --> 01:16:20,480
vaccine adverse event reporting system

2192
01:16:20,480 --> 01:16:22,640
there anyone who has an adverse event

2193
01:16:22,640 --> 01:16:24,480
that either either a regular person or a

2194
01:16:24,480 --> 01:16:27,040
doctor can just go report look i have

2195
01:16:27,040 --> 01:16:28,480
the vaccine and two days later i had a

2196
01:16:28,480 --> 01:16:30,640
headache or whatever it is

2197
01:16:30,640 --> 01:16:31,920
the person died

2198
01:16:31,920 --> 01:16:34,640
a day after the vaccine right um now you

2199
01:16:34,640 --> 01:16:36,159
vaccinate that the vaccine was rolled

2200
01:16:36,159 --> 01:16:38,640
out to older people first

2201
01:16:38,640 --> 01:16:41,199
and older people die sometimes with or

2202
01:16:41,199 --> 01:16:43,040
without the vaccine so

2203
01:16:43,040 --> 01:16:44,080
sometimes you'll see someone's

2204
01:16:44,080 --> 01:16:46,560
vaccinated and a few days later they die

2205
01:16:46,560 --> 01:16:48,080
did the vaccine cause it or something

2206
01:16:48,080 --> 01:16:50,159
else cause it's really difficult to tell

2207
01:16:50,159 --> 01:16:51,600
in order to tell you need a control

2208
01:16:51,600 --> 01:16:53,440
group

2209
01:16:53,440 --> 01:16:55,199
for that um

2210
01:16:55,199 --> 01:16:57,360
there are other systems the fda and cdc

2211
01:16:57,360 --> 01:16:58,159
have

2212
01:16:58,159 --> 01:17:00,560
uh like there's one called vsd vaccine

2213
01:17:00,560 --> 01:17:02,880
safety data link there's another system

2214
01:17:02,880 --> 01:17:04,080
called best

2215
01:17:04,080 --> 01:17:04,880
uh

2216
01:17:04,880 --> 01:17:07,440
i forget the app with the acronym is to

2217
01:17:07,440 --> 01:17:10,159
essentially to track uh cohorts of

2218
01:17:10,159 --> 01:17:11,360
people

2219
01:17:11,360 --> 01:17:14,239
vaccinated versus unvaccinated was as

2220
01:17:14,239 --> 01:17:15,679
careful of matching as you can do it's

2221
01:17:15,679 --> 01:17:18,320
not randomized but and then c

2222
01:17:18,320 --> 01:17:20,080
if you have

2223
01:17:20,080 --> 01:17:22,719
safety signals that pop up in the

2224
01:17:22,719 --> 01:17:24,640
vaccinated relative to the control group

2225
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:26,320
unvaccinated

2226
01:17:26,320 --> 01:17:29,120
um and so that's for instance how the

2227
01:17:29,120 --> 01:17:31,840
the the myocarditis risk was picked up

2228
01:17:31,840 --> 01:17:34,080
in young young especially young men

2229
01:17:34,080 --> 01:17:36,000
it's also how the

2230
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,960
higher risk of blood clots in middle age

2231
01:17:38,960 --> 01:17:41,920
and older women in with the jnj vaccine

2232
01:17:41,920 --> 01:17:42,840
is picked

2233
01:17:42,840 --> 01:17:46,320
up there what you have is are situations

2234
01:17:46,320 --> 01:17:48,560
where the baseline risk of these

2235
01:17:48,560 --> 01:17:51,440
outcomes are so low that if you see them

2236
01:17:51,440 --> 01:17:54,000
in the con in the vaccinated arm at all

2237
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:55,440
then it's not hard to understand that

2238
01:17:55,440 --> 01:17:57,360
the vaccine did this right

2239
01:17:57,360 --> 01:17:58,880
young men should not be having

2240
01:17:58,880 --> 01:18:00,480
myocarditis

2241
01:18:00,480 --> 01:18:02,159
middle-aged women should not be having

2242
01:18:02,159 --> 01:18:04,239
huge blood clots in the brain right um

2243
01:18:04,239 --> 01:18:05,520
so when you see that you can say it's

2244
01:18:05,520 --> 01:18:07,760
linked now the rates are low so young

2245
01:18:07,760 --> 01:18:09,760
men maybe one in five thousand one in

2246
01:18:09,760 --> 01:18:11,760
ten thousand of the vaccine of my

2247
01:18:11,760 --> 01:18:14,320
vaccine-related myocarditis pericarditis

2248
01:18:14,320 --> 01:18:17,199
um young women of middle-aged women i

2249
01:18:17,199 --> 01:18:18,880
don't know i don't i'm not sure what the

2250
01:18:18,880 --> 01:18:20,239
right number might be but like i'd say

2251
01:18:20,239 --> 01:18:22,239
it's like in the you know one in

2252
01:18:22,239 --> 01:18:24,000
hundreds of thousands something like

2253
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,320
that

2254
01:18:26,320 --> 01:18:28,159
so these are rare outcomes but they're

2255
01:18:28,159 --> 01:18:29,679
they're they are vaccinating linked

2256
01:18:29,679 --> 01:18:30,880
outcomes

2257
01:18:30,880 --> 01:18:33,440
how do you deal with that as a messaging

2258
01:18:33,440 --> 01:18:35,360
thing i think you just tell people you

2259
01:18:35,360 --> 01:18:36,719
tell people here are the risks you

2260
01:18:36,719 --> 01:18:38,239
transparently tell them and just you're

2261
01:18:38,239 --> 01:18:39,199
not you're not they're so they're not

2262
01:18:39,199 --> 01:18:40,320
getting into something that they don't

2263
01:18:40,320 --> 01:18:41,040
know

2264
01:18:41,040 --> 01:18:44,320
yeah and um don't treat people like

2265
01:18:44,320 --> 01:18:47,199
their children and need to be told lies

2266
01:18:47,199 --> 01:18:48,880
because they won't understand the full

2267
01:18:48,880 --> 01:18:51,520
complexity of the truth uh people i

2268
01:18:51,520 --> 01:18:56,080
think are pretty good at um or actually

2269
01:18:56,080 --> 01:18:57,040
you know

2270
01:18:57,040 --> 01:18:58,560
people with time are good at

2271
01:18:58,560 --> 01:19:00,640
understanding data but better than

2272
01:19:00,640 --> 01:19:02,960
anything they're uh

2273
01:19:02,960 --> 01:19:05,360
they're better at they're extremely good

2274
01:19:05,360 --> 01:19:08,880
at detecting arrogance and and

2275
01:19:08,880 --> 01:19:10,719
yeah give them either one of those i

2276
01:19:10,719 --> 01:19:12,159
mean i'll give you one that's where i

2277
01:19:12,159 --> 01:19:13,920
think it's greatly undermined vaccine

2278
01:19:13,920 --> 01:19:14,960
has

2279
01:19:14,960 --> 01:19:16,159
greatly undermined the demand for the

2280
01:19:16,159 --> 01:19:19,440
vaccine is this weird denial that if you

2281
01:19:19,440 --> 01:19:21,600
recover from kovid you have extremely

2282
01:19:21,600 --> 01:19:23,120
good

2283
01:19:23,120 --> 01:19:25,199
immunity both against infection and

2284
01:19:25,199 --> 01:19:26,960
actually exchange

2285
01:19:26,960 --> 01:19:29,199
and that denial

2286
01:19:29,199 --> 01:19:31,760
leads to people distrusting the message

2287
01:19:31,760 --> 01:19:33,440
given by like the cdc director for

2288
01:19:33,440 --> 01:19:35,600
instance favored the vaccine

2289
01:19:35,600 --> 01:19:38,000
right why would you deny a thing that's

2290
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:39,840
such an obvious fact it's like you can

2291
01:19:39,840 --> 01:19:42,400
look at the data and it just i mean it

2292
01:19:42,400 --> 01:19:44,000
just just pops out at you that people

2293
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:45,679
that are covered recovered

2294
01:19:45,679 --> 01:19:47,120
are not getting infected again at very

2295
01:19:47,120 --> 01:19:48,640
high rates

2296
01:19:48,640 --> 01:19:51,040
much lower rates after these kinds of

2297
01:19:51,040 --> 01:19:52,880
conversations um

2298
01:19:52,880 --> 01:19:54,400
i'm sure after this com very

2299
01:19:54,400 --> 01:19:57,520
conversation i often get uh a number of

2300
01:19:57,520 --> 01:20:00,000
messages from joe joe rogan and from sam

2301
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:03,600
harris who to me are people i admire i

2302
01:20:03,600 --> 01:20:05,360
think are really intelligent thoughtful

2303
01:20:05,360 --> 01:20:08,320
human beings they also have a platform

2304
01:20:08,320 --> 01:20:11,040
and i i i believe at least in my mind

2305
01:20:11,040 --> 01:20:12,960
about this coveted

2306
01:20:12,960 --> 01:20:15,760
set of topics they represent

2307
01:20:15,760 --> 01:20:18,800
a group of people

2308
01:20:19,760 --> 01:20:21,679
each group has

2309
01:20:21,679 --> 01:20:23,280
smart

2310
01:20:23,280 --> 01:20:25,600
thoughtful

2311
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:28,080
well-intentioned human beings and i

2312
01:20:28,080 --> 01:20:30,159
don't know who is right

2313
01:20:30,159 --> 01:20:33,600
but i i do know that they're kind of

2314
01:20:33,600 --> 01:20:35,600
tribal a little bit

2315
01:20:35,600 --> 01:20:39,440
uh those groups and so

2316
01:20:39,520 --> 01:20:41,120
the question i want to ask is like what

2317
01:20:41,120 --> 01:20:43,440
do you think about these

2318
01:20:43,440 --> 01:20:44,840
uh two

2319
01:20:44,840 --> 01:20:47,840
groups and this kind of tension over the

2320
01:20:47,840 --> 01:20:49,760
vaccine

2321
01:20:49,760 --> 01:20:51,679
that sometimes it just keeps finding

2322
01:20:51,679 --> 01:20:54,000
different topics

2323
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,080
on which to focus on like whether kids

2324
01:20:56,080 --> 01:20:58,000
should get vaccinated or not whether

2325
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,239
there should be vaccine mandates or not

2326
01:21:00,239 --> 01:21:02,239
which seem to be often very kind of

2327
01:21:02,239 --> 01:21:04,880
specific policy kinds of questions right

2328
01:21:04,880 --> 01:21:06,960
it's the bigger picture i think it's a

2329
01:21:06,960 --> 01:21:08,880
symptom of the distrust that people have

2330
01:21:08,880 --> 01:21:10,320
in public health

2331
01:21:10,320 --> 01:21:13,199
i think this kind of schism over the the

2332
01:21:13,199 --> 01:21:15,280
vaccine does not happen in places where

2333
01:21:15,280 --> 01:21:16,719
the public health authorities have been

2334
01:21:16,719 --> 01:21:18,560
much more trustworthy

2335
01:21:18,560 --> 01:21:20,000
right so you don't see this vaccine

2336
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,480
hasn't seen sweden for instance

2337
01:21:22,480 --> 01:21:23,679
um

2338
01:21:23,679 --> 01:21:25,600
what's happened in the united states is

2339
01:21:25,600 --> 01:21:28,880
the vaccine has become

2340
01:21:29,040 --> 01:21:30,960
first because of politics but then also

2341
01:21:30,960 --> 01:21:33,120
because of the scientific arrogance this

2342
01:21:33,120 --> 01:21:35,679
sort of touchstone issue and people line

2343
01:21:35,679 --> 01:21:37,440
up on you on both sides of it and the

2344
01:21:37,440 --> 01:21:39,440
different language you're hearing

2345
01:21:39,440 --> 01:21:41,520
is structured around that so before the

2346
01:21:41,520 --> 01:21:43,679
election for instance i did uh

2347
01:21:43,679 --> 01:21:46,000
uh i was a i did a testimony in the

2348
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,239
house on on measurement of vaccine

2349
01:21:48,239 --> 01:21:49,679
safety

2350
01:21:49,679 --> 01:21:51,840
and i i was i was invited by the

2351
01:21:51,840 --> 01:21:53,679
republicans there were i think uh four

2352
01:21:53,679 --> 01:21:55,120
other experts invited by the democrats

2353
01:21:55,120 --> 01:21:56,159
or three other experts invited by

2354
01:21:56,159 --> 01:21:57,440
democrats

2355
01:21:57,440 --> 01:21:59,199
each of whom had a lot of experience in

2356
01:21:59,199 --> 01:22:01,360
measuring vaccine safety i was really

2357
01:22:01,360 --> 01:22:04,080
surprised to hear them each

2358
01:22:04,080 --> 01:22:06,000
doubt whether the fda would do a

2359
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:07,600
reasonable job in assessing vaccine

2360
01:22:07,600 --> 01:22:08,639
safety

2361
01:22:08,639 --> 01:22:10,639
including by people who have long

2362
01:22:10,639 --> 01:22:12,800
records of working with the fda

2363
01:22:12,800 --> 01:22:14,480
i mean these are

2364
01:22:14,480 --> 01:22:15,760
professionals

2365
01:22:15,760 --> 01:22:18,400
great scientists whose main you know

2366
01:22:18,400 --> 01:22:19,840
sort of goal in life is to make sure

2367
01:22:19,840 --> 01:22:21,920
that safe vaccine that that unsafe

2368
01:22:21,920 --> 01:22:23,360
vaccines don't get released into the

2369
01:22:23,360 --> 01:22:26,239
world and if they argue they get pulled

2370
01:22:26,239 --> 01:22:28,400
and they're casting down on the vaccine

2371
01:22:28,400 --> 01:22:30,400
the ability to track vaccine safety

2372
01:22:30,400 --> 01:22:33,280
before the election

2373
01:22:33,280 --> 01:22:36,080
and then after the election

2374
01:22:36,080 --> 01:22:39,040
the the rhetoric switched on a dime

2375
01:22:39,040 --> 01:22:40,800
right all of a sudden it's republicans

2376
01:22:40,800 --> 01:22:42,560
that are cast as if they're vaccine

2377
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:43,760
hesitant

2378
01:22:43,760 --> 01:22:45,760
that kind of political shift

2379
01:22:45,760 --> 01:22:47,679
the public notices

2380
01:22:47,679 --> 01:22:49,920
if if all it takes is an election to

2381
01:22:49,920 --> 01:22:51,679
change how people talk about the safety

2382
01:22:51,679 --> 01:22:53,520
of the vaccine well we're not talking

2383
01:22:53,520 --> 01:22:55,600
science anymore many people think right

2384
01:22:55,600 --> 01:22:57,199
i think that creates created its

2385
01:22:57,199 --> 01:22:59,120
hesitancy

2386
01:22:59,120 --> 01:23:01,520
the other thing i think the um

2387
01:23:01,520 --> 01:23:02,239
the

2388
01:23:02,239 --> 01:23:04,159
the hesitancy

2389
01:23:04,159 --> 01:23:06,639
some politicians viewed it as a

2390
01:23:06,639 --> 01:23:07,760
political

2391
01:23:07,760 --> 01:23:10,560
as sort of like a political opportunity

2392
01:23:10,560 --> 01:23:12,560
to sort of demonize people who were

2393
01:23:12,560 --> 01:23:14,159
hesitant

2394
01:23:14,159 --> 01:23:16,639
and that itself fueled hesitancy right

2395
01:23:16,639 --> 01:23:18,000
like the if you're if you're telling me

2396
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:19,360
i'm a rube that just doesn't want the

2397
01:23:19,360 --> 01:23:20,719
vaccine because i want everyone to die

2398
01:23:20,719 --> 01:23:22,639
well i'm gonna i'm gonna react really

2399
01:23:22,639 --> 01:23:25,040
negatively

2400
01:23:25,040 --> 01:23:27,520
and if you're talking down to me

2401
01:23:27,520 --> 01:23:29,120
about

2402
01:23:29,120 --> 01:23:30,719
my legitimate

2403
01:23:30,719 --> 01:23:32,159
you know sort of

2404
01:23:32,159 --> 01:23:33,679
concerns about whether this vaccine's

2405
01:23:33,679 --> 01:23:36,080
safe to i mean i've like heard from

2406
01:23:36,080 --> 01:23:37,199
women who are thinking about getting

2407
01:23:37,199 --> 01:23:38,719
pregnant should i take the vaccine i

2408
01:23:38,719 --> 01:23:40,159
don't know i mean there are all kinds of

2409
01:23:40,159 --> 01:23:41,120
questions

2410
01:23:41,120 --> 01:23:44,239
legitimate questions that i think

2411
01:23:44,239 --> 01:23:46,000
should have good data to answer that we

2412
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:47,120
don't necessarily have good data to

2413
01:23:47,120 --> 01:23:49,120
answer so what do you do in the face of

2414
01:23:49,120 --> 01:23:50,080
that

2415
01:23:50,080 --> 01:23:50,880
well

2416
01:23:50,880 --> 01:23:53,520
one reaction is to pretend like we we

2417
01:23:53,520 --> 01:23:55,360
know for a fact that it's safe

2418
01:23:55,360 --> 01:23:57,360
when we don't have the data to know for

2419
01:23:57,360 --> 01:23:58,639
fact in that particular group with that

2420
01:23:58,639 --> 01:24:00,320
particular set of clinical circumstances

2421
01:24:00,320 --> 01:24:01,760
you know

2422
01:24:01,760 --> 01:24:03,920
and that i think breeds hesitancy people

2423
01:24:03,920 --> 01:24:06,719
can detect that um whereas if

2424
01:24:06,719 --> 01:24:08,000
you just tell people you know i don't

2425
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:09,199
know

2426
01:24:09,199 --> 01:24:10,960
yeah you deal with humility yeah you're

2427
01:24:10,960 --> 01:24:12,639
gonna you're you'll end up with a better

2428
01:24:12,639 --> 01:24:14,480
result

2429
01:24:14,480 --> 01:24:16,480
let me ask you about i've recently had a

2430
01:24:16,480 --> 01:24:19,520
conversation with the pfizer ceo

2431
01:24:19,520 --> 01:24:21,920
this is

2432
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,719
part therapy session part advice because

2433
01:24:24,719 --> 01:24:28,239
i again i really want

2434
01:24:28,239 --> 01:24:30,000
us to get through this together and it

2435
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:31,840
feels like the division is a thing that

2436
01:24:31,840 --> 01:24:33,679
uh prevents us from getting through this

2437
01:24:33,679 --> 01:24:35,199
together

2438
01:24:35,199 --> 01:24:38,080
and uh once again just like with francis

2439
01:24:38,080 --> 01:24:40,080
collins a lot of people

2440
01:24:40,080 --> 01:24:42,080
wrote to me

2441
01:24:42,080 --> 01:24:43,600
words of support

2442
01:24:43,600 --> 01:24:46,239
and a lot of people wrote to me words of

2443
01:24:46,239 --> 01:24:48,800
criticism

2444
01:24:48,800 --> 01:24:50,880
i'm trying to understand

2445
01:24:50,880 --> 01:24:53,040
the nature of the criticism

2446
01:24:53,040 --> 01:24:56,239
so some of the criticism had to do with

2447
01:24:56,239 --> 01:24:58,080
against the vaccine and those kinds of

2448
01:24:58,080 --> 01:24:59,760
things that i have a better

2449
01:24:59,760 --> 01:25:02,080
understanding of

2450
01:25:02,080 --> 01:25:02,800
but

2451
01:25:02,800 --> 01:25:05,360
some kind of deep distrust

2452
01:25:05,360 --> 01:25:07,360
of pfizer

2453
01:25:07,360 --> 01:25:08,400
so

2454
01:25:08,400 --> 01:25:09,280
um

2455
01:25:09,280 --> 01:25:11,840
actually looking at uh big pharma

2456
01:25:11,840 --> 01:25:13,679
broadly

2457
01:25:13,679 --> 01:25:15,120
i'm trying to

2458
01:25:15,120 --> 01:25:16,480
understand

2459
01:25:16,480 --> 01:25:19,520
am i so naive

2460
01:25:19,520 --> 01:25:22,320
that i just don't see it

2461
01:25:22,320 --> 01:25:24,719
because yes there's corrupt people and

2462
01:25:24,719 --> 01:25:27,520
they they're greedy they're flawed in

2463
01:25:27,520 --> 01:25:29,760
all walks of life

2464
01:25:29,760 --> 01:25:32,560
but uh companies

2465
01:25:32,560 --> 01:25:33,679
do

2466
01:25:33,679 --> 01:25:36,560
quite an incredible job of taking a good

2467
01:25:36,560 --> 01:25:38,400
idea at the scale and making some money

2468
01:25:38,400 --> 01:25:40,239
with that idea but they are the ones

2469
01:25:40,239 --> 01:25:43,280
that achieve scale on a good idea

2470
01:25:43,280 --> 01:25:44,719
i don't know

2471
01:25:44,719 --> 01:25:47,840
it's not obvious to me i don't see

2472
01:25:47,840 --> 01:25:50,400
where the manipulation is so the fear

2473
01:25:50,400 --> 01:25:52,400
that people have and

2474
01:25:52,400 --> 01:25:55,199
i talked to joe about this quite a bit i

2475
01:25:55,199 --> 01:25:57,920
i think this is a legitimate fear and

2476
01:25:57,920 --> 01:26:00,719
and a fury should often have that money

2477
01:26:00,719 --> 01:26:03,120
has influenced disproportional influence

2478
01:26:03,120 --> 01:26:05,760
especially in politics so the fear is

2479
01:26:05,760 --> 01:26:07,199
that

2480
01:26:07,199 --> 01:26:08,560
the policy

2481
01:26:08,560 --> 01:26:11,360
of uh the vaccine was connected to the

2482
01:26:11,360 --> 01:26:12,560
fact that

2483
01:26:12,560 --> 01:26:14,639
lots of money could be made

2484
01:26:14,639 --> 01:26:17,440
by manufacturing the vaccine

2485
01:26:17,440 --> 01:26:19,199
and i understand that

2486
01:26:19,199 --> 01:26:21,120
and i'm it's actually quite a heck of a

2487
01:26:21,120 --> 01:26:24,400
difficult task to alleviate that concern

2488
01:26:24,400 --> 01:26:26,159
like you really have to be a great man

2489
01:26:26,159 --> 01:26:29,120
or woman or a leader to convince people

2490
01:26:29,120 --> 01:26:30,639
that you're not full of that you're

2491
01:26:30,639 --> 01:26:32,560
not just playing a game on them

2492
01:26:32,560 --> 01:26:34,719
i don't know it's a it's a difficult

2493
01:26:34,719 --> 01:26:37,040
task but at the same time i i really

2494
01:26:37,040 --> 01:26:39,840
don't like the natural

2495
01:26:39,840 --> 01:26:42,400
distrust every billionaire distrust

2496
01:26:42,400 --> 01:26:44,080
everybody who's trying to make money

2497
01:26:44,080 --> 01:26:45,600
because it feels like under a

2498
01:26:45,600 --> 01:26:47,840
capitalistic system at least

2499
01:26:47,840 --> 01:26:50,960
the the way to do a lot of good like to

2500
01:26:50,960 --> 01:26:53,120
do good at scale in the world

2501
01:26:53,120 --> 01:26:54,320
is by

2502
01:26:54,320 --> 01:26:57,440
being at least in part motivated by the

2503
01:26:57,440 --> 01:26:59,040
profit i mean i share your ambivalence

2504
01:26:59,040 --> 01:27:01,360
right so on the one hand you have a a

2505
01:27:01,360 --> 01:27:04,400
fantastic achievement the the the

2506
01:27:04,400 --> 01:27:06,560
manufacture the discovery of the vaccine

2507
01:27:06,560 --> 01:27:08,800
and then the manufacturing at scale

2508
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:10,159
so that

2509
01:27:10,159 --> 01:27:11,920
you know billions of people can take the

2510
01:27:11,920 --> 01:27:14,080
vaccine in a relatively short time that

2511
01:27:14,080 --> 01:27:15,920
is a remarkable achievement that could

2512
01:27:15,920 --> 01:27:18,320
not have happened without companies like

2513
01:27:18,320 --> 01:27:19,920
pfizer

2514
01:27:19,920 --> 01:27:22,320
um on the other hand the there is this

2515
01:27:22,320 --> 01:27:24,000
sort of corrupting influence of that

2516
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:25,199
money

2517
01:27:25,199 --> 01:27:27,199
uh uh just to give you one example uh

2518
01:27:27,199 --> 01:27:28,320
there's a there's an enormous

2519
01:27:28,320 --> 01:27:30,719
controversy over whether uh relatively

2520
01:27:30,719 --> 01:27:33,520
inexpensive repurposed drugs can be used

2521
01:27:33,520 --> 01:27:36,639
to treat the the the disease

2522
01:27:36,639 --> 01:27:38,320
um

2523
01:27:38,320 --> 01:27:40,800
none of no company like pfizer has any

2524
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:42,880
interest whatsoever in evaluating it

2525
01:27:42,880 --> 01:27:45,440
even merck i think support was merck

2526
01:27:45,440 --> 01:27:46,560
that

2527
01:27:46,560 --> 01:27:48,880
had the patent on ivormectin

2528
01:27:48,880 --> 01:27:51,760
uh now expired has no interest at all in

2529
01:27:51,760 --> 01:27:54,400
checking to see if it works

2530
01:27:54,400 --> 01:27:57,600
not only do they not have interest

2531
01:27:57,600 --> 01:27:59,199
they have

2532
01:27:59,199 --> 01:28:02,159
a way of talking about people who might

2533
01:28:02,159 --> 01:28:04,400
have a little bit of interest

2534
01:28:04,400 --> 01:28:07,040
that's again um fringe

2535
01:28:07,040 --> 01:28:08,000
uh

2536
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:10,239
full of arrogance yeah

2537
01:28:10,239 --> 01:28:12,800
and that that is what troubles me

2538
01:28:12,800 --> 01:28:15,040
is there not a it's back to the play of

2539
01:28:15,040 --> 01:28:16,639
science it's not they're not a bit of

2540
01:28:16,639 --> 01:28:19,360
curiosity one okay one the natural

2541
01:28:19,360 --> 01:28:20,960
curiosity of a human being that should

2542
01:28:20,960 --> 01:28:23,440
always be there and an open mind is and

2543
01:28:23,440 --> 01:28:25,840
second in the case of ivermectin and

2544
01:28:25,840 --> 01:28:27,840
other things like that you have to

2545
01:28:27,840 --> 01:28:30,000
acknowledge that there's a very large

2546
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:31,440
number of people

2547
01:28:31,440 --> 01:28:34,239
who care about this topic and this is a

2548
01:28:34,239 --> 01:28:37,840
way to inspire them to also play in the

2549
01:28:37,840 --> 01:28:39,440
space of science to inspire them with

2550
01:28:39,440 --> 01:28:41,679
science you can't just like dismiss

2551
01:28:41,679 --> 01:28:42,800
everybody

2552
01:28:42,800 --> 01:28:45,040
that uh you can't just dismiss people

2553
01:28:45,040 --> 01:28:47,040
period yeah well i mean i think here

2554
01:28:47,040 --> 01:28:48,480
here take ivermectin right there's

2555
01:28:48,480 --> 01:28:50,480
actually a study

2556
01:28:50,480 --> 01:28:54,239
funded by the nih by tony fauci's nia id

2557
01:28:54,239 --> 01:28:55,520
and the nih

2558
01:28:55,520 --> 01:28:58,159
um called active six

2559
01:28:58,159 --> 01:28:58,960
that's

2560
01:28:58,960 --> 01:29:02,639
a randomized trial of ivermectin

2561
01:29:02,639 --> 01:29:07,120
it's due to be completed in march 2023

2562
01:29:07,120 --> 01:29:10,480
so normally when you have uh private

2563
01:29:10,480 --> 01:29:12,239
actors like these big

2564
01:29:12,239 --> 01:29:14,719
drug companies that have no interest in

2565
01:29:14,719 --> 01:29:16,159
conducting some kind of scientific

2566
01:29:16,159 --> 01:29:17,440
experiment that would have some public

2567
01:29:17,440 --> 01:29:18,560
benefit

2568
01:29:18,560 --> 01:29:20,320
it's the job of the of the the

2569
01:29:20,320 --> 01:29:22,159
government and in this case the nih to

2570
01:29:22,159 --> 01:29:25,880
fund that kind of work the nih has been

2571
01:29:25,880 --> 01:29:29,120
incredibly slow

2572
01:29:29,120 --> 01:29:31,600
in its evaluations of these repurposed

2573
01:29:31,600 --> 01:29:32,800
drugs

2574
01:29:32,800 --> 01:29:34,480
and it's been left to lots of other

2575
01:29:34,480 --> 01:29:37,360
private private private activities

2576
01:29:37,360 --> 01:29:39,440
of uneven quality

2577
01:29:39,440 --> 01:29:40,880
and hence that's why you have these

2578
01:29:40,880 --> 01:29:42,239
these big fights

2579
01:29:42,239 --> 01:29:44,239
because the data are not solid you're

2580
01:29:44,239 --> 01:29:46,480
gonna have these big fights yeah but

2581
01:29:46,480 --> 01:29:49,120
also okay forget the the process of

2582
01:29:49,120 --> 01:29:51,920
science here the studies not enough

2583
01:29:51,920 --> 01:29:53,600
effort being put into the studies just

2584
01:29:53,600 --> 01:29:55,520
the way it's being communicated yeah no

2585
01:29:55,520 --> 01:29:58,159
like horse pace i mean come on the fda

2586
01:29:58,159 --> 01:30:00,880
put a tweet out telling people who are

2587
01:30:00,880 --> 01:30:01,679
like

2588
01:30:01,679 --> 01:30:02,960
they're taking iron mechanism because

2589
01:30:02,960 --> 01:30:04,159
they've heard good things about it and

2590
01:30:04,159 --> 01:30:06,320
they're sick and they're desperate and

2591
01:30:06,320 --> 01:30:08,080
just call it horse pace was just that

2592
01:30:08,080 --> 01:30:10,239
was that was terrible that was deeply

2593
01:30:10,239 --> 01:30:13,280
responsible my hope um is grounded in

2594
01:30:13,280 --> 01:30:15,280
the fact that young people see the the

2595
01:30:15,280 --> 01:30:17,679
 of this young phd students

2596
01:30:17,679 --> 01:30:19,360
graduate students young students in

2597
01:30:19,360 --> 01:30:21,440
college they see

2598
01:30:21,440 --> 01:30:24,159
the the

2599
01:30:24,159 --> 01:30:26,320
less than stellar way that our

2600
01:30:26,320 --> 01:30:28,239
scientific leaders and our political

2601
01:30:28,239 --> 01:30:29,920
leaders are behaving and then the new

2602
01:30:29,920 --> 01:30:32,159
generation will not repeat the mistakes

2603
01:30:32,159 --> 01:30:35,199
of the past that is my hope because uh

2604
01:30:35,199 --> 01:30:36,800
that that's the cool thing i see about

2605
01:30:36,800 --> 01:30:38,639
young people is they they

2606
01:30:38,639 --> 01:30:40,320
they're good at detecting and

2607
01:30:40,320 --> 01:30:42,800
they they don't want to be part of that

2608
01:30:42,800 --> 01:30:45,440
um that's my hope um in the space of

2609
01:30:45,440 --> 01:30:46,639
science

2610
01:30:46,639 --> 01:30:48,880
let me return to this idea of the great

2611
01:30:48,880 --> 01:30:51,360
barrington declaration return to the

2612
01:30:51,360 --> 01:30:52,639
beginning

2613
01:30:52,639 --> 01:30:54,880
so um what are the basics can you

2614
01:30:54,880 --> 01:30:56,400
describe what the great barrington

2615
01:30:56,400 --> 01:30:57,760
declaration is what are some of the

2616
01:30:57,760 --> 01:30:59,920
ideas in it you mentioned focused

2617
01:30:59,920 --> 01:31:01,360
protection

2618
01:31:01,360 --> 01:31:03,360
uh what are your concerns about

2619
01:31:03,360 --> 01:31:06,239
lockdowns just paint the picture of this

2620
01:31:06,239 --> 01:31:08,400
early proposal sure so uh the great

2621
01:31:08,400 --> 01:31:09,760
painting declaration first why is it

2622
01:31:09,760 --> 01:31:11,440
called great barrington declaration it

2623
01:31:11,440 --> 01:31:13,600
sounds it's such a great name

2624
01:31:13,600 --> 01:31:14,480
you

2625
01:31:14,480 --> 01:31:16,719
i mean it just it's such an epic name

2626
01:31:16,719 --> 01:31:18,560
but the the reason why it's called that

2627
01:31:18,560 --> 01:31:20,960
is way less than epic it's it was it was

2628
01:31:20,960 --> 01:31:24,000
because it the the conference um which

2629
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:25,760
is organized by martin kuldorf who's a

2630
01:31:25,760 --> 01:31:27,679
was a professor at harvard university uh

2631
01:31:27,679 --> 01:31:30,159
by a statistician he actually

2632
01:31:30,159 --> 01:31:31,360
designed

2633
01:31:31,360 --> 01:31:33,600
the the safety system the statistical

2634
01:31:33,600 --> 01:31:34,880
system that the

2635
01:31:34,880 --> 01:31:36,239
fda uses

2636
01:31:36,239 --> 01:31:37,040
for

2637
01:31:37,040 --> 01:31:38,960
tracking vaccine safety

2638
01:31:38,960 --> 01:31:39,679
he

2639
01:31:39,679 --> 01:31:42,320
and i had met previously just the summer

2640
01:31:42,320 --> 01:31:44,639
before that summer

2641
01:31:44,639 --> 01:31:47,040
and he invited me to come to this small

2642
01:31:47,040 --> 01:31:48,719
conference where he was inviting me and

2643
01:31:48,719 --> 01:31:51,520
sinatra gupta who was a professor of

2644
01:31:51,520 --> 01:31:53,679
theoretical epidemiology at harvard

2645
01:31:53,679 --> 01:31:56,159
at oxford university

2646
01:31:56,159 --> 01:31:58,480
and i mean i jumped at the chance

2647
01:31:58,480 --> 01:32:00,400
uh because i knew that martin and

2648
01:32:00,400 --> 01:32:02,560
sinatra were both smarter than me and uh

2649
01:32:02,560 --> 01:32:04,560
it would be fun to like talk about what

2650
01:32:04,560 --> 01:32:07,120
uh what the right strategy would be

2651
01:32:07,120 --> 01:32:09,280
on the drive in i didn't know what the

2652
01:32:09,280 --> 01:32:12,239
name of the town was and i asked as they

2653
01:32:12,239 --> 01:32:13,920
said was great barrington i had in the

2654
01:32:13,920 --> 01:32:15,280
back of my head

2655
01:32:15,280 --> 01:32:17,440
um martin and i arrived a little early

2656
01:32:17,440 --> 01:32:19,679
and we were writing an op-ed about some

2657
01:32:19,679 --> 01:32:20,960
of the ideas i hope we get to talk about

2658
01:32:20,960 --> 01:32:24,000
very soon um about focus protection and

2659
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:26,719
the right strategy and uh when sinetra

2660
01:32:26,719 --> 01:32:28,880
arrived we realized we actually come

2661
01:32:28,880 --> 01:32:30,400
basically to the same place about the

2662
01:32:30,400 --> 01:32:31,280
right

2663
01:32:31,280 --> 01:32:33,760
way to deal with the epidemic

2664
01:32:33,760 --> 01:32:36,239
um and i i thought well why don't we put

2665
01:32:36,239 --> 01:32:38,000
issue why don't we write something like

2666
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:39,679
the port hearing statement that was what

2667
01:32:39,679 --> 01:32:41,360
i had that in the back of my head yes

2668
01:32:41,360 --> 01:32:42,880
and i'm like well what's the name of

2669
01:32:42,880 --> 01:32:44,639
this town again it was great barrington

2670
01:32:44,639 --> 01:32:46,719
yeah so it's not barrington

2671
01:32:46,719 --> 01:32:48,960
it's great bear it's which is fantastic

2672
01:32:48,960 --> 01:32:50,000
right

2673
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:52,719
it's so over the top that it's perfect

2674
01:32:52,719 --> 01:32:53,760
it's it's

2675
01:32:53,760 --> 01:32:55,679
literally like the big bang

2676
01:32:55,679 --> 01:32:56,719
there's something about these

2677
01:32:56,719 --> 01:32:59,040
over-the-top fun titles that just really

2678
01:32:59,040 --> 01:33:00,480
deliver them

2679
01:33:00,480 --> 01:33:01,760
so that's why that's my my main

2680
01:33:01,760 --> 01:33:03,600
contribution was the word is the title

2681
01:33:03,600 --> 01:33:05,920
the name great barrington decor um but

2682
01:33:05,920 --> 01:33:07,760
yeah so it was it was kind of uh so the

2683
01:33:07,760 --> 01:33:10,080
and the the idea is actually

2684
01:33:10,080 --> 01:33:12,239
while the title is great um and i think

2685
01:33:12,239 --> 01:33:13,600
that it was written in a very stylish

2686
01:33:13,600 --> 01:33:14,400
way

2687
01:33:14,400 --> 01:33:16,239
um it's you know like it's a go it's

2688
01:33:16,239 --> 01:33:18,159
less than a page you can go look online

2689
01:33:18,159 --> 01:33:20,800
and read it it's written written for

2690
01:33:20,800 --> 01:33:22,639
not for scientists but for the general

2691
01:33:22,639 --> 01:33:24,159
public so people can understand the

2692
01:33:24,159 --> 01:33:26,800
ideas really simply

2693
01:33:26,800 --> 01:33:29,040
but it is not actually a radical set of

2694
01:33:29,040 --> 01:33:30,960
ideas it actually represents the old

2695
01:33:30,960 --> 01:33:32,719
pandemic plans

2696
01:33:32,719 --> 01:33:35,120
that we've used for century

2697
01:33:35,120 --> 01:33:38,239
dealing with other similar pandemics

2698
01:33:38,239 --> 01:33:41,440
um and and there's it's twofold uh first

2699
01:33:41,440 --> 01:33:43,120
let me talk about the science it rests

2700
01:33:43,120 --> 01:33:44,880
on and then i'll talk about the plan

2701
01:33:44,880 --> 01:33:46,159
the science actually some of what we

2702
01:33:46,159 --> 01:33:48,159
already talked about uh there's this

2703
01:33:48,159 --> 01:33:50,880
massive age gradient in the risk of

2704
01:33:50,880 --> 01:33:52,880
coven infection older people face much

2705
01:33:52,880 --> 01:33:55,600
higher risk than younger people

2706
01:33:55,600 --> 01:33:57,520
the second bit of science is all that's

2707
01:33:57,520 --> 01:33:59,120
not controversial right that even if you

2708
01:33:59,120 --> 01:34:02,000
think the ifr is 0.7 or or or 0.2 no

2709
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:03,679
matter what everyone thinks everyone

2710
01:34:03,679 --> 01:34:06,560
agrees on this age gradient

2711
01:34:06,560 --> 01:34:08,080
the second bit of science is also not

2712
01:34:08,080 --> 01:34:10,239
controversial

2713
01:34:10,239 --> 01:34:12,320
the lockdown focused policies that we

2714
01:34:12,320 --> 01:34:13,360
followed

2715
01:34:13,360 --> 01:34:16,320
have absolutely devastating consequences

2716
01:34:16,320 --> 01:34:19,840
on the health of the population

2717
01:34:19,840 --> 01:34:22,000
let me just give you some examples uh

2718
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:23,520
and this is this was known in october of

2719
01:34:23,520 --> 01:34:26,560
2020 we wrote it right so um the un was

2720
01:34:26,560 --> 01:34:29,600
sounding alarms that there would be

2721
01:34:29,600 --> 01:34:32,239
tens of millions of people who would

2722
01:34:32,239 --> 01:34:34,639
starve as a consequence of the economic

2723
01:34:34,639 --> 01:34:37,280
dislocation caused by the lockdowns

2724
01:34:37,280 --> 01:34:38,719
and that's come to pass

2725
01:34:38,719 --> 01:34:40,800
hundreds of thousands of children in

2726
01:34:40,800 --> 01:34:42,560
places like south asia dead from

2727
01:34:42,560 --> 01:34:45,199
starvation

2728
01:34:45,199 --> 01:34:48,320
as a consequence of lockdowns

2729
01:34:48,320 --> 01:34:49,199
um

2730
01:34:49,199 --> 01:34:52,000
the the the the uh uh

2731
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:54,000
priorities like

2732
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:55,119
the treatment of patients with

2733
01:34:55,119 --> 01:34:56,639
tuberculosis

2734
01:34:56,639 --> 01:34:58,960
in poor countries stopped

2735
01:34:58,960 --> 01:35:01,040
because of lockdowns

2736
01:35:01,040 --> 01:35:01,920
uh

2737
01:35:01,920 --> 01:35:03,920
childhood vaccinations of

2738
01:35:03,920 --> 01:35:05,840
measles rubella

2739
01:35:05,840 --> 01:35:09,280
dpt diphtheria so on pertussis tetanus

2740
01:35:09,280 --> 01:35:12,000
all those standard vaccination campaigns

2741
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:13,199
stopped

2742
01:35:13,199 --> 01:35:15,360
tens of millions of children skipping

2743
01:35:15,360 --> 01:35:16,800
these doses

2744
01:35:16,800 --> 01:35:18,800
for diseases that are actually deadly

2745
01:35:18,800 --> 01:35:20,400
for them

2746
01:35:20,400 --> 01:35:23,440
is there just a on a small tangent

2747
01:35:23,440 --> 01:35:25,920
is it well understood to you what are

2748
01:35:25,920 --> 01:35:27,679
the mechanisms that stop all those

2749
01:35:27,679 --> 01:35:29,679
things because of lockdowns is it some

2750
01:35:29,679 --> 01:35:31,760
aspect of supply chain is it just

2751
01:35:31,760 --> 01:35:33,119
literally because

2752
01:35:33,119 --> 01:35:35,040
hospital doors are closed

2753
01:35:35,040 --> 01:35:37,520
is it because there's a disincentive to

2754
01:35:37,520 --> 01:35:39,600
go outside by people even when they

2755
01:35:39,600 --> 01:35:42,239
deeply need help it's all of the above

2756
01:35:42,239 --> 01:35:44,320
uh but a lot of those efforts especially

2757
01:35:44,320 --> 01:35:45,440
especially those like vaccination

2758
01:35:45,440 --> 01:35:48,719
efforts are funded and run by what

2759
01:35:48,719 --> 01:35:51,280
western efforts like gavi is a

2760
01:35:51,280 --> 01:35:52,560
i think it's a gates funded thing

2761
01:35:52,560 --> 01:35:55,119
actually that produce provides vaccines

2762
01:35:55,119 --> 01:35:58,080
for you know millions of kids worldwide

2763
01:35:58,080 --> 01:36:01,119
and those efforts were scaled back

2764
01:36:01,119 --> 01:36:03,440
malaria prevention efforts so in the

2765
01:36:03,440 --> 01:36:06,000
developing world it was a devastating

2766
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:08,480
effect these lockdowns um there was also

2767
01:36:08,480 --> 01:36:10,639
direct effects like in india the

2768
01:36:10,639 --> 01:36:12,400
uh the lockdowns when they first

2769
01:36:12,400 --> 01:36:14,960
instituted there was an order that 10

2770
01:36:14,960 --> 01:36:17,199
million migrant workers

2771
01:36:17,199 --> 01:36:19,199
who live in big cities and they live

2772
01:36:19,199 --> 01:36:21,920
hand-to-mouth they buy you know coconuts

2773
01:36:21,920 --> 01:36:23,600
they sell the coconuts with the money

2774
01:36:23,600 --> 01:36:24,960
they buy food for themselves and

2775
01:36:24,960 --> 01:36:28,159
coconuts for the next day to sell um

2776
01:36:28,159 --> 01:36:30,239
walk back to their villages or get or

2777
01:36:30,239 --> 01:36:32,560
get go back to their villages then

2778
01:36:32,560 --> 01:36:34,960
overnight so 10 million people walking

2779
01:36:34,960 --> 01:36:36,560
back to their villages or taking a train

2780
01:36:36,560 --> 01:36:38,960
back a thousand died on route

2781
01:36:38,960 --> 01:36:41,199
overcrowded trains dying essentially on

2782
01:36:41,199 --> 01:36:42,480
the side of the road i mean it was it

2783
01:36:42,480 --> 01:36:45,760
was absolutely inhumane policy

2784
01:36:45,760 --> 01:36:49,280
uh and uh the lockdowns there

2785
01:36:49,280 --> 01:36:51,600
what what it's it's actually it's kind

2786
01:36:51,600 --> 01:36:52,800
of like what's happened to the west as

2787
01:36:52,800 --> 01:36:55,760
well but it was so severe uh there was a

2788
01:36:55,760 --> 01:36:58,560
zero prevalence study done in mumbai by

2789
01:36:58,560 --> 01:36:59,600
a friend of mine at the university of

2790
01:36:59,600 --> 01:37:01,600
chicago what he found was that in the

2791
01:37:01,600 --> 01:37:03,440
slums of mumbai

2792
01:37:03,440 --> 01:37:05,760
there were 70 surah prevalence in july

2793
01:37:05,760 --> 01:37:08,560
or august of seven of sept of 2020

2794
01:37:08,560 --> 01:37:11,280
whereas in the rest of mumbai is 20

2795
01:37:11,280 --> 01:37:13,520
yeah right so it was incredibly unequal

2796
01:37:13,520 --> 01:37:16,239
the the lockdowns protected the the

2797
01:37:16,239 --> 01:37:18,480
relatively well off and spread the

2798
01:37:18,480 --> 01:37:19,520
disease

2799
01:37:19,520 --> 01:37:21,760
among the poor

2800
01:37:21,760 --> 01:37:25,360
um so uh that's in the developing world

2801
01:37:25,360 --> 01:37:26,480
in the developed world the health

2802
01:37:26,480 --> 01:37:28,880
effects of lockdowns were

2803
01:37:28,880 --> 01:37:30,719
also quite bad

2804
01:37:30,719 --> 01:37:32,080
right so we talked already about

2805
01:37:32,080 --> 01:37:34,400
isolation and depression there was a

2806
01:37:34,400 --> 01:37:37,520
study done in july of 2020

2807
01:37:37,520 --> 01:37:41,199
that found that one in four young adults

2808
01:37:41,199 --> 01:37:43,199
seriously considered suicide

2809
01:37:43,199 --> 01:37:46,880
now suicide rates haven't like spiked up

2810
01:37:46,880 --> 01:37:49,840
so much but the depths of despair that

2811
01:37:49,840 --> 01:37:51,920
would lead somebody to seriously

2812
01:37:51,920 --> 01:37:54,159
consider suicide itself should be should

2813
01:37:54,159 --> 01:37:56,400
be a source of great concern for in

2814
01:37:56,400 --> 01:37:57,679
public health

2815
01:37:57,679 --> 01:38:00,000
yeah this is one of the troubling things

2816
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:03,040
about measuring well-being is

2817
01:38:03,040 --> 01:38:04,880
we're okay at measuring death and

2818
01:38:04,880 --> 01:38:06,080
suicide

2819
01:38:06,080 --> 01:38:08,800
we're not so good at measuring suffering

2820
01:38:08,800 --> 01:38:11,440
it's like people talk about

2821
01:38:11,440 --> 01:38:13,280
um maybe even

2822
01:38:13,280 --> 01:38:16,960
harder more in the under stalin or the

2823
01:38:16,960 --> 01:38:19,760
concentration camps with hitler we talk

2824
01:38:19,760 --> 01:38:21,199
about deaths

2825
01:38:21,199 --> 01:38:22,880
but we don't talk about

2826
01:38:22,880 --> 01:38:26,080
the suffering over periods of years

2827
01:38:26,080 --> 01:38:28,159
by people living in fear by people

2828
01:38:28,159 --> 01:38:29,360
starving

2829
01:38:29,360 --> 01:38:31,679
psychological trauma that lasts a

2830
01:38:31,679 --> 01:38:33,840
lifetime all of those things

2831
01:38:33,840 --> 01:38:35,600
i mean and just to get back to that that

2832
01:38:35,600 --> 01:38:37,920
point we close schools especially in

2833
01:38:37,920 --> 01:38:40,000
blue states we close schools

2834
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:42,159
now richer parents could send their kids

2835
01:38:42,159 --> 01:38:43,679
to private schools many of which stayed

2836
01:38:43,679 --> 01:38:45,199
open even in the blue states they could

2837
01:38:45,199 --> 01:38:47,280
get pods they could get tutors but

2838
01:38:47,280 --> 01:38:49,360
that's not true for for poorer and

2839
01:38:49,360 --> 01:38:51,679
middle class parents

2840
01:38:51,679 --> 01:38:54,159
and as a result what we did is we took

2841
01:38:54,159 --> 01:38:56,080
away life opportunities for kids we we

2842
01:38:56,080 --> 01:38:57,600
tried to teach

2843
01:38:57,600 --> 01:38:59,440
five-year-olds to read via zoom in

2844
01:38:59,440 --> 01:39:01,199
kindergarten

2845
01:39:01,199 --> 01:39:02,719
right uh

2846
01:39:02,719 --> 01:39:04,719
and uh the consequence actually you

2847
01:39:04,719 --> 01:39:06,239
think okay we can just make it up but

2848
01:39:06,239 --> 01:39:08,960
it's really difficult to make that up

2849
01:39:08,960 --> 01:39:11,679
there's a literature in health economics

2850
01:39:11,679 --> 01:39:13,920
that shows that even uh

2851
01:39:13,920 --> 01:39:14,800
you know

2852
01:39:14,800 --> 01:39:17,440
relatively small disruptions in

2853
01:39:17,440 --> 01:39:20,159
schooling can have lifelong consequences

2854
01:39:20,159 --> 01:39:22,159
negative consequences for kids

2855
01:39:22,159 --> 01:39:25,360
right so they end up growing up poorer

2856
01:39:25,360 --> 01:39:27,440
they they lead shorter lives and less

2857
01:39:27,440 --> 01:39:28,719
healthy lives

2858
01:39:28,719 --> 01:39:30,400
as a consequence that's and that's what

2859
01:39:30,400 --> 01:39:32,239
the literature now shows is likely to

2860
01:39:32,239 --> 01:39:34,480
happen with the interruptions of

2861
01:39:34,480 --> 01:39:36,080
schooling that we had in the united

2862
01:39:36,080 --> 01:39:37,760
states many european countries actually

2863
01:39:37,760 --> 01:39:39,600
managed to avoid this there were in the

2864
01:39:39,600 --> 01:39:41,280
early days the epidemic great

2865
01:39:41,280 --> 01:39:43,520
indications that children first were not

2866
01:39:43,520 --> 01:39:45,600
very severe severely at risk from covet

2867
01:39:45,600 --> 01:39:46,560
itself

2868
01:39:46,560 --> 01:39:49,040
nor are they super spreaders

2869
01:39:49,040 --> 01:39:51,119
schools were not the source of community

2870
01:39:51,119 --> 01:39:53,760
spread communities spread spread

2871
01:39:53,760 --> 01:39:55,360
the disease to schools not the other way

2872
01:39:55,360 --> 01:39:57,280
around

2873
01:39:57,280 --> 01:39:58,320
um and if we can talk about the

2874
01:39:58,320 --> 01:39:59,840
scientific basis of that if you'd like

2875
01:39:59,840 --> 01:40:02,080
but that was pretty well known even in

2876
01:40:02,080 --> 01:40:03,119
october

2877
01:40:03,119 --> 01:40:05,679
um it that we we closed hospitals in

2878
01:40:05,679 --> 01:40:07,440
order to keep them

2879
01:40:07,440 --> 01:40:09,840
like available to covet patients but as

2880
01:40:09,840 --> 01:40:10,960
a result

2881
01:40:10,960 --> 01:40:14,080
women skipped breast cancer screening

2882
01:40:14,080 --> 01:40:15,679
as a result they have are showing up

2883
01:40:15,679 --> 01:40:16,400
with

2884
01:40:16,400 --> 01:40:17,600
late stage breast cancer that should

2885
01:40:17,600 --> 01:40:19,520
have been picked up last year

2886
01:40:19,520 --> 01:40:21,199
men and women skipped colon cancer

2887
01:40:21,199 --> 01:40:23,520
screening again with later stage disease

2888
01:40:23,520 --> 01:40:24,560
that should have been picked up last

2889
01:40:24,560 --> 01:40:26,639
year with earlier stage for patients

2890
01:40:26,639 --> 01:40:28,880
with diabetes

2891
01:40:28,880 --> 01:40:30,400
it's very important to have regular

2892
01:40:30,400 --> 01:40:33,119
screening for blood sugar levels

2893
01:40:33,119 --> 01:40:35,760
and and sort of counseling for lifestyle

2894
01:40:35,760 --> 01:40:38,080
improvement and we skipped that

2895
01:40:38,080 --> 01:40:39,600
people stayed home with heart attacks

2896
01:40:39,600 --> 01:40:43,280
and died at home with heart attacks

2897
01:40:43,280 --> 01:40:45,600
so you had this like sort of wide range

2898
01:40:45,600 --> 01:40:47,280
of medical

2899
01:40:47,280 --> 01:40:49,600
and psychological harms

2900
01:40:49,600 --> 01:40:51,760
that were being utterly ignored

2901
01:40:51,760 --> 01:40:53,840
as a result of the lockdowns

2902
01:40:53,840 --> 01:40:57,199
plus there's the economic pain

2903
01:40:57,199 --> 01:40:59,360
so like you said the

2904
01:40:59,360 --> 01:41:00,679
whatever is a good term for the

2905
01:41:00,679 --> 01:41:03,199
non-laptop class

2906
01:41:03,199 --> 01:41:05,440
people would lose their jobs yes there

2907
01:41:05,440 --> 01:41:07,119
might be in the in the western world

2908
01:41:07,119 --> 01:41:08,719
support for them

2909
01:41:08,719 --> 01:41:11,360
financially but the the big loss there

2910
01:41:11,360 --> 01:41:13,679
that is perhaps correlated with the

2911
01:41:13,679 --> 01:41:16,560
depression and suicide is uh

2912
01:41:16,560 --> 01:41:18,719
loss of meaning loss of hope for the

2913
01:41:18,719 --> 01:41:21,760
future a loss of kind of a sense of

2914
01:41:21,760 --> 01:41:24,239
stability all the pride you have and

2915
01:41:24,239 --> 01:41:27,360
being able to um

2916
01:41:27,520 --> 01:41:28,960
make

2917
01:41:28,960 --> 01:41:31,280
money that allows you to pave your own

2918
01:41:31,280 --> 01:41:32,639
way in the world

2919
01:41:32,639 --> 01:41:34,800
and yes just having less money than

2920
01:41:34,800 --> 01:41:36,880
you're used to so your family your kids

2921
01:41:36,880 --> 01:41:38,239
are suffering all those kinds of things

2922
01:41:38,239 --> 01:41:40,159
and there's a there's again an economics

2923
01:41:40,159 --> 01:41:42,639
literature on this on deaths of despair

2924
01:41:42,639 --> 01:41:45,040
it was called 2009 there was the the

2925
01:41:45,040 --> 01:41:47,440
great recession it led to an enormous

2926
01:41:47,440 --> 01:41:50,320
uptick in overdose from drugs

2927
01:41:50,320 --> 01:41:53,280
uh suicidality depression

2928
01:41:53,280 --> 01:41:55,119
as a result of the job losses that

2929
01:41:55,119 --> 01:41:57,360
happened during the great recession

2930
01:41:57,360 --> 01:41:59,360
well that's happening again like an

2931
01:41:59,360 --> 01:42:01,040
enormous increase

2932
01:42:01,040 --> 01:42:03,920
in drug overdoses

2933
01:42:03,920 --> 01:42:06,400
that's not uh that's not a an accident

2934
01:42:06,400 --> 01:42:08,320
that's a lockdown harm right same same

2935
01:42:08,320 --> 01:42:10,480
thing with uh with the job losses the

2936
01:42:10,480 --> 01:42:12,239
job losses by the way are like it's so

2937
01:42:12,239 --> 01:42:14,639
interesting because the um the states

2938
01:42:14,639 --> 01:42:16,480
that stayed open have had

2939
01:42:16,480 --> 01:42:18,560
much much lower unemployment than the

2940
01:42:18,560 --> 01:42:20,239
states that stayed closed

2941
01:42:20,239 --> 01:42:22,320
uh the labor force participation rates

2942
01:42:22,320 --> 01:42:24,080
declined by three percent it's women

2943
01:42:24,080 --> 01:42:26,159
that separated because

2944
01:42:26,159 --> 01:42:28,400
they stayed home with their kids um

2945
01:42:28,400 --> 01:42:31,920
we've reversed a generation of women uh

2946
01:42:31,920 --> 01:42:33,679
when

2947
01:42:33,679 --> 01:42:35,440
proving women's participation in the

2948
01:42:35,440 --> 01:42:36,960
labor force

2949
01:42:36,960 --> 01:42:39,119
do you think

2950
01:42:39,119 --> 01:42:41,840
it has to do with institutions that

2951
01:42:41,840 --> 01:42:43,280
we mentioned that there is so much

2952
01:42:43,280 --> 01:42:45,920
priority given or so much power given to

2953
01:42:45,920 --> 01:42:48,239
maybe nih

2954
01:42:48,239 --> 01:42:49,920
versus um

2955
01:42:49,920 --> 01:42:52,800
other civilian leaders or do people just

2956
01:42:52,800 --> 01:42:54,480
not care about the economic pain the

2957
01:42:54,480 --> 01:42:57,920
leaders i mean uh because to me it was

2958
01:42:57,920 --> 01:42:59,199
obvious

2959
01:42:59,199 --> 01:43:01,920
i mean probably it's just studying

2960
01:43:01,920 --> 01:43:03,440
history

2961
01:43:03,440 --> 01:43:06,400
whenever i listen to people on twitter

2962
01:43:06,400 --> 01:43:10,880
on mainstream news or just anything

2963
01:43:10,880 --> 01:43:14,239
i realize that's the very kind of top

2964
01:43:14,239 --> 01:43:17,199
the the people that have a voice

2965
01:43:17,199 --> 01:43:19,600
represent a tiny selection of people and

2966
01:43:19,600 --> 01:43:22,400
so whenever there's hard times i always

2967
01:43:22,400 --> 01:43:25,600
kind of think about the the quiet

2968
01:43:25,600 --> 01:43:27,119
the voiceless

2969
01:43:27,119 --> 01:43:29,440
the quiet suffering of the tens of

2970
01:43:29,440 --> 01:43:32,159
millions of the hundreds of millions

2971
01:43:32,159 --> 01:43:33,679
um

2972
01:43:33,679 --> 01:43:35,760
do the political leaders not just give a

2973
01:43:35,760 --> 01:43:37,760
damn i mean i think it was actually a

2974
01:43:37,760 --> 01:43:40,080
very odd ethical thing at the beginning

2975
01:43:40,080 --> 01:43:42,320
of the pandemic where if you brought up

2976
01:43:42,320 --> 01:43:44,159
economic harms at all

2977
01:43:44,159 --> 01:43:47,280
you were seen as callous

2978
01:43:47,280 --> 01:43:49,840
right so i i i had a reporter calling me

2979
01:43:49,840 --> 01:43:51,040
up almost the very beginning of the

2980
01:43:51,040 --> 01:43:53,520
epidemic asking me about about the about

2981
01:43:53,520 --> 01:43:54,320
uh

2982
01:43:54,320 --> 01:43:55,280
uh

2983
01:43:55,280 --> 01:43:57,040
like a very particular phenomenon so

2984
01:43:57,040 --> 01:43:59,920
like uh he he was anticipating a rise in

2985
01:43:59,920 --> 01:44:01,440
child abuse because children were gonna

2986
01:44:01,440 --> 01:44:02,719
be staying at home child abuse is

2987
01:44:02,719 --> 01:44:04,880
generally picked up at school

2988
01:44:04,880 --> 01:44:06,239
and that actually happened like so like

2989
01:44:06,239 --> 01:44:08,000
the the child reported child abuse

2990
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:10,719
dropped but actual child abuse increased

2991
01:44:10,719 --> 01:44:11,679
um

2992
01:44:11,679 --> 01:44:13,360
because normally you pick up the child

2993
01:44:13,360 --> 01:44:14,880
abuse at school and that you apparently

2994
01:44:14,880 --> 01:44:16,800
you have the intervention right so yeah

2995
01:44:16,800 --> 01:44:18,080
so i was talking about like well there's

2996
01:44:18,080 --> 01:44:19,199
gonna be some economic harms and they're

2997
01:44:19,199 --> 01:44:20,159
going to have health consequences but

2998
01:44:20,159 --> 01:44:22,800
the economic harms matter but the but

2999
01:44:22,800 --> 01:44:25,440
he's he he counseled me and i think he

3000
01:44:25,440 --> 01:44:27,119
was he had his bet my best interest at

3001
01:44:27,119 --> 01:44:28,719
heart like if if we were to put that in

3002
01:44:28,719 --> 01:44:30,719
the story i would be i'd essentially be

3003
01:44:30,719 --> 01:44:32,800
canceled because the what the what the

3004
01:44:32,800 --> 01:44:35,440
uh the the narrative that that arose in

3005
01:44:35,440 --> 01:44:37,679
march of 2020 is if you if you care

3006
01:44:37,679 --> 01:44:39,600
about money at all

3007
01:44:39,600 --> 01:44:41,600
you're evil and crass if you you must

3008
01:44:41,600 --> 01:44:43,760
only care about lives

3009
01:44:43,760 --> 01:44:45,520
the problem with that narrative is that

3010
01:44:45,520 --> 01:44:47,920
that money which we're talking about is

3011
01:44:47,920 --> 01:44:51,199
is actually lives of poor people

3012
01:44:51,199 --> 01:44:53,920
right when you throw 100 million people

3013
01:44:53,920 --> 01:44:55,920
around the world into into poverty

3014
01:44:55,920 --> 01:44:58,080
you're going to see enormous harm to

3015
01:44:58,080 --> 01:45:00,080
their health enormous increases in their

3016
01:45:00,080 --> 01:45:02,320
in their mortality it's not immoral to

3017
01:45:02,320 --> 01:45:04,000
think about that and and worry about

3018
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:04,880
that

3019
01:45:04,880 --> 01:45:07,199
in the context of this pandemic response

3020
01:45:07,199 --> 01:45:10,320
our mind focused so much on kovid that

3021
01:45:10,320 --> 01:45:12,080
it forgot that there are so many other

3022
01:45:12,080 --> 01:45:13,600
public health priorities as well that

3023
01:45:13,600 --> 01:45:16,639
need our attention desperately and this

3024
01:45:16,639 --> 01:45:19,199
is the thing i

3025
01:45:19,199 --> 01:45:21,360
sensed about san francisco when i

3026
01:45:21,360 --> 01:45:22,960
visited i was thinking of moving there

3027
01:45:22,960 --> 01:45:24,480
for startup

3028
01:45:24,480 --> 01:45:26,480
this is the thing i'm really afraid of

3029
01:45:26,480 --> 01:45:29,440
especially if i have any

3030
01:45:29,440 --> 01:45:31,760
effect on the world through a startup is

3031
01:45:31,760 --> 01:45:34,320
losing touch in this kind of way

3032
01:45:34,320 --> 01:45:37,280
that uh you mentioned the laptop class

3033
01:45:37,280 --> 01:45:38,080
um

3034
01:45:38,080 --> 01:45:39,679
living in this world where you're only

3035
01:45:39,679 --> 01:45:42,159
concerned about this particular

3036
01:45:42,159 --> 01:45:45,600
of class of people and also

3037
01:45:45,600 --> 01:45:48,159
uh you know perhaps in early on in the

3038
01:45:48,159 --> 01:45:50,080
pandemic amongst the laptop class there

3039
01:45:50,080 --> 01:45:52,080
was a legitimate concern for health like

3040
01:45:52,080 --> 01:45:53,600
you're not sure

3041
01:45:53,600 --> 01:45:55,840
how deadly this virus is you don't

3042
01:45:55,840 --> 01:45:57,280
you're not sure who to listen to so

3043
01:45:57,280 --> 01:45:58,800
there's a real concern

3044
01:45:58,800 --> 01:46:00,480
and then at a certain point when the

3045
01:46:00,480 --> 01:46:03,360
data starts coming in you start becoming

3046
01:46:03,360 --> 01:46:05,119
more and more detached from the data you

3047
01:46:05,119 --> 01:46:07,199
don't start carrying less and less and

3048
01:46:07,199 --> 01:46:08,639
you start just

3049
01:46:08,639 --> 01:46:10,880
swimming in the space of narratives like

3050
01:46:10,880 --> 01:46:12,480
existing the space of narratives and you

3051
01:46:12,480 --> 01:46:13,840
have this narrative

3052
01:46:13,840 --> 01:46:16,880
in san francisco in the laptop class

3053
01:46:16,880 --> 01:46:20,159
that you just are very uh proud that you

3054
01:46:20,159 --> 01:46:21,679
know the truth you're the sole

3055
01:46:21,679 --> 01:46:23,679
possessors of the truth you congratulate

3056
01:46:23,679 --> 01:46:26,159
yourself on it and you don't care what

3057
01:46:26,159 --> 01:46:27,280
actually

3058
01:46:27,280 --> 01:46:29,119
gigantic detrimental effect it has on

3059
01:46:29,119 --> 01:46:30,639
society because

3060
01:46:30,639 --> 01:46:32,320
you're mostly

3061
01:46:32,320 --> 01:46:33,920
fine

3062
01:46:33,920 --> 01:46:36,639
that i'm so terrified of that

3063
01:46:36,639 --> 01:46:38,639
well i think the answer to that is just

3064
01:46:38,639 --> 01:46:39,600
to

3065
01:46:39,600 --> 01:46:40,480
you remember

3066
01:46:40,480 --> 01:46:41,760
yeah yeah

3067
01:46:41,760 --> 01:46:43,280
i don't think um you know remember where

3068
01:46:43,280 --> 01:46:45,119
you came from remember who who who

3069
01:46:45,119 --> 01:46:47,040
you're doing is for at the back of your

3070
01:46:47,040 --> 01:46:48,719
head should always be what's what's the

3071
01:46:48,719 --> 01:46:50,960
purpose like why am i here what's the

3072
01:46:50,960 --> 01:46:53,040
purpose of this and if i'm if if the

3073
01:46:53,040 --> 01:46:55,400
purpose is simply

3074
01:46:55,400 --> 01:46:57,119
self-aggrandizement then you should

3075
01:46:57,119 --> 01:46:58,880
rethink because it'll just end up being

3076
01:46:58,880 --> 01:47:01,040
a hall of life

3077
01:47:01,040 --> 01:47:04,800
all of us will be forgotten in the end

3078
01:47:04,800 --> 01:47:06,560
focus protection

3079
01:47:06,560 --> 01:47:09,040
the idea the policy what is focus

3080
01:47:09,040 --> 01:47:10,960
protection right so those i was saying

3081
01:47:10,960 --> 01:47:13,040
that there's two scientific bases right

3082
01:47:13,040 --> 01:47:15,040
so one is this the steep age gradient

3083
01:47:15,040 --> 01:47:16,719
the second is the existence of locked

3084
01:47:16,719 --> 01:47:18,159
arms again i think there's not very

3085
01:47:18,159 --> 01:47:19,600
little disagreement in the scientific

3086
01:47:19,600 --> 01:47:22,239
community of both of those facts

3087
01:47:22,239 --> 01:47:24,560
if you put those facts together

3088
01:47:24,560 --> 01:47:27,360
the obvious policy is to protect the

3089
01:47:27,360 --> 01:47:29,440
people who are at the most severe risk

3090
01:47:29,440 --> 01:47:31,520
from the disease itself

3091
01:47:31,520 --> 01:47:32,960
and that's the idea of focus protection

3092
01:47:32,960 --> 01:47:35,119
that's the general principle of it

3093
01:47:35,119 --> 01:47:37,840
the actual implementation of it depends

3094
01:47:37,840 --> 01:47:39,840
on the living circumstances of the

3095
01:47:39,840 --> 01:47:41,520
people that are at risk

3096
01:47:41,520 --> 01:47:42,960
the resources are available in the

3097
01:47:42,960 --> 01:47:46,480
community uh the the uh the technology

3098
01:47:46,480 --> 01:47:49,280
is available to do this

3099
01:47:49,280 --> 01:47:51,840
and so it's almost always going to be in

3100
01:47:51,840 --> 01:47:54,719
fact it'll always be a local thing

3101
01:47:54,719 --> 01:47:57,199
because it'll depend on the the the all

3102
01:47:57,199 --> 01:47:58,639
of those those things which are all

3103
01:47:58,639 --> 01:48:00,159
local in nature

3104
01:48:00,159 --> 01:48:03,360
right so one very very obvious thing in

3105
01:48:03,360 --> 01:48:05,920
a country like ours where so many older

3106
01:48:05,920 --> 01:48:07,679
people live in institutionalized

3107
01:48:07,679 --> 01:48:10,400
settings in nursing home settings

3108
01:48:10,400 --> 01:48:12,960
and that's where older really vulnerable

3109
01:48:12,960 --> 01:48:15,679
chronically ill patients often live

3110
01:48:15,679 --> 01:48:17,679
it is and you know this disease affects

3111
01:48:17,679 --> 01:48:19,760
that group most like most most commonly

3112
01:48:19,760 --> 01:48:21,920
it is absolutely vital to protect that

3113
01:48:21,920 --> 01:48:23,119
group

3114
01:48:23,119 --> 01:48:25,679
um we should have known that in february

3115
01:48:25,679 --> 01:48:29,760
2020 from just from the chinese data

3116
01:48:30,159 --> 01:48:30,880
and

3117
01:48:30,880 --> 01:48:33,119
we should have thought about that group

3118
01:48:33,119 --> 01:48:36,239
as the as this as the key constraint

3119
01:48:36,239 --> 01:48:38,239
in our policy making

3120
01:48:38,239 --> 01:48:40,719
um instead we thought about in february

3121
01:48:40,719 --> 01:48:43,600
march 2020 as hospital beds as the key

3122
01:48:43,600 --> 01:48:44,800
constraint

3123
01:48:44,800 --> 01:48:46,800
hospital beds and ventilator shortages

3124
01:48:46,800 --> 01:48:49,040
and that we so we we ran around trying

3125
01:48:49,040 --> 01:48:51,119
to like address that

3126
01:48:51,119 --> 01:48:52,800
constraint you know like a linear

3127
01:48:52,800 --> 01:48:53,920
programming problem you figure out what

3128
01:48:53,920 --> 01:48:55,440
the which constraints binding and you

3129
01:48:55,440 --> 01:48:56,800
address that one thing and then you go

3130
01:48:56,800 --> 01:48:59,520
to the next one right um if that's it's

3131
01:48:59,520 --> 01:49:01,199
that one constraint we said okay the

3132
01:49:01,199 --> 01:49:04,239
constraint is hospital beds

3133
01:49:04,239 --> 01:49:07,119
that led to the decision in many of the

3134
01:49:07,119 --> 01:49:09,600
northeast states to send

3135
01:49:09,600 --> 01:49:11,600
covet infected patients who were on on

3136
01:49:11,600 --> 01:49:13,119
the verge of like it looked like they

3137
01:49:13,119 --> 01:49:15,280
were about to recover back to nursing

3138
01:49:15,280 --> 01:49:17,199
homes

3139
01:49:17,199 --> 01:49:18,960
who then spread the disease all through

3140
01:49:18,960 --> 01:49:20,080
there because they wanted to preserve

3141
01:49:20,080 --> 01:49:21,760
the hospital beds

3142
01:49:21,760 --> 01:49:24,320
well for somebody who loves the miracle

3143
01:49:24,320 --> 01:49:26,080
optimization i love the way you frame

3144
01:49:26,080 --> 01:49:27,840
this

3145
01:49:27,840 --> 01:49:30,400
but those are kind of connected right if

3146
01:49:30,400 --> 01:49:32,560
you actually focus on protecting the

3147
01:49:32,560 --> 01:49:35,360
vulnerable you will also

3148
01:49:35,360 --> 01:49:37,440
have the effect of

3149
01:49:37,440 --> 01:49:38,239
not

3150
01:49:38,239 --> 01:49:40,400
hitting the ceiling of the available

3151
01:49:40,400 --> 01:49:42,639
that is that's the irony if we protected

3152
01:49:42,639 --> 01:49:45,199
the vulnerable the vulnerable the most

3153
01:49:45,199 --> 01:49:47,520
likely to be hospitalized and so by

3154
01:49:47,520 --> 01:49:49,280
protecting the hospital about protecting

3155
01:49:49,280 --> 01:49:51,520
the vulnerable we would also have

3156
01:49:51,520 --> 01:49:52,719
addressed the shortage of hospital

3157
01:49:52,719 --> 01:49:54,560
that's more effectively so that little

3158
01:49:54,560 --> 01:49:56,560
shift in priority would have had a big

3159
01:49:56,560 --> 01:49:57,599
impact

3160
01:49:57,599 --> 01:50:01,599
okay but specifically the idea is to

3161
01:50:01,599 --> 01:50:03,520
and we could talk about different ideas

3162
01:50:03,520 --> 01:50:05,679
of how to actually do this but uh you

3163
01:50:05,679 --> 01:50:07,360
know you

3164
01:50:07,360 --> 01:50:09,440
basically do a lockdown or something

3165
01:50:09,440 --> 01:50:12,400
like that on a very small set i mean you

3166
01:50:12,400 --> 01:50:14,000
may have to do that if it's community

3167
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:15,520
spread is very high but generally i

3168
01:50:15,520 --> 01:50:17,199
think

3169
01:50:17,199 --> 01:50:18,719
it would depend on again the living

3170
01:50:18,719 --> 01:50:20,560
circumstances and the uh so so for

3171
01:50:20,560 --> 01:50:22,239
instance um

3172
01:50:22,239 --> 01:50:24,639
if you are in a if you have a here's a

3173
01:50:24,639 --> 01:50:26,000
very simple idea that doesn't require a

3174
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:27,440
lockdown

3175
01:50:27,440 --> 01:50:28,880
forced on them i i don't actually

3176
01:50:28,880 --> 01:50:30,239
generally are not in favor of that kind

3177
01:50:30,239 --> 01:50:31,520
of force lockdown because you just won't

3178
01:50:31,520 --> 01:50:33,360
get cooperation

3179
01:50:33,360 --> 01:50:35,040
um but what you could do is provide

3180
01:50:35,040 --> 01:50:36,960
resources to

3181
01:50:36,960 --> 01:50:39,119
that group of people so like ima imagine

3182
01:50:39,119 --> 01:50:41,520
you live next door to somebody uh an

3183
01:50:41,520 --> 01:50:43,199
older couple

3184
01:50:43,199 --> 01:50:44,960
um and it's there's high community

3185
01:50:44,960 --> 01:50:46,239
spread

3186
01:50:46,239 --> 01:50:48,480
well they have to go grocery shopping

3187
01:50:48,480 --> 01:50:50,080
um we did like some of these some

3188
01:50:50,080 --> 01:50:51,840
communities did these like senior only

3189
01:50:51,840 --> 01:50:54,159
grocery hour right but but they have to

3190
01:50:54,159 --> 01:50:55,679
still have to go out and they might get

3191
01:50:55,679 --> 01:50:57,760
exposed in when they're shopping amongst

3192
01:50:57,760 --> 01:50:59,440
other seniors yeah

3193
01:50:59,440 --> 01:51:02,000
well why not organized home delivery of

3194
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:04,000
groceries to them we did that for the

3195
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:05,679
laptop class

3196
01:51:05,679 --> 01:51:07,679
right uh or or you can even just there's

3197
01:51:07,679 --> 01:51:09,280
a volunteer effort you know the older

3198
01:51:09,280 --> 01:51:10,639
people living next door just call them

3199
01:51:10,639 --> 01:51:12,560
up and say can i help you get uh go out

3200
01:51:12,560 --> 01:51:14,159
and go shopping for it and so you would

3201
01:51:14,159 --> 01:51:15,599
have potentially

3202
01:51:15,599 --> 01:51:17,520
federal support of that kind of thing so

3203
01:51:17,520 --> 01:51:20,080
these kinds of efforts and identify

3204
01:51:20,080 --> 01:51:22,239
where the vulnerable people live uh it's

3205
01:51:22,239 --> 01:51:24,159
really challenging in multi-generational

3206
01:51:24,159 --> 01:51:25,599
homes in l.a county for instance there's

3207
01:51:25,599 --> 01:51:27,520
a lot of

3208
01:51:27,520 --> 01:51:28,800
older people living together with

3209
01:51:28,800 --> 01:51:31,520
younger people in relatively crowded

3210
01:51:31,520 --> 01:51:33,360
they're they're it's really quite a

3211
01:51:33,360 --> 01:51:35,040
challenge but there again you can use

3212
01:51:35,040 --> 01:51:38,400
resources so if grandma uh

3213
01:51:38,400 --> 01:51:40,639
is worried that grandson has come home

3214
01:51:40,639 --> 01:51:42,239
but is potentially been exposed grandson

3215
01:51:42,239 --> 01:51:43,760
calls grandma says i've been i might

3216
01:51:43,760 --> 01:51:45,199
have been at a party where i might do

3217
01:51:45,199 --> 01:51:47,679
that where covid was grandma calls

3218
01:51:47,679 --> 01:51:49,040
public health public health and then

3219
01:51:49,040 --> 01:51:50,560
says okay you can have this hotel room

3220
01:51:50,560 --> 01:51:51,840
for a couple of days

3221
01:51:51,840 --> 01:51:54,400
until you check to turn negatives in

3222
01:51:54,400 --> 01:51:56,000
case it wasn't clear

3223
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:58,560
the idea of focus protection

3224
01:51:58,560 --> 01:52:00,840
is the people that are

3225
01:52:00,840 --> 01:52:02,960
vulnerable protect them

3226
01:52:02,960 --> 01:52:05,199
and everybody else goes on with their

3227
01:52:05,199 --> 01:52:08,639
lives open up the economy just do as it

3228
01:52:08,639 --> 01:52:10,480
was before and there was still fear

3229
01:52:10,480 --> 01:52:12,159
abroad so there still would be some

3230
01:52:12,159 --> 01:52:13,520
restrictions people would pose on

3231
01:52:13,520 --> 01:52:15,040
themselves they probably would go to

3232
01:52:15,040 --> 01:52:16,560
parties less the grandsons probably

3233
01:52:16,560 --> 01:52:18,880
wouldn't go so many parties right um uh

3234
01:52:18,880 --> 01:52:20,560
that there would be less

3235
01:52:20,560 --> 01:52:23,360
less participation in big gatherings uh

3236
01:52:23,360 --> 01:52:25,119
you may even save like big gatherings in

3237
01:52:25,119 --> 01:52:27,280
order to restrict community spread again

3238
01:52:27,280 --> 01:52:29,280
i'm not against any of that

3239
01:52:29,280 --> 01:52:31,679
but you shouldn't be closing businesses

3240
01:52:31,679 --> 01:52:33,280
you shouldn't be closing churches and

3241
01:52:33,280 --> 01:52:35,040
synagogues you shouldn't be closing you

3242
01:52:35,040 --> 01:52:37,760
shouldn't be forcing people to not go to

3243
01:52:37,760 --> 01:52:39,280
to school you should

3244
01:52:39,280 --> 01:52:41,199
you should not be shuttering businesses

3245
01:52:41,199 --> 01:52:42,480
you should just let

3246
01:52:42,480 --> 01:52:44,960
just allow society to go on some disease

3247
01:52:44,960 --> 01:52:46,880
will spread but as we've seen the

3248
01:52:46,880 --> 01:52:48,159
lockdown didn't stop the disease from

3249
01:52:48,159 --> 01:52:50,000
spreading anyways

3250
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:51,840
right so what do you make of the

3251
01:52:51,840 --> 01:52:55,760
criticism that this idea like

3252
01:52:55,760 --> 01:52:57,520
all good ideas

3253
01:52:57,520 --> 01:52:59,840
cannot actually be implemented in a

3254
01:52:59,840 --> 01:53:01,679
heterogeneous society where there's a

3255
01:53:01,679 --> 01:53:03,599
lot of people intermixing

3256
01:53:03,599 --> 01:53:04,560
and

3257
01:53:04,560 --> 01:53:07,599
once you open it up people like the the

3258
01:53:07,599 --> 01:53:09,360
younger people will just forget that

3259
01:53:09,360 --> 01:53:11,679
this is even existing and they'll stop

3260
01:53:11,679 --> 01:53:13,280
caring about the older people and mess

3261
01:53:13,280 --> 01:53:15,040
up the whole thing and the government

3262
01:53:15,040 --> 01:53:16,719
will not want to fund

3263
01:53:16,719 --> 01:53:18,239
any kind of the great efforts you're

3264
01:53:18,239 --> 01:53:19,920
talking about about food delivery and

3265
01:53:19,920 --> 01:53:22,159
then the food delivery services be like

3266
01:53:22,159 --> 01:53:23,920
why the heck am i helping out on this

3267
01:53:23,920 --> 01:53:25,920
anyway because like it's not making me

3268
01:53:25,920 --> 01:53:28,080
much money and so therefore like all

3269
01:53:28,080 --> 01:53:30,400
good ideas it will collapse

3270
01:53:30,400 --> 01:53:32,239
that might be true i mean i think it's

3271
01:53:32,239 --> 01:53:34,080
always a risk with policy thing but i

3272
01:53:34,080 --> 01:53:37,280
think like think back to the moment

3273
01:53:37,280 --> 01:53:38,560
we actually felt like we were in this

3274
01:53:38,560 --> 01:53:40,719
together to some extent yes

3275
01:53:40,719 --> 01:53:43,280
right i think i think that that um that

3276
01:53:43,280 --> 01:53:45,280
empathy that we had that was used to

3277
01:53:45,280 --> 01:53:47,520
like

3278
01:53:47,520 --> 01:53:50,080
tell people to stay in and like happily

3279
01:53:50,080 --> 01:53:51,760
not don't rule in happily but like stay

3280
01:53:51,760 --> 01:53:52,639
in

3281
01:53:52,639 --> 01:53:55,520
um to to like wear a mask or to to do

3282
01:53:55,520 --> 01:53:57,280
all these things that we thought would

3283
01:53:57,280 --> 01:53:58,719
help other people

3284
01:53:58,719 --> 01:54:00,400
could have been redirected to actually

3285
01:54:00,400 --> 01:54:02,800
helping the people who most needed to be

3286
01:54:02,800 --> 01:54:04,000
especially

3287
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:04,870
i do remember

3288
01:54:04,870 --> 01:54:06,840
[Music]

3289
01:54:06,840 --> 01:54:09,840
march uh so this is even way before

3290
01:54:09,840 --> 01:54:12,639
barrington all that kind of stuff

3291
01:54:12,639 --> 01:54:14,719
march april may

3292
01:54:14,719 --> 01:54:17,040
there was a feeling like if if we all

3293
01:54:17,040 --> 01:54:18,639
just work together

3294
01:54:18,639 --> 01:54:21,119
yeah we'll solve this right and that

3295
01:54:21,119 --> 01:54:23,280
maybe started to when did that start

3296
01:54:23,280 --> 01:54:25,280
breaking down i mean the

3297
01:54:25,280 --> 01:54:27,599
unfortunately the election is mixed into

3298
01:54:27,599 --> 01:54:30,960
this yeah that it became politicized but

3299
01:54:30,960 --> 01:54:32,880
i think it lasted quite a long time i

3300
01:54:32,880 --> 01:54:34,400
think into the summer i think there was

3301
01:54:34,400 --> 01:54:37,040
some some of that sense uh i don't know

3302
01:54:37,040 --> 01:54:38,400
they're obviously varied among different

3303
01:54:38,400 --> 01:54:39,679
people but um

3304
01:54:39,679 --> 01:54:41,599
but i think that it's true it would have

3305
01:54:41,599 --> 01:54:43,360
been challenging it's also true that

3306
01:54:43,360 --> 01:54:45,599
it's heterogeneous exactly the way you

3307
01:54:45,599 --> 01:54:47,920
said um but what that means is you need

3308
01:54:47,920 --> 01:54:49,760
a local response

3309
01:54:49,760 --> 01:54:52,400
a response so like like my vision of a

3310
01:54:52,400 --> 01:54:54,000
public health officer is someone that

3311
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:56,480
understands their community

3312
01:54:56,480 --> 01:54:58,159
not not necessarily the nation at large

3313
01:54:58,159 --> 01:55:00,239
but their community and then works

3314
01:55:00,239 --> 01:55:02,000
within their community to figure out how

3315
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:03,599
to deploy the resources that have

3316
01:55:03,599 --> 01:55:05,040
available

3317
01:55:05,040 --> 01:55:07,360
um to do the kind of protection policies

3318
01:55:07,360 --> 01:55:08,800
we're talking about that's that's what

3319
01:55:08,800 --> 01:55:10,960
should have happened instead they spent

3320
01:55:10,960 --> 01:55:13,360
a huge amount of efforts closing making

3321
01:55:13,360 --> 01:55:15,440
sure businesses stayed closed

3322
01:55:15,440 --> 01:55:16,800
businesses that

3323
01:55:16,800 --> 01:55:18,880
i mean there were you know like hardware

3324
01:55:18,880 --> 01:55:20,719
stores that closed

3325
01:55:20,719 --> 01:55:22,480
what good did closing a hardware store

3326
01:55:22,480 --> 01:55:23,840
do

3327
01:55:23,840 --> 01:55:25,440
for the spreader club if it had an

3328
01:55:25,440 --> 01:55:27,280
effect on spread covert spread i mean

3329
01:55:27,280 --> 01:55:28,800
it's going to be checking to make sure

3330
01:55:28,800 --> 01:55:30,960
that plexiglas was put up everywhere

3331
01:55:30,960 --> 01:55:32,480
which now in retrospect turns out to

3332
01:55:32,480 --> 01:55:35,440
have probably made the disease worse

3333
01:55:35,440 --> 01:55:36,880
um

3334
01:55:36,880 --> 01:55:38,960
you know masking enforcement

3335
01:55:38,960 --> 01:55:41,040
so shaming around mask i mean a huge

3336
01:55:41,040 --> 01:55:43,840
amount of effort on things that were

3337
01:55:43,840 --> 01:55:46,080
only tangentially related to focus

3338
01:55:46,080 --> 01:55:49,119
protection what if we turned our energy

3339
01:55:49,119 --> 01:55:52,159
that enormous energy put into that

3340
01:55:52,159 --> 01:55:53,840
instead into focused protection of the

3341
01:55:53,840 --> 01:55:55,119
vulnerable that's essentially the

3342
01:55:55,119 --> 01:55:56,960
conversation i was calling for

3343
01:55:56,960 --> 01:55:59,119
and it wasn't i mean i didn't think of

3344
01:55:59,119 --> 01:56:01,040
it as we had every single idea i mean we

3345
01:56:01,040 --> 01:56:03,040
gave some concrete proposals

3346
01:56:03,040 --> 01:56:04,560
and we got but the criticism we got was

3347
01:56:04,560 --> 01:56:06,080
that those those concrete proposals

3348
01:56:06,080 --> 01:56:08,000
weren't enough

3349
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:09,840
and the answer to that i have is that's

3350
01:56:09,840 --> 01:56:11,440
true they weren't enough i wasn't

3351
01:56:11,440 --> 01:56:12,719
thinking of them as enough i was

3352
01:56:12,719 --> 01:56:14,480
thinking that they would i wanted to

3353
01:56:14,480 --> 01:56:16,560
involve an enormous number of people in

3354
01:56:16,560 --> 01:56:19,440
local public health to help think about

3355
01:56:19,440 --> 01:56:21,199
how to do focus protection in their

3356
01:56:21,199 --> 01:56:23,199
communities

3357
01:56:23,199 --> 01:56:25,920
the question that's interesting here is

3358
01:56:25,920 --> 01:56:28,880
about the future too

3359
01:56:28,880 --> 01:56:31,760
uh so uh covet has very specific

3360
01:56:31,760 --> 01:56:33,360
characteristics like you mentioned about

3361
01:56:33,360 --> 01:56:36,159
the curve of the the the death rate

3362
01:56:36,159 --> 01:56:38,639
based on the like it's it's uh it seems

3363
01:56:38,639 --> 01:56:40,400
like with covid it's a little bit easier

3364
01:56:40,400 --> 01:56:43,199
to actually identify a group of people

3365
01:56:43,199 --> 01:56:45,520
that you need to protect

3366
01:56:45,520 --> 01:56:49,119
so other viruses may not be this way so

3367
01:56:49,119 --> 01:56:52,320
might lock down be a good idea like hard

3368
01:56:52,320 --> 01:56:55,360
core lockdown for future virus

3369
01:56:55,360 --> 01:56:58,159
that's 10 times deadlier but spreads at

3370
01:56:58,159 --> 01:57:00,480
the same rate as covid or maybe another

3371
01:57:00,480 --> 01:57:02,719
way to ask that is imagine a virus

3372
01:57:02,719 --> 01:57:04,480
that's 10 times deadlier what's the

3373
01:57:04,480 --> 01:57:06,080
right response

3374
01:57:06,080 --> 01:57:07,520
i mean i think it's always going to be

3375
01:57:07,520 --> 01:57:10,080
focus protection but the group that

3376
01:57:10,080 --> 01:57:12,000
needs the focus protection may change

3377
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:14,080
depending on the biology of the virus

3378
01:57:14,080 --> 01:57:15,599
right so the polio

3379
01:57:15,599 --> 01:57:18,480
epidemic in the 40s and 50s in the u.s

3380
01:57:18,480 --> 01:57:21,119
the the great the people at most risk

3381
01:57:21,119 --> 01:57:23,040
were children

3382
01:57:23,040 --> 01:57:24,800
we didn't know really at the beginning

3383
01:57:24,800 --> 01:57:26,880
there was this vehicle oral spread

3384
01:57:26,880 --> 01:57:29,520
and so we did all kinds of crazy things

3385
01:57:29,520 --> 01:57:30,320
um

3386
01:57:30,320 --> 01:57:32,639
including like spreading spraying ddt in

3387
01:57:32,639 --> 01:57:34,159
communities

3388
01:57:34,159 --> 01:57:35,679
which was somehow supposed to get rid of

3389
01:57:35,679 --> 01:57:39,199
polio um but the focus was on whenever

3390
01:57:39,199 --> 01:57:40,480
there was an outbreak they would close a

3391
01:57:40,480 --> 01:57:41,920
school down

3392
01:57:41,920 --> 01:57:43,599
and that was the right thing to do

3393
01:57:43,599 --> 01:57:45,520
because that group that needed

3394
01:57:45,520 --> 01:57:46,800
protection

3395
01:57:46,800 --> 01:57:48,159
where it was

3396
01:57:48,159 --> 01:57:49,840
children and those the disease was

3397
01:57:49,840 --> 01:57:53,440
spread we thought in schools

3398
01:57:53,440 --> 01:57:55,360
i don't think there's a single formula

3399
01:57:55,360 --> 01:57:57,280
that works but there's a single

3400
01:57:57,280 --> 01:58:00,080
principle that works right no matter i

3401
01:58:00,080 --> 01:58:02,080
can't it's hard to imagine a disease

3402
01:58:02,080 --> 01:58:04,960
that's uniformly deadly across every

3403
01:58:04,960 --> 01:58:07,040
group and every single person

3404
01:58:07,040 --> 01:58:09,599
there's always going to be some group

3405
01:58:09,599 --> 01:58:12,239
that's differentially

3406
01:58:12,239 --> 01:58:13,360
harmed

3407
01:58:13,360 --> 01:58:14,639
uh there's always going to be some group

3408
01:58:14,639 --> 01:58:16,480
that's differentially protected and that

3409
01:58:16,480 --> 01:58:18,239
that may change over time right so like

3410
01:58:18,239 --> 01:58:20,560
the in the uh

3411
01:58:20,560 --> 01:58:23,280
in this disease in this epidemic

3412
01:58:23,280 --> 01:58:25,920
as people got infected and recovered we

3413
01:58:25,920 --> 01:58:27,280
now had a class of people that were

3414
01:58:27,280 --> 01:58:28,480
pretty well protected against the

3415
01:58:28,480 --> 01:58:30,880
disease

3416
01:58:30,880 --> 01:58:32,800
they should be they would like instead

3417
01:58:32,800 --> 01:58:34,639
of ostracizing them because they don't

3418
01:58:34,639 --> 01:58:36,719
want a vaccine we should we should be

3419
01:58:36,719 --> 01:58:38,239
allowing them to work i mean we're

3420
01:58:38,239 --> 01:58:39,119
having

3421
01:58:39,119 --> 01:58:41,119
staffing shortages in hospitals now

3422
01:58:41,119 --> 01:58:43,280
because we forgot that principle

3423
01:58:43,280 --> 01:58:44,400
is uh

3424
01:58:44,400 --> 01:58:46,480
quite a bit of this a technology problem

3425
01:58:46,480 --> 01:58:49,840
so being able to so some of it how much

3426
01:58:49,840 --> 01:58:53,520
of it is this uh sociological problem

3427
01:58:53,520 --> 01:58:55,040
uh how much of it is a technology

3428
01:58:55,040 --> 01:58:56,239
problem

3429
01:58:56,239 --> 01:58:58,960
like where do you uh put the blame

3430
01:58:58,960 --> 01:59:01,520
sort of on why this didn't go so great

3431
01:59:01,520 --> 01:59:04,000
and how it can go great in the beginning

3432
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:06,000
i mean think about lockdowns like if we

3433
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:07,440
didn't have zoom we wouldn't have

3434
01:59:07,440 --> 01:59:09,280
lockdowns right there's

3435
01:59:09,280 --> 01:59:11,199
there's a reason in 2009 we didn't lock

3436
01:59:11,199 --> 01:59:12,320
down i mean we didn't have the

3437
01:59:12,320 --> 01:59:13,920
technology to replace work with this

3438
01:59:13,920 --> 01:59:14,880
remote

3439
01:59:14,880 --> 01:59:17,840
um with this remote technology

3440
01:59:17,840 --> 01:59:20,480
so we had good lockdown technology yeah

3441
01:59:20,480 --> 01:59:22,960
and zoom we didn't have

3442
01:59:22,960 --> 01:59:25,440
good focus protection technology yeah i

3443
01:59:25,440 --> 01:59:26,560
mean focus protection is always going to

3444
01:59:26,560 --> 01:59:28,000
be complicated especially for something

3445
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:29,520
like this that's spread so easily it's

3446
01:59:29,520 --> 01:59:32,400
going to be complicated and i'm i'm very

3447
01:59:32,400 --> 01:59:33,760
i'm the last person to say would have

3448
01:59:33,760 --> 01:59:35,760
been perfect there's there would have

3449
01:59:35,760 --> 01:59:37,599
been people that would have gotten sick

3450
01:59:37,599 --> 01:59:39,599
but they got sick anyways the hope was

3451
01:59:39,599 --> 01:59:41,679
that if we suppress community spread low

3452
01:59:41,679 --> 01:59:42,719
enough

3453
01:59:42,719 --> 01:59:44,400
we can protect the vulnerable

3454
01:59:44,400 --> 01:59:47,040
that was the hope by lockdown

3455
01:59:47,040 --> 01:59:48,960
the reality was that

3456
01:59:48,960 --> 01:59:50,639
only a certain class of people were able

3457
01:59:50,639 --> 01:59:52,080
to benefit from a lockdown the rest of

3458
01:59:52,080 --> 01:59:53,679
society we call them essential workers

3459
01:59:53,679 --> 01:59:55,679
had to keep working and they got sick

3460
01:59:55,679 --> 01:59:56,480
yeah

3461
01:59:56,480 --> 01:59:58,560
and the disease kept spreading it didn't

3462
01:59:58,560 --> 02:00:00,320
actually have a substantial effect on

3463
02:00:00,320 --> 02:00:03,440
community spread in the in in non

3464
02:00:03,440 --> 02:00:05,840
laptop class populations

3465
02:00:05,840 --> 02:00:07,440
and also we should probably expand the

3466
02:00:07,440 --> 02:00:09,920
class of people who call vulnerable to

3467
02:00:09,920 --> 02:00:12,960
those who would suffer who have the

3468
02:00:12,960 --> 02:00:15,840
capacity to suffer

3469
02:00:15,840 --> 02:00:17,920
given the policies they're you're

3470
02:00:17,920 --> 02:00:18,960
weighing

3471
02:00:18,960 --> 02:00:20,320
it's very

3472
02:00:20,320 --> 02:00:22,880
disingenuous to call the vulnerable just

3473
02:00:22,880 --> 02:00:24,080
the people

3474
02:00:24,080 --> 02:00:25,679
obviously we had the very specific

3475
02:00:25,679 --> 02:00:29,440
meaning but broadly speaking vulnerable

3476
02:00:29,440 --> 02:00:32,639
should uh include anybody who can suffer

3477
02:00:32,639 --> 02:00:34,880
based on the policies you take in

3478
02:00:34,880 --> 02:00:36,400
response to a virus there's something

3479
02:00:36,400 --> 02:00:38,080
this is that principle you just said as

3480
02:00:38,080 --> 02:00:39,760
i completely agree with is is uh

3481
02:00:39,760 --> 02:00:41,840
something i think has been lost

3482
02:00:41,840 --> 02:00:42,639
uh

3483
02:00:42,639 --> 02:00:45,199
and unfortunately lost right so

3484
02:00:45,199 --> 02:00:47,599
the policies themselves

3485
02:00:47,599 --> 02:00:50,639
if they have harm those are real

3486
02:00:50,639 --> 02:00:52,000
yeah and we shouldn't pretend like

3487
02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:53,360
they're not

3488
02:00:53,360 --> 02:00:55,599
and and and essentially demonize the

3489
02:00:55,599 --> 02:00:58,159
people that that that suffer them

3490
02:00:58,159 --> 02:01:00,400
or pretend i mean like us a lot of times

3491
02:01:00,400 --> 02:01:01,840
like the depression that we've been

3492
02:01:01,840 --> 02:01:03,679
talking about that's

3493
02:01:03,679 --> 02:01:05,199
thought of as like not as not so

3494
02:01:05,199 --> 02:01:08,960
important but it is important uh and uh

3495
02:01:08,960 --> 02:01:11,119
uh especially the the harm to the people

3496
02:01:11,119 --> 02:01:13,280
in poor countries it's like been out of

3497
02:01:13,280 --> 02:01:15,440
sight item out of mind in much of the

3498
02:01:15,440 --> 02:01:16,880
rich parts of the world

3499
02:01:16,880 --> 02:01:19,360
once again i've hoped that we

3500
02:01:19,360 --> 02:01:21,199
seeing this learning the lessons of

3501
02:01:21,199 --> 02:01:23,040
history with the communication tools who

3502
02:01:23,040 --> 02:01:24,800
have now will learn this it's like going

3503
02:01:24,800 --> 02:01:27,360
to another country and bombing targeted

3504
02:01:27,360 --> 02:01:29,280
terrorist locations

3505
02:01:29,280 --> 02:01:30,960
and there's going to be some civilians

3506
02:01:30,960 --> 02:01:32,000
who die

3507
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:34,159
pretending that that

3508
02:01:34,159 --> 02:01:37,840
the child who watches their dad die is

3509
02:01:37,840 --> 02:01:39,599
not going to grow up first of all

3510
02:01:39,599 --> 02:01:41,199
traumatized but second of all

3511
02:01:41,199 --> 02:01:43,760
potentially bring more hate to the world

3512
02:01:43,760 --> 02:01:46,400
than uh the hate that you were allegedly

3513
02:01:46,400 --> 02:01:47,679
fighting in the first place that's

3514
02:01:47,679 --> 02:01:49,360
another sort of

3515
02:01:49,360 --> 02:01:52,560
um considering only one kind of harm and

3516
02:01:52,560 --> 02:01:54,159
not the full range of harms that are

3517
02:01:54,159 --> 02:01:56,080
being caused by your policies you know

3518
02:01:56,080 --> 02:01:58,719
like the good return to focus protection

3519
02:01:58,719 --> 02:02:00,239
we we still should be following the

3520
02:02:00,239 --> 02:02:02,719
policy now for covet and we're not

3521
02:02:02,719 --> 02:02:04,880
right so the vaccines

3522
02:02:04,880 --> 02:02:06,719
are there's a great shortage in vaccines

3523
02:02:06,719 --> 02:02:07,920
you wouldn't know it in the united

3524
02:02:07,920 --> 02:02:09,679
states and in rich parts of the world

3525
02:02:09,679 --> 02:02:11,199
but in there's a great shortage of

3526
02:02:11,199 --> 02:02:12,320
vaccines we're not going to be able to

3527
02:02:12,320 --> 02:02:15,440
vaccinate the um most of the like the

3528
02:02:15,440 --> 02:02:18,080
entire set of elderly at least and or

3529
02:02:18,080 --> 02:02:20,960
larger groups until late 2022.

3530
02:02:20,960 --> 02:02:23,679
huge numbers of older people around the

3531
02:02:23,679 --> 02:02:25,840
world in poor countries that have not

3532
02:02:25,840 --> 02:02:27,599
had not covered recovered yet so they're

3533
02:02:27,599 --> 02:02:29,520
still quite vulnerable have not had the

3534
02:02:29,520 --> 02:02:30,719
vaccine

3535
02:02:30,719 --> 02:02:32,080
and yet we're talking about vaccinating

3536
02:02:32,080 --> 02:02:33,360
five-year-olds

3537
02:02:33,360 --> 02:02:34,400
yeah

3538
02:02:34,400 --> 02:02:36,000
who benefit

3539
02:02:36,000 --> 02:02:37,840
if at all from the vaccines of just a

3540
02:02:37,840 --> 02:02:39,360
very little bit because they face such a

3541
02:02:39,360 --> 02:02:42,880
low risk of harm from covid

3542
02:02:42,880 --> 02:02:45,040
well something that's a little bit

3543
02:02:45,040 --> 02:02:47,760
near and dear to our specific the two of

3544
02:02:47,760 --> 02:02:51,199
our hearts uh so you're at stanford

3545
02:02:51,199 --> 02:02:53,119
so stanford recently

3546
02:02:53,119 --> 02:02:54,480
announced that they're going back to

3547
02:02:54,480 --> 02:02:55,599
virtual

3548
02:02:55,599 --> 02:02:57,599
at least for some period of time in

3549
02:02:57,599 --> 02:02:59,599
response to the esc maybe you can

3550
02:02:59,599 --> 02:03:01,360
clarify but i think it's in response to

3551
02:03:01,360 --> 02:03:04,400
the escalated um

3552
02:03:04,400 --> 02:03:07,840
holiday phrase it's related to omicron

3553
02:03:07,840 --> 02:03:10,480
and uh a few other universities are kind

3554
02:03:10,480 --> 02:03:11,679
of like

3555
02:03:11,679 --> 02:03:13,920
uh considering back and forth in my

3556
02:03:13,920 --> 02:03:15,199
perspective

3557
02:03:15,199 --> 02:03:18,239
as somebody who loves in-person lectures

3558
02:03:18,239 --> 02:03:19,280
who

3559
02:03:19,280 --> 02:03:20,480
um

3560
02:03:20,480 --> 02:03:23,040
sees the value of that

3561
02:03:23,040 --> 02:03:25,760
to students to young minds

3562
02:03:25,760 --> 02:03:28,480
also looking at the data

3563
02:03:28,480 --> 02:03:30,080
seems

3564
02:03:30,080 --> 02:03:30,760
the

3565
02:03:30,760 --> 02:03:32,159
[Music]

3566
02:03:32,159 --> 02:03:34,239
risk aversion

3567
02:03:34,239 --> 02:03:37,599
in university policies around this given

3568
02:03:37,599 --> 02:03:40,880
how healthy the student population is

3569
02:03:40,880 --> 02:03:44,320
seems not well calibrated let's put it

3570
02:03:44,320 --> 02:03:47,040
this way also pathological pathological

3571
02:03:47,040 --> 02:03:49,119
is one way to put it given that i

3572
02:03:49,119 --> 02:03:50,719
believe depending on the university but

3573
02:03:50,719 --> 02:03:51,599
i think

3574
02:03:51,599 --> 02:03:53,360
many universities require that the

3575
02:03:53,360 --> 02:03:55,360
student body is vaccinated

3576
02:03:55,360 --> 02:03:57,040
at this point

3577
02:03:57,040 --> 02:03:57,920
so

3578
02:03:57,920 --> 02:03:59,920
i think it's a big mistake by stanford

3579
02:03:59,920 --> 02:04:01,040
to do this

3580
02:04:01,040 --> 02:04:02,800
and um

3581
02:04:02,800 --> 02:04:04,400
i i'd like to say that because i just

3582
02:04:04,400 --> 02:04:07,280
hope mit doesn't

3583
02:04:07,280 --> 02:04:08,719
but what are your thoughts about

3584
02:04:08,719 --> 02:04:10,079
everything things

3585
02:04:10,079 --> 02:04:12,159
i completely agree with you i think um

3586
02:04:12,159 --> 02:04:13,199
we have

3587
02:04:13,199 --> 02:04:14,880
failed in our mission

3588
02:04:14,880 --> 02:04:16,880
to educate our students

3589
02:04:16,880 --> 02:04:19,760
by these this decision uh and i think i

3590
02:04:19,760 --> 02:04:21,199
frankly just more broadly i think we

3591
02:04:21,199 --> 02:04:23,040
failed generally over the course of the

3592
02:04:23,040 --> 02:04:25,040
last year and a half in living up to our

3593
02:04:25,040 --> 02:04:27,679
educational mission

3594
02:04:27,679 --> 02:04:29,040
the in-person

3595
02:04:29,040 --> 02:04:31,440
teaching is vital

3596
02:04:31,440 --> 02:04:33,760
for and now i can understand you have

3597
02:04:33,760 --> 02:04:35,520
you have older faculty

3598
02:04:35,520 --> 02:04:37,119
the principle of focus protection says

3599
02:04:37,119 --> 02:04:38,560
provide some alternative teaching

3600
02:04:38,560 --> 02:04:40,159
arrangements for them

3601
02:04:40,159 --> 02:04:42,480
that makes sense to me

3602
02:04:42,480 --> 02:04:44,320
from the kids point of view

3603
02:04:44,320 --> 02:04:46,320
they're more harmed by not getting the

3604
02:04:46,320 --> 02:04:48,320
education we promised them

3605
02:04:48,320 --> 02:04:51,360
than by than by covid

3606
02:04:51,360 --> 02:04:53,599
so applying this principle of this focus

3607
02:04:53,599 --> 02:04:54,960
protection

3608
02:04:54,960 --> 02:04:58,000
let young professors teach in person

3609
02:04:58,000 --> 02:04:59,360
this is before the vaccine after the

3610
02:04:59,360 --> 02:05:01,119
vaccine let everyone teach in person

3611
02:05:01,119 --> 02:05:02,400
yeah this this the part i don't

3612
02:05:02,400 --> 02:05:03,760
understand the discussion we're even

3613
02:05:03,760 --> 02:05:05,840
having

3614
02:05:05,840 --> 02:05:07,280
um

3615
02:05:07,280 --> 02:05:09,840
okay let's leave focus protection aside

3616
02:05:09,840 --> 02:05:12,159
here because that's a brilliant policy

3617
02:05:12,159 --> 02:05:14,159
for perhaps for the future when there's

3618
02:05:14,159 --> 02:05:15,679
no vaccine

3619
02:05:15,679 --> 02:05:17,800
now with the vaccine i'm i'm

3620
02:05:17,800 --> 02:05:20,400
misunderstanding something here because

3621
02:05:20,400 --> 02:05:22,639
we're now in a space

3622
02:05:22,639 --> 02:05:23,599
that's

3623
02:05:23,599 --> 02:05:26,560
psychological not it's no longer about

3624
02:05:26,560 --> 02:05:28,800
biology because

3625
02:05:28,800 --> 02:05:30,960
uh with the booster shots which i

3626
02:05:30,960 --> 02:05:33,360
believe mit is now requiring before

3627
02:05:33,360 --> 02:05:34,800
january

3628
02:05:34,800 --> 02:05:37,199
with the booster shots the data shows no

3629
02:05:37,199 --> 02:05:40,320
matter how old you are the risks are

3630
02:05:40,320 --> 02:05:41,760
very low

3631
02:05:41,760 --> 02:05:43,040
for um

3632
02:05:43,040 --> 02:05:44,719
ending up in a hospital

3633
02:05:44,719 --> 02:05:46,960
relative to all the other risks you face

3634
02:05:46,960 --> 02:05:49,360
when you're older

3635
02:05:49,360 --> 02:05:51,760
i don't i don't understand can you

3636
02:05:51,760 --> 02:05:54,639
explain the policy around

3637
02:05:54,639 --> 02:05:55,760
closing

3638
02:05:55,760 --> 02:05:58,719
a university but also just a

3639
02:05:58,719 --> 02:06:00,239
policy about

3640
02:06:00,239 --> 02:06:02,719
just being so

3641
02:06:02,719 --> 02:06:04,639
uh scared still

3642
02:06:04,639 --> 02:06:06,480
in the university setting i think the

3643
02:06:06,480 --> 02:06:08,159
universities the great university has

3644
02:06:08,159 --> 02:06:09,760
done great harm

3645
02:06:09,760 --> 02:06:12,480
by modeling this kind of behavior yes

3646
02:06:12,480 --> 02:06:15,119
that to me decided to keep interrupting

3647
02:06:15,119 --> 02:06:17,199
but to me the university should be the

3648
02:06:17,199 --> 02:06:20,639
beacon of great behavior not not the

3649
02:06:20,639 --> 02:06:22,079
beacon of like

3650
02:06:22,079 --> 02:06:24,719
scared conservative

3651
02:06:24,719 --> 02:06:26,400
let's not mess up

3652
02:06:26,400 --> 02:06:28,159
let's not make it pathological it's not

3653
02:06:28,159 --> 02:06:31,520
make anybody angry let's it should be a

3654
02:06:31,520 --> 02:06:34,560
place to play in the space of ideas yes

3655
02:06:34,560 --> 02:06:37,599
so i think um the central problem is

3656
02:06:37,599 --> 02:06:38,960
actually related to the central problem

3657
02:06:38,960 --> 02:06:41,280
of covet policy more generally

3658
02:06:41,280 --> 02:06:43,040
the goal seems to be

3659
02:06:43,040 --> 02:06:46,239
to stop the disease from spreading

3660
02:06:46,239 --> 02:06:48,960
rather than to reduce the harm from the

3661
02:06:48,960 --> 02:06:51,360
disease

3662
02:06:51,520 --> 02:06:53,360
if the if the goal is to stop disease

3663
02:06:53,360 --> 02:06:56,159
and spreading the sad fact is we have no

3664
02:06:56,159 --> 02:06:59,119
technology to stop to accomplish that

3665
02:06:59,119 --> 02:07:01,599
at this point yes because like uh it's

3666
02:07:01,599 --> 02:07:04,079
already deeply integrated into the human

3667
02:07:04,079 --> 02:07:06,079
civilization well i mean it's here

3668
02:07:06,079 --> 02:07:08,960
forever right there's a zero survey of

3669
02:07:08,960 --> 02:07:11,280
white-tailed deer in the u.s it turns

3670
02:07:11,280 --> 02:07:12,880
out 80 percent of white-tailed deer in

3671
02:07:12,880 --> 02:07:15,679
the u.s have coveted antibodies

3672
02:07:15,679 --> 02:07:17,840
dogs get it cats get it

3673
02:07:17,840 --> 02:07:19,520
there's almost certainly human human

3674
02:07:19,520 --> 02:07:22,320
animal transmission of it um

3675
02:07:22,320 --> 02:07:23,920
i mean presumably i mean i've heard bats

3676
02:07:23,920 --> 02:07:25,440
get it apparently

3677
02:07:25,440 --> 02:07:27,599
so so you you have uh you have a

3678
02:07:27,599 --> 02:07:29,440
situation where you have this disease

3679
02:07:29,440 --> 02:07:31,679
that's here to stay yeah and it and the

3680
02:07:31,679 --> 02:07:33,360
vaccines don't stop the spread of it the

3681
02:07:33,360 --> 02:07:35,040
lockdowns don't stop spread it we have

3682
02:07:35,040 --> 02:07:38,239
no technology to stop the spread of it

3683
02:07:38,239 --> 02:07:40,159
um and so we're burning the earth trying

3684
02:07:40,159 --> 02:07:42,960
to stop do something that's impossible

3685
02:07:42,960 --> 02:07:45,199
rather than

3686
02:07:45,199 --> 02:07:47,199
working on what's possible

3687
02:07:47,199 --> 02:07:50,480
uh and so like you know like letting

3688
02:07:50,480 --> 02:07:52,400
regular college happen that's a great

3689
02:07:52,400 --> 02:07:55,119
good universities are a wonderful

3690
02:07:55,119 --> 02:07:56,320
invention

3691
02:07:56,320 --> 02:07:58,639
and it's contributed so much to society

3692
02:07:58,639 --> 02:08:00,719
to decide to shut it down

3693
02:08:00,719 --> 02:08:02,639
the universities should be fighting

3694
02:08:02,639 --> 02:08:04,639
tooth and nail to not be shut down not

3695
02:08:04,639 --> 02:08:07,040
the other way around yeah

3696
02:08:07,040 --> 02:08:09,199
whatever the mechanisms that uh results

3697
02:08:09,199 --> 02:08:10,639
in the universities doing that that's

3698
02:08:10,639 --> 02:08:12,880
probably this is me talking it probably

3699
02:08:12,880 --> 02:08:14,480
has to do with certain incentives for

3700
02:08:14,480 --> 02:08:16,079
the administration probably has to do

3701
02:08:16,079 --> 02:08:17,840
with lawyers and legal kinds of things

3702
02:08:17,840 --> 02:08:18,719
to

3703
02:08:18,719 --> 02:08:23,040
to avoid uh legal trouble but once again

3704
02:08:23,040 --> 02:08:24,800
it's when the administration has too

3705
02:08:24,800 --> 02:08:27,360
much power and too much uh definition of

3706
02:08:27,360 --> 02:08:29,040
what the policy is for the university

3707
02:08:29,040 --> 02:08:30,880
that's when you get into trouble the

3708
02:08:30,880 --> 02:08:31,840
beauty

3709
02:08:31,840 --> 02:08:33,520
the power of the university should be

3710
02:08:33,520 --> 02:08:36,239
about the faculty and the students

3711
02:08:36,239 --> 02:08:38,480
administration

3712
02:08:38,480 --> 02:08:40,239
just gets in the way

3713
02:08:40,239 --> 02:08:42,000
get out of the way i mean they can help

3714
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:43,760
organize things they they play some

3715
02:08:43,760 --> 02:08:45,840
important role but they certainly do but

3716
02:08:45,840 --> 02:08:47,199
they need to remember what the mission

3717
02:08:47,199 --> 02:08:49,440
is the mission is not

3718
02:08:49,440 --> 02:08:52,079
safety the mission actually university

3719
02:08:52,079 --> 02:08:53,920
should be dangerous places you know for

3720
02:08:53,920 --> 02:08:56,880
ideas and and and whatnot

3721
02:08:56,880 --> 02:08:59,040
what is the role of fear in a pandemic

3722
02:08:59,040 --> 02:09:00,960
we've been dancing around it is it

3723
02:09:00,960 --> 02:09:03,760
useful is it destructive or is there

3724
02:09:03,760 --> 02:09:06,079
sort of a complicated story here because

3725
02:09:06,079 --> 02:09:07,920
uh instead of taking us back into

3726
02:09:07,920 --> 02:09:09,840
january 2020

3727
02:09:09,840 --> 02:09:11,760
there's so much uncertainty this could

3728
02:09:11,760 --> 02:09:14,239
have been a pandemic that

3729
02:09:14,239 --> 02:09:15,119
um

3730
02:09:15,119 --> 02:09:17,840
is black death the bubonic plague it

3731
02:09:17,840 --> 02:09:19,520
could have killed

3732
02:09:19,520 --> 02:09:21,280
hundreds of millions of people we don't

3733
02:09:21,280 --> 02:09:22,480
know that

3734
02:09:22,480 --> 02:09:24,400
we're we're very new to this it's been a

3735
02:09:24,400 --> 02:09:26,400
while we're rusty

3736
02:09:26,400 --> 02:09:28,800
so like there is there is some value to

3737
02:09:28,800 --> 02:09:30,960
fear so that you don't do the stupid

3738
02:09:30,960 --> 02:09:33,040
thing you don't just go on living i

3739
02:09:33,040 --> 02:09:34,400
guess where i come from i think it's

3740
02:09:34,400 --> 02:09:36,560
almost entirely counterproductive

3741
02:09:36,560 --> 02:09:39,199
i think fear should never be used as a

3742
02:09:39,199 --> 02:09:42,800
tactic to manipulate human behavior

3743
02:09:42,800 --> 02:09:44,880
by public health so the fear on the

3744
02:09:44,880 --> 02:09:47,040
individual level

3745
02:09:47,040 --> 02:09:49,280
that feeling of fear you should be very

3746
02:09:49,280 --> 02:09:51,360
hesitant about that feeling because it

3747
02:09:51,360 --> 02:09:53,199
could be easily manipulated by the

3748
02:09:53,199 --> 02:09:56,239
powerful exactly so i think um that fear

3749
02:09:56,239 --> 02:09:57,840
is natural

3750
02:09:57,840 --> 02:10:00,560
and it it uh it's not something that you

3751
02:10:00,560 --> 02:10:02,320
have to you have to nest you have to

3752
02:10:02,320 --> 02:10:04,560
stoke to get when the facts on the

3753
02:10:04,560 --> 02:10:06,400
ground suggest it

3754
02:10:06,400 --> 02:10:09,119
right uh in fact the tendency for humans

3755
02:10:09,119 --> 02:10:11,280
in the in the face of

3756
02:10:11,280 --> 02:10:13,679
threats from infects disease is to is to

3757
02:10:13,679 --> 02:10:16,239
exaggerate the fear in their own minds

3758
02:10:16,239 --> 02:10:18,480
of the being contaminated by the

3759
02:10:18,480 --> 02:10:20,480
environment and by others that's just

3760
02:10:20,480 --> 02:10:22,560
natural to humans

3761
02:10:22,560 --> 02:10:23,520
and

3762
02:10:23,520 --> 02:10:25,679
the role of public health is not

3763
02:10:25,679 --> 02:10:27,840
necessarily to eradicate the fear but

3764
02:10:27,840 --> 02:10:29,280
like obviously technological advances

3765
02:10:29,280 --> 02:10:31,040
can help eradicate the fear but like but

3766
02:10:31,040 --> 02:10:33,520
it's really to help manage that fear

3767
02:10:33,520 --> 02:10:34,560
and

3768
02:10:34,560 --> 02:10:38,639
and uh help people put the the sort of

3769
02:10:38,639 --> 02:10:40,239
incentives that come out of that to

3770
02:10:40,239 --> 02:10:41,920
useful things as opposed to harmful

3771
02:10:41,920 --> 02:10:44,239
things

3772
02:10:44,320 --> 02:10:46,480
what's happened in this pandemic is that

3773
02:10:46,480 --> 02:10:48,320
there's been a deliberate policy to

3774
02:10:48,320 --> 02:10:49,760
stoke the fear

3775
02:10:49,760 --> 02:10:51,599
to help make people think that the

3776
02:10:51,599 --> 02:10:54,079
disease is worse than it actually is

3777
02:10:54,079 --> 02:10:56,480
in survey after survey you see this

3778
02:10:56,480 --> 02:10:59,040
and that's been incredibly damaging so

3779
02:10:59,040 --> 02:11:00,480
young people

3780
02:11:00,480 --> 02:11:03,199
have readily given away their

3781
02:11:03,199 --> 02:11:04,639
willingness participating in regular

3782
02:11:04,639 --> 02:11:05,440
life

3783
02:11:05,440 --> 02:11:08,320
because a they fear covid more than they

3784
02:11:08,320 --> 02:11:09,679
ought

3785
02:11:09,679 --> 02:11:11,280
and b they feared that they're going to

3786
02:11:11,280 --> 02:11:13,520
harm the vulnerable

3787
02:11:13,520 --> 02:11:15,119
in their lives

3788
02:11:15,119 --> 02:11:16,719
you put those two together and you just

3789
02:11:16,719 --> 02:11:18,320
that you get this powerful demand for

3790
02:11:18,320 --> 02:11:19,760
lockdowns you see this all over the

3791
02:11:19,760 --> 02:11:21,040
world

3792
02:11:21,040 --> 02:11:22,880
broadly speaking you have a powerful

3793
02:11:22,880 --> 02:11:25,840
demand for rational policies irrational

3794
02:11:25,840 --> 02:11:27,360
policies because i would like to mention

3795
02:11:27,360 --> 02:11:29,040
the flip side of that

3796
02:11:29,040 --> 02:11:32,639
i've been saddened to see how much money

3797
02:11:32,639 --> 02:11:34,719
there is to be made

3798
02:11:34,719 --> 02:11:37,360
by the martyrs

3799
02:11:37,360 --> 02:11:38,560
the people

3800
02:11:38,560 --> 02:11:40,560
the conspiracy theorists

3801
02:11:40,560 --> 02:11:42,800
that tell you

3802
02:11:42,800 --> 02:11:46,400
you should be afraid of the government

3803
02:11:46,400 --> 02:11:49,119
you should be afraid of the man

3804
02:11:49,119 --> 02:11:51,679
it feels like fear is the problem i

3805
02:11:51,679 --> 02:11:53,280
think there's some guy that once said

3806
02:11:53,280 --> 02:11:54,880
something about we should be we should

3807
02:11:54,880 --> 02:11:57,520
fear fear itself

3808
02:11:57,520 --> 02:11:58,719
uh

3809
02:11:58,719 --> 02:12:00,000
he was a president or something i

3810
02:12:00,000 --> 02:12:01,679
vaguely remember that

3811
02:12:01,679 --> 02:12:04,560
so i i so i'm worried about both sides

3812
02:12:04,560 --> 02:12:06,880
here that well i just i think the

3813
02:12:06,880 --> 02:12:08,800
general principle is that should not be

3814
02:12:08,800 --> 02:12:11,040
a tool of public policy right

3815
02:12:11,040 --> 02:12:12,960
right the true the public policy should

3816
02:12:12,960 --> 02:12:14,639
attempt and public health policy in

3817
02:12:14,639 --> 02:12:15,840
particular should attempt to address

3818
02:12:15,840 --> 02:12:16,960
that fear

3819
02:12:16,960 --> 02:12:18,239
uh

3820
02:12:18,239 --> 02:12:20,400
it's not that you should

3821
02:12:20,400 --> 02:12:22,960
tell people lies of course not tell

3822
02:12:22,960 --> 02:12:26,400
people accurately what the risk is

3823
02:12:26,400 --> 02:12:28,880
give people tools that have evidence

3824
02:12:28,880 --> 02:12:31,760
that they can address their risk with

3825
02:12:31,760 --> 02:12:32,840
um

3826
02:12:32,840 --> 02:12:36,079
and level with people when we don't know

3827
02:12:36,079 --> 02:12:38,639
i think that is the right adult way for

3828
02:12:38,639 --> 02:12:40,320
to deal with this pandemic from public

3829
02:12:40,320 --> 02:12:42,560
health point of view and that's that is

3830
02:12:42,560 --> 02:12:45,280
not the policy we have followed instead

3831
02:12:45,280 --> 02:12:46,960
public health has intentionally stoked

3832
02:12:46,960 --> 02:12:48,880
the fear in order to gain compliance

3833
02:12:48,880 --> 02:12:50,400
with his edicts

3834
02:12:50,400 --> 02:12:53,920
and i think the consequence of that is

3835
02:12:53,920 --> 02:12:56,480
people distrust public health

3836
02:12:56,480 --> 02:12:57,840
what you're talking about the distrust

3837
02:12:57,840 --> 02:12:59,440
of government i think is a partly a

3838
02:12:59,440 --> 02:13:01,280
consequence of that that that movement

3839
02:13:01,280 --> 02:13:03,280
which is much smaller once upon a time

3840
02:13:03,280 --> 02:13:04,960
is much larger now

3841
02:13:04,960 --> 02:13:07,440
because of essentially people look at

3842
02:13:07,440 --> 02:13:09,119
what the what public health has done and

3843
02:13:09,119 --> 02:13:11,520
said i mean they've lied to me a whole

3844
02:13:11,520 --> 02:13:13,440
bunch of times a whole bunch of things

3845
02:13:13,440 --> 02:13:15,520
is the general sense and there are

3846
02:13:15,520 --> 02:13:17,119
consequences of that

3847
02:13:17,119 --> 02:13:18,480
we're going to have to work in public

3848
02:13:18,480 --> 02:13:20,719
health for a long time to try to regain

3849
02:13:20,719 --> 02:13:22,800
the trust of the public

3850
02:13:22,800 --> 02:13:24,800
throughout all of this you've been

3851
02:13:24,800 --> 02:13:27,679
inspiring to me to a lot of people

3852
02:13:27,679 --> 02:13:29,280
you've been

3853
02:13:29,280 --> 02:13:30,960
uh fearless

3854
02:13:30,960 --> 02:13:32,560
uh bold

3855
02:13:32,560 --> 02:13:34,560
in these kind of challenging the

3856
02:13:34,560 --> 02:13:36,000
policies

3857
02:13:36,000 --> 02:13:38,960
and not in in a martyr kind of way

3858
02:13:38,960 --> 02:13:40,800
because you're walking

3859
02:13:40,800 --> 02:13:42,880
the line gracefully and beautifully i

3860
02:13:42,880 --> 02:13:44,400
would say

3861
02:13:44,400 --> 02:13:46,000
and

3862
02:13:46,000 --> 02:13:47,920
looking at that

3863
02:13:47,920 --> 02:13:49,520
i think you're an inspiration to a lot

3864
02:13:49,520 --> 02:13:51,920
of young people so i have to ask what

3865
02:13:51,920 --> 02:13:53,840
advice would you give them

3866
02:13:53,840 --> 02:13:55,520
if they're thinking of going into

3867
02:13:55,520 --> 02:13:58,560
science if they're thinking of having an

3868
02:13:58,560 --> 02:14:00,000
impact in the world what advice would

3869
02:14:00,000 --> 02:14:01,679
you give them about

3870
02:14:01,679 --> 02:14:03,679
their career

3871
02:14:03,679 --> 02:14:06,079
and maybe about their life thinking

3872
02:14:06,079 --> 02:14:08,000
about somebody in high school maybe an

3873
02:14:08,000 --> 02:14:10,159
undergraduate college i'd say a few

3874
02:14:10,159 --> 02:14:12,239
things one is this is a wonderful

3875
02:14:12,239 --> 02:14:15,199
profession you have an opportunity to

3876
02:14:15,199 --> 02:14:17,599
improve the lives of so many and do it

3877
02:14:17,599 --> 02:14:19,119
by having fun

3878
02:14:19,119 --> 02:14:20,800
the kind of play we're talking about

3879
02:14:20,800 --> 02:14:23,040
it's an absolute privilege

3880
02:14:23,040 --> 02:14:25,520
to be able to work in this kind of area

3881
02:14:25,520 --> 02:14:26,400
um

3882
02:14:26,400 --> 02:14:28,480
uh and to young people looking to say

3883
02:14:28,480 --> 02:14:30,000
that that have

3884
02:14:30,000 --> 02:14:32,639
some gifts or desired for for this area

3885
02:14:32,639 --> 02:14:34,400
i say please you know

3886
02:14:34,400 --> 02:14:36,880
go for it like do serious science

3887
02:14:36,880 --> 02:14:39,119
broadly yeah i mean it could be it could

3888
02:14:39,119 --> 02:14:40,719
be i mean i'm not i don't have any gifts

3889
02:14:40,719 --> 02:14:42,000
in ai but like you know it could be your

3890
02:14:42,000 --> 02:14:44,400
buddy but you know or in health or or in

3891
02:14:44,400 --> 02:14:46,880
medicine or whatever whatever your gifts

3892
02:14:46,880 --> 02:14:49,040
lie develop them work hard and develop

3893
02:14:49,040 --> 02:14:50,560
them because it's worth it it's worth it

3894
02:14:50,560 --> 02:14:52,480
not just um

3895
02:14:52,480 --> 02:14:54,480
not just because you get some status but

3896
02:14:54,480 --> 02:14:56,800
because the the journey is fun

3897
02:14:56,800 --> 02:14:59,119
and the result is uh improvement to the

3898
02:14:59,119 --> 02:15:01,520
lives of so many so i think that that is

3899
02:15:01,520 --> 02:15:04,400
the encouragement i give i'd also say if

3900
02:15:04,400 --> 02:15:06,159
you're looking at this ugliness of this

3901
02:15:06,159 --> 02:15:09,119
debate that's happened over the pandemic

3902
02:15:09,119 --> 02:15:11,360
i i'd say to young people we need you to

3903
02:15:11,360 --> 02:15:13,920
come come in and help transform it many

3904
02:15:13,920 --> 02:15:14,960
of the people you see in this debate

3905
02:15:14,960 --> 02:15:16,960
that behave poorly

3906
02:15:16,960 --> 02:15:19,119
i actually forgive them i've done my

3907
02:15:19,119 --> 02:15:20,480
best to try

3908
02:15:20,480 --> 02:15:21,679
um

3909
02:15:21,679 --> 02:15:22,560
because

3910
02:15:22,560 --> 02:15:24,400
their act their many of them are acting

3911
02:15:24,400 --> 02:15:26,400
out of their own sense that they're that

3912
02:15:26,400 --> 02:15:28,320
they need to do good but they've but the

3913
02:15:28,320 --> 02:15:30,719
mistake they've made is is in in is in

3914
02:15:30,719 --> 02:15:32,560
this arrogance and this power but when

3915
02:15:32,560 --> 02:15:34,320
you come in remember that example as a

3916
02:15:34,320 --> 02:15:36,480
negative example and so that you when

3917
02:15:36,480 --> 02:15:38,239
you join the debate

3918
02:15:38,239 --> 02:15:40,320
you'll join it in a spirit of humility

3919
02:15:40,320 --> 02:15:42,320
in the spirit of trying to learn um

3920
02:15:42,320 --> 02:15:44,880
while keeping that that love of

3921
02:15:44,880 --> 02:15:46,639
that led you to enter the field in the

3922
02:15:46,639 --> 02:15:48,159
first place

3923
02:15:48,159 --> 02:15:49,679
and yeah

3924
02:15:49,679 --> 02:15:52,220
choose forgiveness versus like derision

3925
02:15:52,220 --> 02:15:53,280
[Music]

3926
02:15:53,280 --> 02:15:54,320
um

3927
02:15:54,320 --> 02:15:55,920
like the people that

3928
02:15:55,920 --> 02:15:58,239
you know have messed up like give them a

3929
02:15:58,239 --> 02:15:59,280
pass

3930
02:15:59,280 --> 02:16:00,880
because that's how

3931
02:16:00,880 --> 02:16:02,400
it feels like that's how improvement

3932
02:16:02,400 --> 02:16:04,320
starts funny i've been thinking this

3933
02:16:04,320 --> 02:16:05,520
it's like uh

3934
02:16:05,520 --> 02:16:07,440
i told you i'm christian right so like i

3935
02:16:07,440 --> 02:16:09,440
thought like god has given me many

3936
02:16:09,440 --> 02:16:11,440
opportunities to forgive people learn

3937
02:16:11,440 --> 02:16:12,719
learn to practice how to do that give

3938
02:16:12,719 --> 02:16:14,719
you a gift it's a very humbling thing i

3939
02:16:14,719 --> 02:16:15,440
guess

3940
02:16:15,440 --> 02:16:16,840
is there a

3941
02:16:16,840 --> 02:16:18,400
memory

3942
02:16:18,400 --> 02:16:20,560
from when you were young that was very

3943
02:16:20,560 --> 02:16:22,159
formative to you

3944
02:16:22,159 --> 02:16:23,920
so you just gave advice to some young

3945
02:16:23,920 --> 02:16:25,599
people is there something that stands

3946
02:16:25,599 --> 02:16:28,880
out to you that uh

3947
02:16:28,880 --> 02:16:31,199
a decision you made an event that

3948
02:16:31,199 --> 02:16:33,519
happened that made you the man you are

3949
02:16:33,519 --> 02:16:35,359
today

3950
02:16:35,359 --> 02:16:37,760
i actually grew up in a relatively poor

3951
02:16:37,760 --> 02:16:40,318
environment like i was born in india

3952
02:16:40,318 --> 02:16:42,638
and i moved when i was four

3953
02:16:42,638 --> 02:16:46,160
my dad had uh eight brothers and sisters

3954
02:16:46,160 --> 02:16:48,318
and my mom had four brothers and sisters

3955
02:16:48,318 --> 02:16:50,718
she uh grew up in the salomon in

3956
02:16:50,718 --> 02:16:52,240
calcutta

3957
02:16:52,240 --> 02:16:54,718
my dad his dad died when he was young

3958
02:16:54,718 --> 02:16:56,398
and he supported his family his kid his

3959
02:16:56,398 --> 02:16:57,679
brothers and sisters with university

3960
02:16:57,679 --> 02:16:59,040
scholarship money

3961
02:16:59,040 --> 02:17:01,599
came to the u.s and my dad worked

3962
02:17:01,599 --> 02:17:02,799
in a mcdonald's even though he's an

3963
02:17:02,799 --> 02:17:04,879
electrical engineer couldn't find a job

3964
02:17:04,879 --> 02:17:08,558
in 1971 and so he worked at mcdonald's

3965
02:17:08,558 --> 02:17:11,840
um we lived in a in a uh like this this

3966
02:17:11,840 --> 02:17:14,240
basically like this the housing port

3967
02:17:14,240 --> 02:17:16,879
like development uh in in in cambridge

3968
02:17:16,879 --> 02:17:18,240
this like this middle building of the

3969
02:17:18,240 --> 02:17:19,519
17th floor of this like housing

3970
02:17:19,519 --> 02:17:20,558
development

3971
02:17:20,558 --> 02:17:21,439
um

3972
02:17:21,439 --> 02:17:24,478
i mean i i think that was transformative

3973
02:17:24,478 --> 02:17:26,638
for me like i didn't realize so much at

3974
02:17:26,638 --> 02:17:30,160
the time how that experience of being

3975
02:17:30,160 --> 02:17:31,760
essentially like

3976
02:17:31,760 --> 02:17:33,599
poor lower middle class

3977
02:17:33,599 --> 02:17:36,160
what effect it had on my outlook

3978
02:17:36,160 --> 02:17:37,519
you mentioned to me offline that you

3979
02:17:37,519 --> 02:17:39,439
listened to a conversation that i had

3980
02:17:39,439 --> 02:17:41,439
with my dad what what impact did your

3981
02:17:41,439 --> 02:17:43,439
dad have in your life what uh what

3982
02:17:43,439 --> 02:17:45,519
memories do you have about him he was a

3983
02:17:45,519 --> 02:17:47,359
rocket scientist actually

3984
02:17:47,359 --> 02:17:48,638
he

3985
02:17:48,638 --> 02:17:50,959
helped design rocket guidance systems he

3986
02:17:50,959 --> 02:17:52,959
died when i was 20

3987
02:17:52,959 --> 02:17:55,200
and i still miss him to this day

3988
02:17:55,200 --> 02:17:56,638
and i think that

3989
02:17:56,638 --> 02:17:58,718
experience of seeing him

3990
02:17:58,718 --> 02:18:00,000
sacrifice

3991
02:18:00,000 --> 02:18:03,599
his hidden self for his family

3992
02:18:03,599 --> 02:18:06,000
a brilliant man but uh in many ways

3993
02:18:06,000 --> 02:18:08,000
frustrated with like the the his

3994
02:18:08,000 --> 02:18:09,280
opportunities in the world which

3995
02:18:09,280 --> 02:18:10,398
publicly would let him to come to the

3996
02:18:10,398 --> 02:18:12,718
u.s in the first place

3997
02:18:12,718 --> 02:18:13,840
that's

3998
02:18:13,840 --> 02:18:15,439
transformed that's had a transformative

3999
02:18:15,439 --> 02:18:17,439
effect on me and i wish i could tell him

4000
02:18:17,439 --> 02:18:18,398
that

4001
02:18:18,398 --> 02:18:21,039
looking back

4002
02:18:21,519 --> 02:18:23,200
do you

4003
02:18:23,200 --> 02:18:25,359
think about your own mortality do you

4004
02:18:25,359 --> 02:18:27,599
think about your death your dad is no

4005
02:18:27,599 --> 02:18:29,280
longer with us

4006
02:18:29,280 --> 02:18:30,799
you're the

4007
02:18:30,799 --> 02:18:33,359
the old wise sage

4008
02:18:33,359 --> 02:18:35,679
that represents it's funny

4009
02:18:35,679 --> 02:18:36,879
i've only

4010
02:18:36,879 --> 02:18:39,120
worried about death uh once in this

4011
02:18:39,120 --> 02:18:41,200
pandemic although i've had two of my

4012
02:18:41,200 --> 02:18:42,080
cousin

4013
02:18:42,080 --> 02:18:46,080
who was 73 and my my uncle was 74 die

4014
02:18:46,080 --> 02:18:48,160
in india during the pandemic and i

4015
02:18:48,160 --> 02:18:52,638
grieved them both from covid um

4016
02:18:52,638 --> 02:18:54,478
like the fear of covid really has only

4017
02:18:54,478 --> 02:18:55,439
hit me

4018
02:18:55,439 --> 02:18:57,280
only really literally once during this

4019
02:18:57,280 --> 02:18:59,200
it wasn't for me

4020
02:18:59,200 --> 02:19:01,280
and i recognized it's irrational so on

4021
02:19:01,280 --> 02:19:03,760
the eve of the santa clara county zero

4022
02:19:03,760 --> 02:19:05,200
prevalent study

4023
02:19:05,200 --> 02:19:07,599
um it was it was a really interesting

4024
02:19:07,599 --> 02:19:09,599
thing because so many people volunteered

4025
02:19:09,599 --> 02:19:11,120
to help

4026
02:19:11,120 --> 02:19:14,000
and um my my my daughter

4027
02:19:14,000 --> 02:19:16,318
who's 20 she was i guess was 19 at the

4028
02:19:16,318 --> 02:19:18,080
time and my wife also volunteered to

4029
02:19:18,080 --> 02:19:20,080
help with like various aspects of the

4030
02:19:20,080 --> 02:19:22,080
study and so the eve of the study they

4031
02:19:22,080 --> 02:19:24,000
were going to go out in public

4032
02:19:24,000 --> 02:19:25,359
and i didn't know what the death rate

4033
02:19:25,359 --> 02:19:27,679
was because we hadn't done the study

4034
02:19:27,679 --> 02:19:29,760
and i suspected it was lower than people

4035
02:19:29,760 --> 02:19:31,519
were saying but i didn't know

4036
02:19:31,519 --> 02:19:32,718
i knew

4037
02:19:32,718 --> 02:19:34,318
about the age gradient because i'd seen

4038
02:19:34,318 --> 02:19:35,679
the chinese data

4039
02:19:35,679 --> 02:19:37,679
and my my daughter is young but my wife

4040
02:19:37,679 --> 02:19:39,040
is my age

4041
02:19:39,040 --> 02:19:40,799
and i didn't know the death rate

4042
02:19:40,799 --> 02:19:43,439
and i couldn't sleep the night before

4043
02:19:43,439 --> 02:19:45,840
like what if i'm putting my family

4044
02:19:45,840 --> 02:19:48,558
my kid my daughter and my wife at risk

4045
02:19:48,558 --> 02:19:50,479
because of some some activity that i'm

4046
02:19:50,479 --> 02:19:51,600
doing

4047
02:19:51,600 --> 02:19:53,520
um it was kind of i don't know i mean it

4048
02:19:53,520 --> 02:19:56,880
was so worried about the well-being

4049
02:19:56,880 --> 02:19:59,600
and of others yeah when you look in the

4050
02:19:59,600 --> 02:20:01,840
mirror i if i die i die i mean like i

4051
02:20:01,840 --> 02:20:04,319
just it's not i again i'm christian so i

4052
02:20:04,319 --> 02:20:06,720
don't death is not the end for me uh i

4053
02:20:06,720 --> 02:20:08,720
believe um and so i don't i don't

4054
02:20:08,720 --> 02:20:10,399
particularly worried about my own death

4055
02:20:10,399 --> 02:20:12,960
but i i do

4056
02:20:12,960 --> 02:20:14,399
i mean i just i think we can't help but

4057
02:20:14,399 --> 02:20:15,920

loved ones

4059
02:20:17,520 --> 02:20:19,200
so

4060
02:20:19,200 --> 02:20:21,280
from the perspective of god then let me

4061
02:20:21,280 --> 02:20:23,200
ask you um

4062
02:20:23,200 --> 02:20:24,640
what do you think is the meaning of this

4063
02:20:24,640 --> 02:20:26,160
whole journey we're on what do you think

4064
02:20:26,160 --> 02:20:27,840
is the meaning of life

4065
02:20:27,840 --> 02:20:30,640
no it's very simple love one another

4066
02:20:30,640 --> 02:20:32,479
treat your neighbor as yourself

4067
02:20:32,479 --> 02:20:35,600
it's love yeah simple as that

4068
02:20:35,600 --> 02:20:37,600
well i'd love to see a little bit more

4069
02:20:37,600 --> 02:20:39,840
of that in this pandemic

4070
02:20:39,840 --> 02:20:42,720
it's an opportunity for the best

4071
02:20:42,720 --> 02:20:45,120
of our nature to shine it's so i've seen

4072
02:20:45,120 --> 02:20:47,040
some of the worst

4073
02:20:47,040 --> 02:20:49,040
um but i think some of that is just good

4074
02:20:49,040 --> 02:20:52,240
therapy and uh i'm hoping in the end

4075
02:20:52,240 --> 02:20:55,120
