the following is a conversation with jay,00:00:00.000,1.76
baracaria professor of medicine health,00:00:01.760,2.88
policy and economics at stanford,00:00:04.640,2.0
university,00:00:06.640,1.52
please allow me to say a few words about,00:00:08.160,2.24
lockdowns and the blinding destructive,00:00:10.400,2.64
effects of arrogance on leadership,00:00:13.040,2.479
especially in the space of policy and,00:00:15.519,2.561
politics,00:00:18.080,1.6
jay barakaria is the co-author of the,00:00:19.680,2.24
now famous great barrington declaration,00:00:21.920,2.4
a one-page document that in october 2020,00:00:24.320,3.44
made a case against the effectiveness of,00:00:27.760,2.4
lockdowns,00:00:30.160,1.76
most of this podcast conversation is,00:00:31.920,1.68
about the ideas related to this document,00:00:33.600,2.639
and so let me say a few things here,00:00:36.239,2.64
about what troubles me,00:00:38.879,2.561
those who advocate for lockdowns as a,00:00:41.440,2.08
policy,00:00:43.520,0.879
often ignore the quiet suffering of,00:00:44.399,1.921
millions that it results in which,00:00:46.320,2.239
includes economic pain loss of jobs that,00:00:48.559,2.721
give meaning and pride in the face of,00:00:51.280,1.759
uncertainty the increase in suicide and,00:00:53.039,2.721
suicidal ideation and in general the,00:00:55.760,2.88
fear and anger that arises from the,00:00:58.640,2.48
powerlessness forced onto the populace,00:01:01.120,2.88
but the self-proclaimed elites and,00:01:04.000,2.159
experts,00:01:06.159,1.841
many folks whose job is unaffected by,00:01:08.000,2.479
the lockdowns talk down to the masses,00:01:10.479,2.241
about which path forward is right and,00:01:12.720,2.16
which is wrong,00:01:14.880,1.52
what troubles me most,00:01:16.400,1.759
is this very lack of empathy among the,00:01:18.159,2.081
policymakers for the common man,00:01:20.240,2.559
and in general for people unlike,00:01:22.799,1.841
themselves the landscape of suffering is,00:01:24.640,2.88
vast and must be fully considered in,00:01:27.520,2.8
calculating the response to the pandemic,00:01:30.320,2.72
with humility and with rigorous,00:01:33.040,3.2
open-minded scientific debate,00:01:36.240,2.96
jay and i talk about the email from,00:01:39.200,1.919
francis collins to anthony fauci that,00:01:41.119,2.401
called jay and his two co-authors,00:01:43.520,2.879
fringe epidemiologists and also called,00:01:46.399,3.04
for a devastating published takedown of,00:01:49.439,2.081
their ideas,00:01:51.520,1.599
these words from francis,00:01:53.119,2.081
broke my heart,00:01:55.200,1.76
i understand them i can even steel man,00:01:56.960,2.56
them,00:01:59.520,1.04
but nevertheless on balance they show to,00:02:00.560,3.12
me a failure of leadership,00:02:03.680,2.88
leadership in a pandemic is hard,00:02:06.560,2.318
which is why great leaders are,00:02:08.878,1.682
remembered by history,00:02:10.560,2.0
they are rare they stand out,00:02:12.560,3.28
and they give me hope,00:02:15.840,2.56
also this whole mess,00:02:18.400,2.4
inspires me on my small individual level,00:02:20.800,2.0
to do the right thing,00:02:22.800,1.76
in the face of conformity,00:02:24.560,2.08
despite the long odds,00:02:26.640,2.72
i talked to francis collins i talked to,00:02:29.360,2.4
albert burleigh pfizer ceo,00:02:31.760,2.24
i also talked and will continue to talk,00:02:34.000,2.4
with people like jay,00:02:36.400,1.44
and other dissenting voices that,00:02:37.840,2.0
challenge the mainstream narratives and,00:02:39.840,2.24
those in the seats of power,00:02:42.080,2.56
i hope to highlight both the strengths,00:02:44.640,2.0
and weaknesses in their ideas with,00:02:46.640,2.56
respect and empathy but also with guts,00:02:49.200,2.96
and skill,00:02:52.160,1.68
the skill part i hope to improve on over,00:02:53.840,2.56
time,00:02:56.400,1.28
and i do believe that conversation,00:02:57.680,2.96
and an open mind is the way out of this,00:03:00.640,3.599
and finally as i've said in the past i,00:03:04.239,2.72
value love,00:03:06.959,1.36
and integrity far far above money fame,00:03:08.319,3.28
and power,00:03:11.599,1.201
those latter three are all ephemeral,00:03:12.800,3.04
they slip through the fingers of anyone,00:03:15.840,1.84
who tries to hold on,00:03:17.680,2.08
and leave behind an empty shell of a,00:03:19.760,2.559
human being,00:03:22.319,1.84
i prefer to die a man who lived by,00:03:24.159,2.321
principles that nobody could shake and a,00:03:26.480,2.399
man who added a bit of love to the world,00:03:28.879,3.761
this is the lex friedman podcast to,00:03:32.640,2.239
support it please check out our sponsors,00:03:34.879,2.321
in the description and now here's my,00:03:37.200,2.0
conversation with jay batakaria,00:03:39.200,4.56
to our best understanding today how,00:03:43.760,2.72
deadly is coveted,00:03:46.480,1.839
do we have a good measure,00:03:48.319,2.0
for for this very question,00:03:50.319,2.241
so the the best evidence for covet the,00:03:52.560,2.56
deadline to covet comes from a whole,00:03:55.120,2.24
series of zero prevalent studies sierra,00:03:57.360,2.799
preference studies are these studies of,00:04:00.159,2.16
antibody prevalence in the population at,00:04:02.319,1.84
large,00:04:04.159,1.44
i was,00:04:05.599,0.961
part of the you know the very first set,00:04:06.560,1.44
of sierra problem studies one in santa,00:04:08.000,1.36
clara county one in l.a county and one,00:04:09.360,1.68
in the with major league baseball around,00:04:11.040,1.68
the u.s uh if i may just pause you for a,00:04:12.720,2.719
second,00:04:15.439,1.601
if people don't know what uh serology is,00:04:17.040,2.08
in cerro prevalence it does sound like,00:04:19.120,2.238
you say zero prevalence it's not it's,00:04:21.358,2.162
cerro and serology's antibodies so it's,00:04:23.520,2.959
it's a a survey that counts the number,00:04:26.479,2.0
of antibodies specifically,00:04:28.479,2.561
people that have antibodies,00:04:31.040,2.4
specific to kovaid which perhaps shows,00:04:33.440,2.8
an indication that they likely have had,00:04:36.240,2.399
cobit and therefore this is a way to,00:04:38.639,2.161
study how many people in the population,00:04:40.800,2.24
have been exposed to have had,00:04:43.040,2.4
exactly yeah exactly so the idea is that,00:04:45.440,2.72
uh,00:04:48.160,2.16
we don't know,00:04:50.320,1.439
exactly the number of people with cove,00:04:51.759,1.681
just by counting the people that are,00:04:53.440,1.68
there to present themselves with,00:04:55.120,1.359
symptoms of covid um covet has it turns,00:04:56.479,2.241
out a very wide range of symptoms,00:04:58.720,1.919
possible ranging from no symptoms at all,00:05:00.639,3.441
to this deadly viral pneumonia that's,00:05:04.080,1.92
killed so many people and the problem is,00:05:06.000,2.24
like in if you just count the number of,00:05:08.240,1.679
cases the people who have very few,00:05:09.919,1.201
symptoms so often don't show up for,00:05:11.120,2.72
testing we just don't they're outside of,00:05:13.840,1.68
the can of of public health,00:05:15.520,2.48
and so it's really hard to know that the,00:05:18.000,2.8
answer to your question without,00:05:20.800,1.44
understanding how many people are,00:05:22.240,1.28
infected because you you can probably,00:05:23.520,1.76
tell the number of deaths that's even,00:05:25.280,1.199
though there's some controversy over,00:05:26.479,1.201
that but uh that so that the numerators,00:05:27.680,2.72
is possible but the denominator is much,00:05:30.400,1.84
harder how much controversy is there,00:05:32.240,2.08
about the death we're gonna go on,00:05:34.320,1.52
million tangents is that okay we're,00:05:35.840,2.72
gonna i have a million questions so one,00:05:38.560,2.88
i love data so much,00:05:41.440,2.0
but i've like almost tuned out paying,00:05:43.440,2.24
attention to cover data because i feel,00:05:45.680,2.079
like i'm walking on shaky ground i don't,00:05:47.759,2.481
know who to trust,00:05:50.240,1.36
um maybe you can comment on different,00:05:51.600,1.84
sources of data different kinds of data,00:05:53.440,2.56
the death one that seems like a really,00:05:56.000,1.919
important one,00:05:57.919,1.201
can we trust the reported deaths,00:05:59.120,2.88
associated with covid or is it just a,00:06:02.000,1.919
giant messy thing that mixed up and then,00:06:03.919,2.321
there's this kind of stories about,00:06:06.240,2.16
hospitals being incentivized,00:06:08.400,3.04
uh to report a death as covert death so,00:06:11.440,3.039
uh uh there's some truth in some of that,00:06:14.479,1.84
let me just so,00:06:16.319,1.44
let me just talk about the incentive so,00:06:17.759,1.681
in the united states,00:06:19.440,2.0
we passed this cares act that was aimed,00:06:21.440,2.879
at,00:06:24.319,0.72
making sure hospital assistance didn't,00:06:25.039,1.44
go bankrupt in the early days the,00:06:26.479,1.681
pandemic,00:06:28.160,1.2
the couple things they did one was they,00:06:29.360,2.0
provided incentives to treat covet,00:06:31.360,2.24
patients,00:06:33.600,0.96
tens of thousands of dollars extra per,00:06:34.560,2.32
per covered patient,00:06:36.880,1.759
um and the other thing they did is they,00:06:38.639,1.601
they gave a 20 bump to medicare payments,00:06:40.240,2.16
for elderly patients who are treated,00:06:42.400,1.44
with covet the idea is that there's more,00:06:43.840,1.6
expensive to treat them i guess the,00:06:45.440,1.28
early days um so that did provide an,00:06:46.720,2.319
incentive to sort of have have a lot of,00:06:49.039,2.0
code patients in the hospital because,00:06:51.039,2.0
your financial,00:06:53.039,1.6
success of the hospital or at least not,00:06:54.639,1.761
by the lack of financial ruin depended,00:06:56.400,1.84
on having many covered patients the,00:06:58.240,2.32
other thing on the death certificates is,00:07:00.560,1.68
that reporting of deaths is a separate,00:07:02.240,1.44
issue i don't know that there's a,00:07:03.680,1.04
financial incentive there but there is,00:07:04.720,2.08
this sort of like complicated you know,00:07:06.800,2.08
when you fill out a death certificate,00:07:08.880,2.24
for a patient with a lot of conditions,00:07:11.120,2.4
uh like let's say a patient has diabetes,00:07:13.520,1.76
a patient that well that diabetes could,00:07:15.280,2.0
lead to,00:07:17.280,1.84
heart failure you know you have a heart,00:07:19.120,1.359
attack heart failure your lungs fill up,00:07:20.479,2.641
then you get covered and,00:07:23.120,2.4
what and you die so what do you what do,00:07:25.520,1.44
you write on the death certificate was,00:07:26.960,1.2
it cause it covered the killed you was,00:07:28.160,1.439
it the lungs filling up was it the the,00:07:29.599,2.32
heart heart failure was it the diabetes,00:07:31.919,2.0
it's really difficult to like,00:07:33.919,1.68
disentangle,00:07:35.599,1.361
um and i think a lot of a lot of times,00:07:36.960,2.56
what's happened is they people have like,00:07:39.520,2.0
erred on the side of signing is covet,00:07:41.520,3.119
now what's the evidence of this there's,00:07:44.639,1.521
been a couple of,00:07:46.160,1.439
of audits of death certificates in,00:07:47.599,2.0
places like santa clara county where i,00:07:49.599,1.6
live in alameda county,00:07:51.199,1.921
uh california where they they carefully,00:07:53.120,2.4
went through the death certificate said,00:07:55.520,1.04
okay is this reasonable to say this was,00:07:56.560,1.6
actually covered or is it was covered,00:07:58.160,1.599
incidental and they found that about 25,00:07:59.759,2.641
20 25 of the deaths were,00:08:02.400,2.239
more likely incidental than directly due,00:08:04.639,2.321
to covet,00:08:06.960,1.28
i i personally don't get too excited,00:08:08.240,1.679
about this i mean it's a philosophical,00:08:09.919,1.68
question right like ultimately,00:08:11.599,2.32
what kills you,00:08:13.919,1.68
it's which is an odd thing to say if you,00:08:15.599,1.841
if you're if you're not you're not in,00:08:17.440,1.439
medicine but like really it's it's a,00:08:18.879,2.481
it's almost always multifactorial it's,00:08:21.360,1.92
always always just the bus hits you the,00:08:23.280,1.84
bus hits you that you get a brain bleed,00:08:25.120,1.919
was the brain bleed that killed you,00:08:27.039,1.44
would it burst anyway i mean you know,00:08:28.479,2.0
the bus hits you killed you right the,00:08:30.479,1.92
way you die is a philosophical question,00:08:32.399,1.601
but it's also a sociological and,00:08:34.000,1.679
psychological question because it seems,00:08:35.679,1.681
like,00:08:37.360,1.199
every single person who's passed away,00:08:38.559,2.801
over the past couple of years kind of,00:08:41.360,1.919
the first question that comes to mind is,00:08:43.279,1.68
just was it not not just because you're,00:08:44.959,2.401
trying to be political but just in your,00:08:47.360,1.52
mind no i think there's a psychological,00:08:48.880,2.16
reason for this right so um,00:08:51.040,2.16
you know we have we spent uh the better,00:08:53.200,1.92
part of a at least a half century in the,00:08:55.120,1.92
united states not worried too much,00:08:57.040,2.32
about infectious diseases and we the,00:08:59.360,2.32
notion was we'd essentially conquered,00:09:01.680,1.52
them it was something that happens in,00:09:03.200,1.6
faraway places to other people,00:09:04.800,2.88
and that's true for much of the,00:09:07.680,1.12
developed world life expectancies were,00:09:08.800,1.92
going up,00:09:10.720,0.96
for you know decades and decades,00:09:11.680,2.159
and for the first time in living memory,00:09:13.839,2.161
we have a disease that can kill us,00:09:16.000,2.16
i mean i think we're effectively evolved,00:09:18.160,2.08
to fear that like the the panic centers,00:09:20.240,2.48
of our brain the lizard part of our,00:09:22.720,1.36
brain takes over,00:09:24.080,1.759
and our central focus has been avoiding,00:09:25.839,2.321
this one risk,00:09:28.160,1.6
um and so it's not surprising that but,00:09:29.760,2.24
people when they're filling out death,00:09:32.000,1.279
certificates or thinking about what what,00:09:33.279,2.081
led to the death,00:09:35.360,1.12
this most salient thing that's in the,00:09:36.480,2.16
front of everyone's brain would jump to,00:09:38.640,1.84
the top,00:09:40.480,1.76
and we can't ignore,00:09:42.240,2.0
this very deep psychological thing when,00:09:44.240,2.719
we consider,00:09:46.959,2.161
what people say on the internet what,00:09:49.120,1.92
people say to each other what people,00:09:51.040,1.6
write in scientific papers what,00:09:52.640,1.92
everything it feels like,00:09:54.560,2.8
when covid,00:09:57.360,1.76
has been,00:09:59.120,1.44
um,00:10:00.560,1.76
has been brought onto this world,00:10:02.320,2.72
everything changed in the way people,00:10:05.040,2.799
feel about each other just the way they,00:10:07.839,2.161
communicate with each other i think,00:10:10.000,2.72
the the level of emotion involved,00:10:12.720,2.96
i think it in many people it brought out,00:10:15.680,2.399
the worst in them,00:10:18.079,2.401
for sometimes short periods of time and,00:10:20.480,1.68
sometimes it was always therapeutic like,00:10:22.160,2.0
you were waiting to get out like the,00:10:24.160,1.6
darkest parts of you,00:10:25.760,1.84
just to say if you're angry at something,00:10:27.600,1.919
in this world i'm going to say it now,00:10:29.519,2.081
and um i think that's probably talking,00:10:31.600,2.32
to some deep primal thing that,00:10:33.920,2.64
um,00:10:36.560,0.959
fear we have for um,00:10:37.519,2.56
formalities of all different kinds and,00:10:40.079,1.76
then when that fear is aroused and all,00:10:41.839,2.401
the deepest emotions it's like a,00:10:44.240,2.64
freudian,00:10:46.880,1.199
uh psychotherapy session but across the,00:10:48.079,2.481
world something that uh psychologists,00:10:50.560,2.32
are gonna have a field day with for,00:10:52.880,1.6
generation trying to understand um i,00:10:54.480,1.84
mean i think that,00:10:56.320,1.44
i mean what you say is right but piled,00:10:57.760,1.759
on top of that is also this sort of,00:10:59.519,4.32
uh this impetus to empathy to empathize,00:11:03.839,2.801
compassion toward others,00:11:06.640,1.92
essentially militarized,00:11:08.560,2.399
right so i'm protecting you by by some,00:11:10.959,4.32
actions,00:11:15.279,1.12
and,00:11:16.399,1.041
uh those actions if i if i don't do them,00:11:17.440,2.72
if you don't do them well that months,00:11:20.160,1.28
must mean you don't just you you hate me,00:11:21.440,2.48
um it's created this like social tension,00:11:23.920,2.32
that i've never seen before and we and,00:11:26.240,1.68
we start have started we started we,00:11:27.920,2.159
looked at each other as if we were just,00:11:30.079,1.76
simply,00:11:31.839,1.281
sources of of germs,00:11:33.120,2.48
rather than people to get to know,00:11:35.600,2.16
people to enjoy people to get you know,00:11:37.760,1.68
to learn from um it it colored,00:11:39.440,3.68
basically almost every human interaction,00:11:43.120,1.52
for every every human on the planet,00:11:44.640,2.48
yeah the basic common humanity it's like,00:11:47.120,2.719
you can wear a mask you can stand far,00:11:49.839,1.841
away,00:11:51.680,0.88
but the,00:11:52.560,0.959
love you have for each other when you,00:11:53.519,1.281
look into each other's eyes that was,00:11:54.800,1.92
dissipating and,00:11:56.720,1.679
by region too i've experienced having,00:11:58.399,2.641
traveled quite a bit throughout this,00:12:01.040,1.919
time,00:12:02.959,1.201
it um it was really sad even people that,00:12:04.160,2.64
are really close together just the way,00:12:06.800,1.92
they stood the way they looked at each,00:12:08.720,1.919
other,00:12:10.639,0.801
and i it made me feel for a moment,00:12:11.440,3.12
um,00:12:14.560,0.8
that the fabric that connects all of us,00:12:15.360,1.919
is more fragile than i thought,00:12:17.279,2.481
i mean if you walk down the street or if,00:12:19.760,1.519
you ever if you did this during covet,00:12:21.279,1.841
i'm sure you had this experience where,00:12:23.120,1.36
you walk down the street if you're not,00:12:24.480,1.12
wearing a mask or even if you are,00:12:25.600,2.0
people will jump off the off the,00:12:27.600,1.84
sidewalk as you walk past them,00:12:29.440,2.32
as if your poison,00:12:31.760,2.96
even though the data are that covet,00:12:34.720,2.08
spreads you know indifferently outdoors,00:12:36.800,2.08
or if at all really at outdoors,00:12:38.880,2.48
but it's not simply a biological or,00:12:41.360,2.64
infectious disease phenomenon or,00:12:44.000,1.44
immunological it's it is a it is a it's,00:12:45.440,1.92
a,00:12:47.360,0.64
it is a change in the way humans treated,00:12:48.000,2.24
each other i hope hope temporary,00:12:50.240,2.399
i do want to say on the flip side of,00:12:52.639,1.76
that so i was,00:12:54.399,1.521
mostly in boston massachusetts when the,00:12:55.920,2.4
pandemic broke out i think that's where,00:12:58.320,1.68
i was yeah,00:13:00.000,1.279
and then i got came here to austin texas,00:13:01.279,2.961
to visit my now good friend joe rogan,00:13:04.240,3.36
and he was the first person,00:13:07.600,2.32
without pause this wasn't a political,00:13:09.920,1.919
statement this was anything just walk,00:13:11.839,2.081
toward me and give me a big hug,00:13:13.920,2.479
and say it's great to see you and i,00:13:16.399,2.161
can't tell you how great it felt because,00:13:18.560,2.0
i in that moment realized the absence of,00:13:20.560,2.16
that connection back in boston over just,00:13:22.720,1.84
a couple of over a couple of months and,00:13:24.560,2.399
um,00:13:26.959,1.281
it's we'll talk about it more but it's,00:13:28.240,2.64
tragic to think about,00:13:30.880,2.0
that distancing that dissolution of,00:13:32.880,2.32
common humanity at scale what what kind,00:13:35.200,2.16
of impact it has on society just,00:13:37.360,2.8
across the board political division,00:13:40.160,2.479
uh and just in the quiet of your own,00:13:42.639,2.241
mind in the privacy of your own home the,00:13:44.880,1.92
depression the sadness the loneliness,00:13:46.800,2.24
that leads to suicide,00:13:49.040,2.0
and forget suicide just,00:13:51.040,2.799
low key suffering yeah no i think that's,00:13:53.839,3.041
that's the suffering that isolation,00:13:56.880,2.399
we're not meant to live alone we're not,00:13:59.279,1.841
meant to live apart from one another,00:14:01.120,1.279
that's of course the ideology of,00:14:02.399,1.44
lockdown is to make people live apart,00:14:03.839,2.721
alone isolated so that we don't spread,00:14:06.560,1.92
diseases to each other right,00:14:08.480,1.68
but we're not actually designed as a,00:14:10.160,1.6
species to live that way,00:14:11.760,2.24
and that uh what you're describing i,00:14:14.000,1.68
think,00:14:15.680,0.8
if everyone's honest with themselves,00:14:16.480,1.52
have felt uh especially in places where,00:14:18.000,2.24
that where lockdowns have been sort of,00:14:20.240,1.92
very militantly enforced has felt deep,00:14:22.160,2.64
into their core,00:14:24.800,1.44
well i if i could just return to the,00:14:26.240,1.68
question of deaths he said that the data,00:14:27.920,2.88
isn't perfect because we need these kind,00:14:30.800,2.32
of serial prevalence surveys to,00:14:33.120,2.399
understand how many cases there were to,00:14:35.519,2.401
determine the rate of deaths,00:14:37.920,1.919
and we need to have a strong footing in,00:14:39.839,2.24
the number of deaths but if we assume,00:14:42.079,1.521
that the the,00:14:43.600,1.28
the number of deaths is approximately,00:14:44.880,1.6
correct,00:14:46.480,0.96
like what's your sense what kind of,00:14:47.440,2.16
statements,00:14:49.600,1.359
can we say about the deadliness of covet,00:14:50.959,2.161
against,00:14:53.120,0.88
across different demographics maybe not,00:14:54.000,2.88
in a political way or in the current way,00:14:56.880,1.84
but when history looks back,00:14:58.720,2.4
at this moment of time,00:15:01.120,2.159
50 years from now 100 years from now the,00:15:03.279,1.92
way we look at the,00:15:05.199,1.841
pandemic 100 years ago,00:15:07.040,2.56
what will they say about the deadliness,00:15:09.600,1.76
of code i mean i think the deadlines of,00:15:11.360,2.4
kova depends on not just the virus,00:15:13.760,2.16
itself but who who it infects,00:15:15.920,2.24
um so the probably the most important,00:15:18.160,1.44
thing about it about the deadlines of,00:15:19.600,1.44
covet is is this steep age gradient in,00:15:21.040,3.359
the mortality rate um so according to,00:15:24.399,2.8
these zero prevalence studies that that,00:15:27.199,2.32
that have been done now hundreds of them,00:15:29.519,2.401
um,00:15:31.920,0.88
mostly from before vaccination because,00:15:32.800,1.599
vaccination also reduces the mortality,00:15:34.399,1.68
risk of covid um the the sierra,00:15:36.079,2.161
prevalent studies suggest that,00:15:38.240,2.719
the risk of of death if you're say over,00:15:40.959,2.161
the age of 70,00:15:43.120,1.6
is,00:15:44.720,1.2
very high if you have five percent,00:15:45.920,2.8
if you get covered,00:15:48.720,1.76
if you're if you're under the age of 70,00:15:50.480,1.68
it's lower,00:15:52.160,1.119
0.05 but there's not a single sharp cut,00:15:53.279,2.721
off it's more like i have a rule of,00:15:56.000,1.839
thumb that i use um so if you're 50,00:15:57.839,3.44
say the infection fatality rate from,00:16:01.279,2.161
covalent is 0.2,00:16:03.440,1.519
according to the zero prevalence data,00:16:04.959,2.401
that means 99.8 survival,00:16:07.360,2.8
if you're 50 and for every seven years,00:16:10.160,2.32
of age above that double it every seven,00:16:12.480,2.56
years of age below that have it,00:16:15.040,2.88
so 57 year old have a 0.4,00:16:17.920,2.88
mortality a 64 year old would have a,00:16:20.800,2.0
point eight percent and so on and uh if,00:16:22.800,2.32
you have a severe chronic disease like,00:16:25.120,1.76
diabetes or if you're more morbidly,00:16:26.880,1.84
obese it's like adding seven seven years,00:16:28.720,2.239
to your life,00:16:30.959,1.361
and this is uh for unvaccinated folks,00:16:32.320,2.639
this is unvaccinated uh in the before,00:16:34.959,2.641
delta also,00:16:37.600,1.359
are there a lot of people that will be,00:16:38.959,1.44
listening to this with phds at the end,00:16:40.399,2.481
of their name that would disagree with,00:16:42.880,2.16
the 99.8 would you say so i think,00:16:45.040,2.719
there's some disagreement over this uh,00:16:47.759,2.08
and the disagreement,00:16:49.839,1.601
is about the quality of the zero,00:16:51.440,1.839
prevalence studies that were conducted,00:16:53.279,2.8
so as i said earlier i was the senior,00:16:56.079,2.081
investigator in three different sierra,00:16:58.160,1.76
problem studies and very early in the,00:16:59.920,1.2
epidemic,00:17:01.120,1.76
i view them as very high quality studies,00:17:02.880,2.4
um we we um in santa clara county what,00:17:05.280,2.88
we did is we used a a test kit,00:17:08.160,3.039
uh to uh that we obtained,00:17:11.199,2.88
from uh someone who was works in major,00:17:14.079,2.401
league baseball actually he ordered,00:17:16.480,2.16
these test kits very early in march 2020,00:17:18.640,2.64
that measures very accurately measures,00:17:21.280,2.799
antibody levels,00:17:24.079,1.76
antibodies in the in in the bloodstream,00:17:25.839,2.401
uh these test kits were eventually were,00:17:28.240,1.76
approved by the the head of eua by the,00:17:30.000,2.88
emergency use authorization by the fda,00:17:32.880,2.96
sort of shortly after we did this,00:17:35.840,1.839
and uh it had a very low false positive,00:17:37.679,2.161
rate false plot of means if you if you,00:17:39.840,2.24
uh if you don't have these coveted,00:17:42.080,2.08
antibodies in your bloodstream the cut,00:17:44.160,2.16
kit shows up positive anyways that that,00:17:46.320,2.0
turns out to happen about point five,00:17:48.320,2.0
percent of the time,00:17:50.320,1.44
um and uh based on studies a very large,00:17:51.760,3.52
number of studies looking at,00:17:55.280,1.68
blood from 2018 you try it against this,00:17:56.960,2.32
kit,00:17:59.280,1.2
and uh you know point five percent of,00:18:00.480,1.76
the time 2018 there shouldn't be any,00:18:02.240,1.6
bodies there so for to cover if it turns,00:18:03.840,2.4
positive as a false positive 0.5 of the,00:18:06.240,2.0
time,00:18:08.240,1.36
um and then you know like a false,00:18:09.600,1.68
negative rate about 10,00:18:11.280,2.48
12 something like that i don't remember,00:18:13.760,1.84
the exact number but the false positive,00:18:15.600,2.079
rate is the important thing there right,00:18:17.679,1.12
so you have a population in march 2020,00:18:18.799,2.641
or april 2020 with very low,00:18:21.440,2.32
fraction of patients having been exposed,00:18:23.760,2.32
to code you don't know how much but low,00:18:26.080,2.64
even a small false positive rate could,00:18:28.720,1.839
end up,00:18:30.559,1.36
biasing your study quite a bit,00:18:31.919,2.321
but there's a formula to adjust for that,00:18:34.240,1.679
you can adjust for the fourth spot rate,00:18:35.919,1.441
falls negative rate we did we did that,00:18:37.360,1.6
adjustment and those studies found in a,00:18:38.960,3.28
community population so leaving aside,00:18:42.240,1.84
people in nursing homes who have a,00:18:44.080,1.28
higher death rate from covid um the that,00:18:45.360,3.12
the death rate was point two percent in,00:18:48.480,2.0
santa clara county,00:18:50.480,1.52
and in l.a county across all these,00:18:52.000,2.48
groups in the community community,00:18:54.480,2.0
meaning just like regular yeah so like,00:18:56.480,2.079
that that's actually a real important,00:18:58.559,1.041
question too so uh the santa clara study,00:18:59.600,2.48
we did this facebook sampling scheme,00:19:02.080,3.12
um which is i mean not not the ideal,00:19:05.200,2.479
thing but just like it was very,00:19:07.679,1.201
difficult to get a random sample on and,00:19:08.880,2.32
during the you know during lockdown,00:19:11.200,2.479
um where we put out uh an ad on facebook,00:19:13.679,3.281
soliciting people to,00:19:16.960,1.52
volunteer for the study a randomly,00:19:18.480,1.84
selected set of people we were hoping to,00:19:20.320,2.32
get a random selection of people from,00:19:22.640,1.44
santa clara county but it tended to the,00:19:24.080,2.24
people who tend to volunteer were from,00:19:26.320,1.44
the richer parts of the county like i,00:19:27.760,1.52
had,00:19:29.280,0.72
stanford professors writing begging to,00:19:30.000,1.52
be in the study because they wanted,00:19:31.520,1.36
antibody levels so we did some,00:19:32.880,2.32
adjustment for that in la county we,00:19:35.200,2.08
hired a firm that had a pre-existing,00:19:37.280,3.36
representative sample of la county,00:19:40.640,2.32
um,00:19:42.960,0.88
so but it didn't include nursing homes,00:19:43.840,2.0
it didn't include people in jail things,00:19:45.840,1.839
like that didn't include the homeless,00:19:47.679,1.12
populations so it's it's representative,00:19:48.799,2.24
of a community dwelling population,00:19:51.039,2.721
both of those and there we found that,00:19:53.760,3.12
both in l.a county and santa clara,00:19:56.880,1.6
county in april 2020 something like 40,00:19:58.480,3.04
to 50 times more infections than cases,00:20:01.520,3.6
in both places,00:20:05.120,1.52
so for every case that had been reported,00:20:06.640,2.399
to the public health authorities we,00:20:09.039,1.921
found that you know you know 40 or 50,00:20:10.960,3.28
other infections people with antibodies,00:20:14.240,2.4
in their blood,00:20:16.640,1.12
that suggested that they'd had coveted,00:20:17.760,1.76
recovered so people were not reporting,00:20:19.520,1.92
or severe at least in those days under,00:20:21.440,2.64
reporting yeah i mean there was you know,00:20:24.080,1.839
there's testing problems there weren't,00:20:25.919,1.441
so many tests available people didn't,00:20:27.360,2.4
know a lot of a lot of them we asked a,00:20:29.760,2.159
set of questions about the symptoms,00:20:31.919,1.361
they've faced,00:20:33.280,1.36
and most of them said they faced no,00:20:34.640,1.2
symptoms or the most uh 30 40 of them,00:20:35.840,2.16
said face their no symptoms,00:20:38.000,2.64
and i mean even these days how many,00:20:40.640,1.76
people report that they get covered when,00:20:42.400,1.84
they get covered okay i'll have those,00:20:44.240,2.08
numbers,00:20:46.320,1.12
that point two percent has that,00:20:47.440,2.32
approximately held up over time that is,00:20:49.760,1.84
so if professor john ian edis who's a,00:20:51.600,2.16
colleague of mine at stanford uh is a,00:20:53.760,1.84
world expert in meta analysis probably,00:20:55.600,1.36
the most cited scientist on earth i,00:20:56.960,2.0
think uh at least living,00:20:58.960,2.32
he he did a a meta-analysis of now a,00:21:01.280,2.24
hundred or more of these cereal,00:21:03.520,1.76
prevalence studies,00:21:05.280,2.08
um and uh uh what he found was that that,00:21:07.360,3.199
point two percent is roughly the,00:21:10.559,1.921
worldwide number in fact i think he,00:21:12.480,2.0
cites this lower number 0.15 percent,00:21:14.480,2.8
as the median infection fatality rate,00:21:17.280,2.08
worldwide,00:21:19.360,1.199
so we did these studies and it generated,00:21:20.559,2.24
an enormous amount of blowback,00:21:22.799,2.321
by people who thought that the infection,00:21:25.120,1.76
rate is much higher,00:21:26.880,1.44
and there's some controversy over the,00:21:28.320,1.599
quality of some of the other studies,00:21:29.919,1.521
that that are done and so there are some,00:21:31.440,1.84
people who look at this same literature,00:21:33.280,2.16
and say well the the lower quality,00:21:35.440,2.0
studies tend to have lower ifrs,00:21:37.440,2.16
the higher quality studies how far oh,00:21:39.600,1.76
infection fatality right i apologize i,00:21:41.360,2.0
do this in lectures too,00:21:43.360,2.319
and i'm going to rudely interrupt you,00:21:45.679,2.88
and ask for uh for the basics sometimes,00:21:48.559,2.48
if it's okay no of course so these these,00:21:51.039,2.241
higher quality studies they say are tend,00:21:53.280,2.24
to produce higher but the problem is,00:21:55.520,1.84
that if you want a global eye infection,00:21:57.360,2.72
fatality rate you need to get,00:22:00.080,2.56
sierra problem studies from everywhere,00:22:02.640,1.76
even places that don't necessarily have,00:22:04.400,1.6
the infrastructure set up to produce,00:22:06.000,1.44
very very high quality studies,00:22:07.440,2.08
and in poor places in the world,00:22:09.520,3.12
this the the st that uh like places like,00:22:12.640,2.56
africa the infection fatality rate is,00:22:15.200,1.76
incredibly low,00:22:16.960,2.64
uh and in some richer places,00:22:19.600,2.8
like new york city the infection,00:22:22.400,1.36
fatality rate is is much higher,00:22:23.760,2.88
it's there's a range of ifrs not a,00:22:26.640,2.399
single number,00:22:29.039,1.681
this sometimes surprises people because,00:22:30.720,2.0
they think well it's a it's a virus it,00:22:32.720,1.439
should have the same properties no,00:22:34.159,1.121
matter where it goes,00:22:35.280,1.36
but the virus,00:22:36.640,2.72
kills or infects or hurts in interaction,00:22:39.360,3.6
with the host,00:22:42.960,1.68
and the properties of both the host and,00:22:44.640,2.0
the virus,00:22:46.640,1.12
combine to produce the the outcome but,00:22:47.760,2.56
you also mentioned the environment too,00:22:50.320,2.56
well it's i'm thinking mainly just about,00:22:52.880,1.84
the the person like if i'm gonna think,00:22:54.720,1.6
about it like the most simplest way to,00:22:56.320,1.359
think about it is age age is the single,00:22:57.679,1.761
most important risk factor,00:22:59.440,1.76
so older places are going to have a,00:23:01.200,2.32
higher ifr,00:23:03.520,2.399
than younger places africa three percent,00:23:05.919,2.161
of africa is over 65. so in some sense,00:23:08.080,2.88
it's not surprising that they have a low,00:23:10.960,3.199
infection fatality rate so that's one,00:23:14.159,1.841
way you would explain the difference,00:23:16.000,1.2
between africa and new york city in,00:23:17.200,1.76
terms of the fatality rate is the age,00:23:18.960,2.16
the average age yeah and especially in,00:23:21.120,2.0
the early days of the epidemic in new,00:23:23.120,2.4
york city,00:23:25.520,1.279
the,00:23:26.799,0.88
uh,00:23:27.679,0.801
older populations living in nursing,00:23:28.480,2.24
homes were differentially infected,00:23:30.720,2.56
based on because of policies that were,00:23:33.280,1.68
adopted right to send,00:23:34.960,2.0
coveted infected patients back to,00:23:36.960,1.36
nursing homes to keep hospitals empty,00:23:38.320,1.839
what do you mean by differentially,00:23:40.159,1.52
infected,00:23:41.679,1.12
the policy that you adopt determines who,00:23:42.799,3.201
is most exposed right that okay so,00:23:46.000,2.48
that's what the policy it's the person,00:23:48.480,2.88
that matters,00:23:51.360,1.28
i mean it's not like the virus just kind,00:23:52.640,2.08
of it doesn't care i mean the policy,00:23:54.720,2.48
determines the nature of the interaction,00:23:57.200,2.0
and there's also i mean there is some,00:23:59.200,1.68
contribution from the,00:24:00.880,1.96
environment different regions have,00:24:02.840,2.12
different proximity maybe of people,00:24:04.960,2.56
interacting or the dynamics of the way,00:24:07.520,1.759
they interact,00:24:09.279,1.441
like if you have a if you have,00:24:10.720,1.36
situations where there's lots of,00:24:12.080,1.28
intergenerational,00:24:13.360,1.76
uh interactions yeah then you have a,00:24:15.120,2.64
very different risk profile than if than,00:24:17.760,2.24
if you have societies that are where,00:24:20.000,2.24
generations are more separate from one,00:24:22.240,1.439
another,00:24:23.679,0.961
um,00:24:24.640,1.039
okay so let me just finish real fast,00:24:25.679,1.521
about this so you you have in new york,00:24:27.200,3.04
you have a population that was infected,00:24:30.240,3.12
in the early days that was,00:24:33.360,1.6
very likely going to die but had a much,00:24:34.960,2.56
higher likelihood of dying if infected,00:24:37.520,2.48
and so new york city had a higher ifr,00:24:40.000,3.039
especially in the early days than um,00:24:43.039,2.321
than um then like africa has had,00:24:45.360,3.439
um the other thing is treatment right so,00:24:48.799,2.641
the treatments that we adopted in the,00:24:51.440,1.52
early days the epidemic i think actually,00:24:52.960,1.599
may have exacerbated the risk of death,00:24:54.559,3.841
which do so like,00:24:58.400,1.6
using ventilators like the the over,00:25:00.000,2.0
reliance on ventilators is what i'm,00:25:02.000,1.679
primarily thinking of but i can think of,00:25:03.679,1.281
other things,00:25:04.960,1.04
um but that that uh also we've learned,00:25:06.000,2.96
over time how better to manage patients,00:25:08.960,2.24
with the disease,00:25:11.200,1.44
so you have those you have all those,00:25:12.640,1.279
things combined so that's that's where,00:25:13.919,1.921
the controversy over this over this,00:25:15.840,1.52
number is i mean,00:25:17.360,1.76
new york city,00:25:19.120,1.76
also it has a is a central hub for those,00:25:20.880,3.279
who tweet,00:25:24.159,1.52
and uh those who write powerful stories,00:25:25.679,3.36
and narratives in article form,00:25:29.039,2.64
and i remember those quite dramatic,00:25:31.679,2.401
stories about sort of doctors in the,00:25:34.080,1.76
hospitals and these kinds of things i,00:25:35.840,1.52
mean there's very serious very dramatic,00:25:37.360,3.12
very tragic deaths going on always in,00:25:40.480,3.28
hospitals those stories,00:25:43.760,2.96
um,00:25:46.720,1.04
a lot of loved ones losing each other on,00:25:47.760,2.399
a deathbed that's always tragic and you,00:25:50.159,2.241
can always write a hell of a good story,00:25:52.400,2.159
about that and you should about the loss,00:25:54.559,2.48
of loved ones but they were doing it,00:25:57.039,2.321
pretty pretty well i would say um over,00:25:59.360,2.64
this kind of dramatic deaths and so in,00:26:02.000,2.72
response to that it's very,00:26:04.720,2.8
unpleasant to hear even to consider the,00:26:07.520,2.639
possibility that,00:26:10.159,1.76
the death rate is not as high as you,00:26:11.919,3.041
might otherwise as you might feel yeah i,00:26:14.960,3.199
was surprised by the reaction,00:26:18.159,2.321
both by regular people and also the,00:26:20.480,2.24
scientific community in response to,00:26:22.720,2.0
those studies those early studies in,00:26:24.720,1.76
april of 2020 um uh to me they uh they,00:26:26.480,3.6
were there were studies i mean they're,00:26:30.080,2.0
they're the kinds of not exactly the,00:26:32.080,2.079
kinds of work i've worked on all my life,00:26:34.159,1.281
but it's kind of kind of like the kind,00:26:35.440,1.76
of you know like you you write a paper,00:26:37.200,2.4
and you get response responses from your,00:26:39.600,2.319
fellow scientists and you you know,00:26:41.919,1.681
change the paper to improve it uh you,00:26:43.600,1.439
have hopefully learned something from it,00:26:45.039,2.081
well but to push back it's just a study,00:26:47.120,3.2
but there's some studies and this is,00:26:50.320,1.76
kind of interesting because i've,00:26:52.080,2.079
received similar pushback on other,00:26:54.159,2.241
topics,00:26:56.400,2.48
there's,00:26:59.360,1.04
some studies that,00:27:00.400,2.08
if,00:27:02.480,1.04
wrong might have a wide ranging uh,00:27:03.520,4.24
detrimental effects on society so that's,00:27:07.760,2.24
that that's the way they would perceive,00:27:10.000,1.36
the studies if you say the death rate is,00:27:11.360,1.76
lower and you end up as you often do in,00:27:13.120,2.88
science realizing that nope that that,00:27:16.000,2.08
was there was a flaw in the way the,00:27:18.080,2.0
study was conducted or were just not,00:27:20.080,1.92
representative of a broader population,00:27:22.000,1.919
and then you realize the death rate is,00:27:23.919,1.441
much higher that might be very damaging,00:27:25.360,2.24
in in people's view uh so so that's,00:27:27.600,2.88
probably,00:27:30.480,1.199
where the scientific community sort of,00:27:31.679,2.161
just steal man the kind of response is,00:27:33.840,3.439
that's where they felt like you know,00:27:37.279,2.64
there's some findings where you better,00:27:39.919,2.0
be damn sure before you kind of report,00:27:41.919,2.961
them,00:27:44.880,0.799
yeah i mean we were pretty sure we were,00:27:45.679,1.36
right and it turns out we were right so,00:27:47.039,1.441
like when we so um,00:27:48.480,2.319
we released the the santa clara study,00:27:50.799,3.36
via this open open science process and,00:27:54.159,2.64
this uh server called med med archive,00:27:56.799,2.321
it's it's designed for releasing studies,00:27:59.120,2.96
have not yet been pre-reviewed in order,00:28:02.080,2.0
to garner comment from the from,00:28:04.080,1.839
scientists before peer review,00:28:05.919,2.561
the the la county study we went through,00:28:08.480,1.679
the traditional peer review process,00:28:10.159,2.081
and got it published in the journal of,00:28:12.240,1.36
american medical association sometime in,00:28:13.600,1.52
like uh july i think forget the date of,00:28:15.120,2.559
2020.,00:28:17.679,1.281
the santa clara study released in april,00:28:18.960,1.92
of 2020 in this you know sort of working,00:28:20.880,2.32
paper archive,00:28:23.200,1.839
the the reason was that we felt we had,00:28:25.039,1.921
an obligation we had a result that was,00:28:26.960,2.959
we thought was quite important,00:28:29.919,1.841
and we wanted to tell the scientific,00:28:31.760,2.32
community about it and also tell the,00:28:34.080,1.44
world about it,00:28:35.520,1.12
and it wasn't we wanted to get feedback,00:28:36.640,1.36
i mean that's part of the purpose of,00:28:38.000,1.84
sending it to these kinds of places,00:28:39.840,2.319
i think a lot of the problem is that,00:28:42.159,2.88
uh when people think about published,00:28:45.039,1.921
science they think of it as,00:28:46.960,1.68
automatically true and if it goes,00:28:48.640,2.159
through peer review it's automatically,00:28:50.799,1.201
true if it hasn't gone through peer,00:28:52.000,0.96
review it's not automatically true and,00:28:52.960,2.079
especially in medicine when we're not,00:28:55.039,2.401
used to having this at this access to,00:28:57.440,3.04
pre-peer-reviewed,00:29:00.480,2.319
work i mean in economics actually that's,00:29:02.799,1.841
quite normal you it takes years to get,00:29:04.640,2.56
something published so there's a very,00:29:07.200,1.76
active debate over or discussion about,00:29:08.960,2.959
papers before they're peer-reviewed in,00:29:11.919,1.601
this in this sort of working paper way,00:29:13.520,2.32
um much less normal or much much newer,00:29:15.840,2.719
in in medicine,00:29:18.559,1.681
and so i think part of that the,00:29:20.240,1.36
perception about what those that what,00:29:21.600,2.4
process happens in open science when you,00:29:24.000,2.48
release a study,00:29:26.480,1.36
that that got people confused and you're,00:29:27.840,1.68
right it was a very important result,00:29:29.520,1.84
because we had just locked the world,00:29:31.360,1.84
down in middle of march,00:29:33.200,2.8
with i think catastrophic results,00:29:36.000,2.559
and if the if that study was right if,00:29:38.559,1.921
our study was right that meant we'd made,00:29:40.480,2.0
a mistake,00:29:42.480,1.36
and not because the death rate was low,00:29:43.840,1.839
that's actually not the key thing there,00:29:45.679,2.0
the key thing is that we had adopted,00:29:47.679,2.48
these policies these test and trace,00:29:50.159,2.4
policies these policies these lockdown,00:29:52.559,2.24
policies aimed at suppressing the virus,00:29:54.799,3.281
level to close to zero that was,00:29:58.080,2.16
essentially the idea,00:30:00.240,1.52
if we can just get the virus to go away,00:30:01.760,2.799
we won't have to ever worry about it,00:30:04.559,1.201
again,00:30:05.760,1.519
the main problem with our result as far,00:30:07.279,2.241
as that strategy was concerned wasn't,00:30:09.520,1.36
the death rate it was the 40 to 50 times,00:30:10.880,2.32
more infections than cases it was the,00:30:13.200,1.839
two and a half percent or uh three,00:30:15.039,2.0
percent or four percent prevalence rate,00:30:17.039,2.321
that we identified,00:30:19.360,1.76
of the antibodies in the population if,00:30:21.120,1.919
that number is right it's too late the,00:30:23.039,2.721
virus is not going to go to zero,00:30:25.760,2.159
and no matter how much we test and trace,00:30:27.919,1.76
and isolate we're not going to get the,00:30:29.679,1.521
viral level down to zero,00:30:31.200,2.64
so we're going to have to,00:30:33.840,1.68
let the virus go through the entire,00:30:35.520,1.68
population in some way or something,00:30:37.200,1.839
normal well that we can talk about that,00:30:39.039,1.441
in a bit that's the great barrington,00:30:40.480,1.36
declaration you don't have to let the,00:30:41.840,1.199
virus go through the population you can,00:30:43.039,1.441
shield preferentially,00:30:44.480,2.48
the policy we chose was to shield,00:30:46.960,2.079
preferentially the the laptop class,00:30:49.039,2.961
the set of people who could work from,00:30:52.000,1.52
home,00:30:53.520,0.879
without losing their job,00:30:54.399,1.921
yeah and we did a very good job at,00:30:56.320,1.92
protecting them well let me um,00:30:58.240,3.84
take a small tangent we're gonna jump,00:31:02.080,2.479
around in time,00:31:04.559,1.921
which i think will be the best way to,00:31:06.480,1.52
tell the story so that was the beginning,00:31:08.000,2.48
yeah okay actually can i kind of go back,00:31:10.480,2.319
one more thing for that because that's,00:31:12.799,1.281
really important and i should have i,00:31:14.080,1.12
should have started with this,00:31:15.200,1.52
um what led me to do those studies,00:31:16.720,3.6
was a a paper that i had remembered,00:31:20.320,2.4
seeing from the h1n1 flu epidemic in,00:31:22.720,2.88
2009 this is this is where i've been,00:31:25.600,1.84
much less active in writing about that i,00:31:27.440,1.68
had written up like a paper or two about,00:31:29.120,1.76
that when in 2009,00:31:30.880,3.36
there there was actually this same,00:31:34.240,2.159
debate over the mortality rate,00:31:36.399,2.321
except it unfolded over the course of,00:31:38.720,1.839
three years two or three years,00:31:40.559,2.561
the early studies,00:31:43.120,1.679
of the mortality rate,00:31:44.799,1.681
in h1n1 counted the number of cases,00:31:46.480,4.559
in the denominator count the number of,00:31:51.039,1.681
deaths in the numerator cases meaning,00:31:52.720,1.439
people identified as having h1n1 showing,00:31:54.159,2.721
up the doctor,00:31:56.880,1.279
you know tested to have it um and the,00:31:58.159,3.12
early estimates of the h1n1 mortality,00:32:01.279,2.64
were like four percent three percent,00:32:03.919,2.88
really really high,00:32:06.799,2.0
over the course of a couple of more,00:32:08.799,1.681
years a whole bunch of zero prevalence,00:32:10.480,2.0
studies zero prevalence studies of h1n1,00:32:12.480,1.84
flu came out,00:32:14.320,1.359
and it turned out that there were,00:32:15.679,2.561
a hundred or more times of people,00:32:18.240,2.64
infected per case,00:32:20.880,2.24
and so the mortality rate was actually,00:32:23.120,1.6
something like 0.02,00:32:24.720,2.64
for h1n1 not the three three,00:32:27.360,2.96
like a hundredfold difference so this,00:32:30.320,2.0
made you think,00:32:32.320,1.359
okay it took us a couple of two to three,00:32:33.679,2.081
years to discover the truth behind the,00:32:35.760,2.0
actual infections,00:32:37.760,2.159
uh for a h1n1 and then,00:32:39.919,2.88
what's the truth here and can we get,00:32:42.799,1.521
there faster yeah and and there was it,00:32:44.320,2.0
spreads in a similar way as the as the,00:32:46.320,1.76
h1n1 fluid did i mean it's it's spreads,00:32:48.080,1.76
very solidization via you know so,00:32:49.840,2.559
person-to-person breathing kind of kind,00:32:52.399,1.52
of contact up um and maybe maybe some by,00:32:53.919,2.561
by foam eyes but it seems like that's,00:32:56.480,1.439
less likely now in any case it seemed,00:32:57.919,2.64
really important to me to speed up the,00:33:00.559,2.401
process of having those zero prevalence,00:33:02.960,1.76
studies,00:33:04.720,1.04
so that we can better understand who was,00:33:05.760,2.08
at risk,00:33:07.840,1.12
and what the right strategy ought to be,00:33:08.960,3.12
this might be a good place to kind of,00:33:12.080,2.959
compare influenza,00:33:15.039,2.161
the flu and covid in the context of the,00:33:17.200,3.199
discussion we just had which is,00:33:20.399,2.241
how deadly is coved so you mentioned,00:33:22.640,2.399
covet is a very particular kind of,00:33:25.039,1.841
steepness,00:33:26.880,2.32
where the x-axis is age,00:33:29.200,2.88
so,00:33:32.080,1.36
in that context could you maybe compare,00:33:33.440,1.92
influenza and kovid because a lot of,00:33:35.360,2.4
people,00:33:37.760,2.08
outside the folks who suggest that the,00:33:40.399,2.561
the lizards who run the world have,00:33:42.960,2.319
completely fabricated invented kovid,00:33:45.279,3.041
outside of those folks kind of the,00:33:48.320,2.0
natural,00:33:50.320,1.04
process by which you dismiss the threat,00:33:51.360,1.84
of covait to say well it's just like the,00:33:53.200,2.24
flu the flu is a very serious thing,00:33:55.440,1.68
actually um so,00:33:57.120,2.32
in that comparison,00:33:59.440,2.239
where does kovitz stand,00:34:01.679,1.921
yeah the flu is a very serious thing it,00:34:03.600,1.36
kills you know 50 60 000 people a year,00:34:04.960,2.8
something i found that order depending,00:34:07.760,1.28
on the the particular strain that goes,00:34:09.040,1.679
around uh that's in the united states,00:34:10.719,1.92
the primary difference to me are the,00:34:12.639,2.24
there's lots of differences but one of,00:34:14.879,1.2
the most salient differences is the age,00:34:16.079,2.08
gradient and mortality risk for the flu,00:34:18.159,3.2
so the flu is more deadly for two,00:34:21.359,2.72
children than covet is,00:34:24.079,2.481
there's no controversy about that,00:34:26.560,2.799
children thank god,00:34:29.359,2.32
have much less,00:34:31.679,1.841
uh severe,00:34:33.520,1.44
reactions to covet infection to than,00:34:34.960,3.04
that due to flu infections and rate of,00:34:38.000,2.96
fatalities fatality all of that i think,00:34:40.960,2.0
you mentioned um,00:34:42.960,1.679
i mean it's interesting to maybe also,00:34:44.639,1.361
comment on i think in another,00:34:46.000,1.839
conversation mentioned there's a u,00:34:47.839,2.079
shape,00:34:49.918,1.122
to the,00:34:51.040,1.839
to the flu curve,00:34:52.879,1.441
so meaning like there's actually quite a,00:34:54.320,2.0
large number of kids that die from flu,00:34:56.320,2.799
yeah i mean the 1918 flu the h1n1 flew,00:34:59.119,3.201
that the spanish flu in the us killed,00:35:02.320,2.64
millions of of of uh of younger people,00:35:04.960,4.399
and um that is not the case with covid,00:35:09.359,4.081
more than um,00:35:13.440,1.6
i'm going to get the number wrong but,00:35:15.040,1.76
something like 70 80 percent of the,00:35:16.800,2.0
deaths are people over the age of 60.,00:35:18.800,2.799
well we've talked about the fear the,00:35:21.599,1.441
whole time really,00:35:23.040,1.84
but my interaction with folks,00:35:24.880,2.88
now i want to have a family i want to,00:35:27.760,1.44
have kids but i don't have that real,00:35:29.200,2.639
firsthand experience but my interaction,00:35:31.839,1.52
with folks is at the core of fear,00:35:33.359,2.321
that folks had,00:35:35.680,2.159
is for their children,00:35:37.839,2.0
like,00:35:39.839,1.681
that,00:35:41.520,1.36
somehow you know i don't want to get,00:35:42.880,2.16
infected because of the kids like,00:35:45.040,2.72
because god forbid something happens to,00:35:47.760,2.0
the kids and i think,00:35:49.760,2.0
that obviously that makes a lot of sense,00:35:51.760,2.64
this kind of,00:35:54.400,1.04
the kids come first no matter what,00:35:55.440,1.84
that's number one priority but in for,00:35:57.280,2.48
this particular virus,00:35:59.760,2.24
that reasoning was um,00:36:02.000,2.16
not grounded in data it seems like or,00:36:04.160,1.76
that emotion and feeling yeah it was not,00:36:05.920,2.159
grounded it wasn't at the same time this,00:36:08.079,2.481
is way more deadly than the flu just,00:36:10.560,1.84
overall and especially to older people,00:36:12.400,2.959
yes,00:36:15.359,1.041
right so the numbers when when the story,00:36:16.400,2.32
is,00:36:18.720,0.72
all said and done,00:36:19.440,1.52
the covet would take,00:36:20.960,1.92
many more lives yeah,00:36:22.880,2.08
so i mean 0.2 is sounds like a small,00:36:24.960,2.0
number but it's not a small number,00:36:26.960,1.52
worldwide what do you think that number,00:36:28.480,1.92
will be,00:36:30.400,0.959
by the you know that's not that's not,00:36:31.359,1.921
like but would we cross i think it's in,00:36:33.280,2.88
the united states it's uh,00:36:36.160,2.959
the way the desk currently reports like,00:36:39.119,1.681
800 000 something like that do you think,00:36:40.800,2.16
we'll cross a million seems likely,00:36:42.960,3.2
yeah do you think it's something that,00:36:46.160,2.08
might continue with different variants,00:36:48.240,2.0
what well i i think um so we can talk,00:36:50.240,2.0
about the end state of cover the end,00:36:52.240,1.28
state of covet is it's here forever,00:36:53.520,2.64
i think that there is good evidence of,00:36:56.160,4.08
immunity after infection,00:37:00.240,4.08
such that you're protected both against,00:37:04.320,1.92
reinfection and also against severe,00:37:06.240,2.56
disease upon reinfection,00:37:08.800,2.4
so the second time you get it it's not,00:37:11.200,1.76
true for everyone but for many people,00:37:12.960,1.6
the second time you get it will be,00:37:14.560,1.279
milder much milder than the first time,00:37:15.839,2.081
you get it with the long tail like uh,00:37:17.920,3.28
that lasts for a long time yeah so just,00:37:21.200,2.32
there's studies that uh that follow of,00:37:23.520,2.079
course people who are infected for a,00:37:25.599,1.601
year,00:37:27.200,0.96
and the reinfection rate is something,00:37:28.160,1.52
like somewhere between point three and,00:37:29.680,1.919
one percent yeah um and like a pretty,00:37:31.599,3.441
fantastic study italy's found that,00:37:35.040,1.68
there's there was one in sweden i think,00:37:36.720,1.92
there's a few studies that found there's,00:37:38.640,1.36
some similar things um and the,00:37:40.000,3.04
reinfections,00:37:43.040,1.84
tend to produce much mild disease much,00:37:44.880,2.16
less likely end up in the hospital much,00:37:47.040,1.44
less likely to die um so what the end,00:37:48.480,3.04
state of covid is it's circulating the,00:37:51.520,2.079
population forever and you get it,00:37:53.599,1.361
multiple times,00:37:54.960,1.44
yeah,00:37:56.400,1.199
and and then there's,00:37:57.599,1.441
i think studies and discussions like the,00:37:59.040,2.72
the best protection would be to get it,00:38:01.760,2.4
and then also to get vaccinated and then,00:38:04.160,2.32
a lot of people push back against that,00:38:06.480,2.16
for the obvious reasons from both sides,00:38:08.640,2.0
because somehow this the discourse has,00:38:10.640,2.0
become less scientific and more,00:38:12.640,1.28
political well i think you wanna like,00:38:13.920,2.56
the first time you meet it is going to,00:38:16.480,2.0
be the most deadly for you,00:38:18.480,1.68
and so the first time you meet it is,00:38:20.160,1.52
wise to be vaccinated the vaccine,00:38:21.680,1.52
reduces severe disease,00:38:23.200,2.08
yeah well we'll talk about the vaccine,00:38:25.280,2.24
because i want to make sure i address it,00:38:27.520,1.52
carefully,00:38:29.040,1.039
and properly in full context,00:38:30.079,3.52
um,00:38:33.599,1.281
but yes sort of uh to add to the context,00:38:34.880,3.04
a lot of the fascinating discussions,00:38:37.920,1.76
we're having is um in the early days of,00:38:39.680,2.48
covid and now for people who are,00:38:42.160,2.88
unvaccinated that's where the,00:38:45.040,1.76
interesting story is,00:38:46.800,2.16
the policy story the sociology,00:38:48.960,2.08
sociological story and so on but,00:38:51.040,2.799
let me go to something really,00:38:53.839,1.201
fascinating just because of the people,00:38:55.040,2.0
involved the human beings evolved and,00:38:57.040,2.4
because of how deeply i care about,00:38:59.440,2.639
science and also kindness respect and,00:39:02.079,2.641
love and human things,00:39:04.720,2.96
francis collins wrote a letter in,00:39:07.680,2.56
october 2020,00:39:10.240,1.92
to anthony fauci anything somebody else,00:39:12.160,3.679
i have um,00:39:15.839,2.881
the letter oh it's not a letter email i,00:39:18.960,1.84
apologize,00:39:20.800,1.2
uh hi tony and cliff,00:39:22.000,2.88
c,00:39:24.880,0.959
gb declaration.org,00:39:25.839,3.441
this proposal,00:39:29.280,1.6
this is the great barrington declaration,00:39:30.880,2.0
that you're a co-author on this proposal,00:39:32.880,2.719
from the three fringe epidemiologists,00:39:35.599,2.961
who met with the secretary seem to be,00:39:38.560,1.92
getting a lot of attention and even a,00:39:40.480,2.08
co-signature from nobel prize winner,00:39:42.560,3.36
mike levitt at stanford,00:39:45.920,2.56
there needs to be a quick and,00:39:48.480,1.68
devastating published takedown,00:39:50.160,2.959
of its premises,00:39:53.119,1.521
i don't see anything like that online,00:39:54.640,2.56
yet is it underway question mark francis,00:39:57.200,3.12
francis collins director of the nih,00:40:00.320,2.88
somebody i talked to on this podcast,00:40:03.200,1.6
recently,00:40:04.800,1.2
okay,00:40:06.000,1.599
a million questions i want to ask but,00:40:07.599,2.321
first how did that make you feel when,00:40:09.920,2.72
you first,00:40:12.640,1.12
saw this uh email come to uh,00:40:13.760,3.599
uh too light which when when when did it,00:40:17.359,2.401
come to light uh this week actually i,00:40:19.760,2.079
think or last week okay so this is,00:40:21.839,1.841
because of freedom of information yeah,00:40:23.680,2.56
which by the way,00:40:26.240,1.68
sort of um,00:40:27.920,1.76
maybe because i do want to add positive,00:40:29.680,2.08
stuff on the on the side of francis here,00:40:31.760,2.88
um,00:40:34.640,1.6
boy when i see stuff like that i wonder,00:40:36.240,2.079
if all my emails leaked,00:40:38.319,2.641
how much embarrassing stuff like i think,00:40:40.960,2.48
i'm a good person,00:40:43.440,1.52
but i don't,00:40:44.960,1.92
i haven't read my old emails maybe i'm,00:40:46.880,3.28
pretty sure sometimes later i could be,00:40:50.160,1.76
an,00:40:51.920,1.199
well i mean look he's a christian and,00:40:53.119,1.841
i'm a christian i'm supposed to forgive,00:40:54.960,1.68
right i mean i think,00:40:56.640,1.439
he was looking at this,00:40:58.079,3.361
great barrington declaration as a,00:41:01.440,1.28
political problem to be solved,00:41:02.720,2.48
as opposed to a serious alternative,00:41:05.200,2.8
approach to the epidemic,00:41:08.000,1.92
so maybe we'll talk about in more detail,00:41:09.920,2.24
but just for in case people are not,00:41:12.160,2.32
familiar great barrington declaration,00:41:14.480,1.68
was,00:41:16.160,0.88
was was the document,00:41:17.040,1.76
that you co-authored,00:41:18.800,1.92
that basically argues against this idea,00:41:20.720,2.48
of lock down as a solution to covid and,00:41:23.200,3.04
you propose another solution that we'll,00:41:26.240,2.32
talk about but the point is,00:41:28.560,2.0
it's not,00:41:30.560,1.36
that dramatic of a document,00:41:31.920,2.88
it is just a document that criticizes,00:41:34.800,2.08
one policy solution that was but it was,00:41:36.880,2.239
the policy solution that had been put,00:41:39.119,1.521
forward by,00:41:40.640,1.52
dr collins and by tony fauci,00:41:42.160,2.64
and a few other few other science not i,00:41:44.800,2.24
mean i think a relatively small number,00:41:47.040,1.76
of scientists and epidemiologists in,00:41:48.800,2.16
charge of,00:41:50.960,2.32
the advice given to governments,00:41:53.280,1.76
worldwide,00:41:55.040,1.52
and it was a challenge to that policy,00:41:56.560,3.36
that said that look there there is an,00:41:59.920,1.919
alternate path that that the path we've,00:42:01.839,2.161
chosen this path of lock down with an,00:42:04.000,2.24
aim to suppress the virus to zero,00:42:06.240,2.0
effectively i mean that was unstated um,00:42:08.240,3.04
cannot work and is causing catastrophic,00:42:11.280,2.48
harm to,00:42:13.760,1.599
large numbers of poor and vulnerable,00:42:15.359,1.521
people worldwide,00:42:16.880,2.32
we put this out in october 4th i think,00:42:19.200,2.399
of 2020,00:42:21.599,1.841
and,00:42:23.440,0.96
it went viral i mean i've never actually,00:42:24.400,2.16
been involved with anything like like,00:42:26.560,1.92
this where i just put the document on,00:42:28.480,2.16
the web,00:42:30.640,0.88
and tens of thousands of doctors signed,00:42:31.520,2.24
on hundreds of thousands of regular,00:42:33.760,1.76
people signed on,00:42:35.520,1.599
it it really struck a accord of uh,00:42:37.119,2.641
people because i think even by october,00:42:39.760,1.44
of 2020 people had this sense that there,00:42:41.200,1.919
was something really wrong,00:42:43.119,1.841
with the coveted policy that we've been,00:42:44.960,1.44
following,00:42:46.400,1.679
and they were looking for,00:42:48.079,3.121
reasonable people to give an alternative,00:42:51.200,1.6
i mean we're not arguing that covet,00:42:52.800,1.6
doesn't isn't a serious thing i mean it,00:42:54.400,2.32
is a very serious thing this is why we,00:42:56.720,1.44
we had a policy that aimed at addressing,00:42:58.160,2.56
it,00:43:00.720,0.8
um,00:43:01.520,0.799
we were but we were saying that the,00:43:02.319,2.081
policy we're following is not the right,00:43:04.400,1.919
one,00:43:06.319,1.76
so how does a democratic,00:43:08.079,2.0
uh government deal with that challenge,00:43:10.079,3.361
uh so to me that you asked me how i felt,00:43:13.440,2.399
i was actually frankly just i was i i,00:43:15.839,2.321
suspected there had been some email,00:43:18.160,1.6
exchanges like that not necessarily from,00:43:19.760,1.76
francis collins,00:43:21.520,1.52
around the government around this,00:43:23.040,1.92
time i mean i felt the full brunt of a,00:43:24.960,2.48
propaganda campaign,00:43:27.440,2.879
almost immediately after we published it,00:43:30.319,2.0
where newspapers mischaracterized it in,00:43:32.319,2.8
all in the same the same way over and,00:43:35.119,1.761
over and over again,00:43:36.880,2.32
and sought to,00:43:39.200,1.52
characterize me as sort of of a as a,00:43:40.720,2.48
sort of a marginal fringe figure or,00:43:43.200,1.44
whatnot and me and sinatra grouped uh,00:43:44.640,2.16
martin culdor for the tens of thousands,00:43:46.800,1.519
of other people that signed it,00:43:48.319,1.841
i felt the brunt of that,00:43:50.160,1.919
all year long,00:43:52.079,1.361
so to see this in black and white in you,00:43:53.440,3.36
know with the handwriting essentially if,00:43:56.800,1.6
i mean the the metaphorical handwriting,00:43:58.400,1.84
of francis collins was actually frankly,00:44:00.240,1.2
a disappointment because i i've looked,00:44:01.440,2.0
up to him for years,00:44:03.440,1.76
yeah i've looked up them as well,00:44:05.200,2.32
i um,00:44:07.520,1.839
i mean i look for the the best in people,00:44:09.359,2.72
and,00:44:12.079,1.28
i still look up to him,00:44:13.359,1.841
what troubles me is several things,00:44:15.200,3.68
the reason i said about the,00:44:19.760,2.0
the emails that i send late at,00:44:21.760,2.079
night,00:44:23.839,1.28
is um,00:44:25.119,1.681
i can understand this email,00:44:26.800,3.039
it's fear it's panic not being sure,00:44:29.839,4.321
the fringe three fringe epidemiologists,00:44:34.160,3.12
plus mike levitt who won a nobel prize i,00:44:37.280,2.48
mean but using fringe,00:44:39.760,3.359
maybe in my private thoughts i have said,00:44:43.119,2.801
things like that about others,00:44:45.920,1.919
like a little bit too unkind like you,00:44:47.839,2.721
don't really mean it,00:44:50.560,1.6
now add to that,00:44:52.160,1.84
he,00:44:54.000,0.88
recently this week whatever,00:44:54.880,2.32
uh,00:44:57.200,0.879
double down on the fringe,00:44:58.079,2.081
this is really troubling to me,00:45:00.160,2.24
that like i can excuse this email but,00:45:02.400,3.12
to see the arrogance there,00:45:05.520,2.559
i that francis honestly i mean,00:45:08.079,2.801
broke my heart a little bit there this,00:45:10.880,1.92
was an opportunity to like especially at,00:45:12.800,1.92
this stage,00:45:14.720,1.28
to say,00:45:16.000,1.52
just like i told him um,00:45:17.520,2.72
to say i was wrong to use those words in,00:45:20.240,2.0
that email,00:45:22.240,1.359
i was i was wrong to not be open to,00:45:23.599,2.641
ideas,00:45:26.240,1.04
i still believe that this is not like,00:45:27.280,2.64
say,00:45:29.920,1.04
like actually argue with the with the,00:45:30.960,2.08
proposed with the policy of the proposed,00:45:33.040,2.16
uh solution also,00:45:35.200,3.44
the devastating publish take devastating,00:45:38.720,4.08
takedown,00:45:42.800,1.44
devastating takedown as you say,00:45:44.240,2.8
somebody who's sitting,00:45:47.040,2.0
on billions of dollars that they're,00:45:49.040,2.72
giving to,00:45:51.760,1.68
scientists,00:45:53.440,1.2
some of whom are often not their best,00:45:54.640,2.56
human beings because they're fighting,00:45:57.200,1.76
with each other over money not being,00:45:58.960,2.159
cognizant of the fact that you're,00:46:01.119,3.601
challenging the integrity you're,00:46:04.960,1.84
corrupting the integrity of scientists,00:46:06.800,1.92
by allocating the money,00:46:08.720,2.0
you're now playing with that,00:46:10.720,2.639
by saying devastating takedown,00:46:13.359,2.641
where do you think the published,00:46:16.000,1.68
takedown will come from,00:46:17.680,1.76
it will come from those scientists to,00:46:19.440,2.159
whom you're giving money what kind of,00:46:21.599,2.401
example would they give to the academic,00:46:24.000,2.48
community that thrives on freedom like,00:46:26.480,2.639
this this is,00:46:29.119,1.681
i believe francis collins is a great man,00:46:30.800,3.6
one of the things i was troubled by is,00:46:34.400,2.4
the negative response to him from people,00:46:36.800,2.4
that don't understand the positive,00:46:39.200,2.159
impact that nih has had on society how,00:46:41.359,2.72
many people has helped but this is,00:46:44.079,2.721
exactly the so he's not just a scientist,00:46:46.800,3.2
he's not just a bureaucrat who,00:46:50.000,2.16
distributes money he's also a scientific,00:46:52.160,2.64
leader,00:46:54.800,0.88
that in the time in difficult times we,00:46:55.680,2.24
live in is supposed to inspire us with,00:46:57.920,2.64
trust with love with the freedom of,00:47:00.560,3.6
thought he's supposed to you know those,00:47:04.160,2.4
fringe epidemiologists those are the,00:47:06.560,2.559
heroes of science when you look at the,00:47:09.119,2.561
long arc of history we love those people,00:47:11.680,3.84
we love ideas even when they get proven,00:47:15.520,2.24
wrong that's what always that attracted,00:47:17.760,1.76
me to science like some somebody like,00:47:19.520,2.24
the the lone voice saying oh no the the,00:47:21.760,3.28
the moon of jupiter does move,00:47:25.040,3.12
yeah i mean you know but the funny thing,00:47:28.160,1.679
is you know galileo is saying something,00:47:29.839,2.0
truly revolutionary we were saying,00:47:31.839,2.0
that what we proposed in the great,00:47:33.839,1.201
britain declaration was actually just,00:47:35.040,1.68
the old pandemic plan,00:47:36.720,2.08
it wasn't anything really,00:47:38.800,1.92
fundamentally novel,00:47:40.720,2.32
in fact there were,00:47:43.040,1.76
plans like this that,00:47:44.800,3.2
lockdown scientists had written in late,00:47:48.000,2.559
february early march of 2020. so we were,00:47:50.559,2.481
not saying anything radical we were just,00:47:53.040,1.68
calling for a debate,00:47:54.720,1.599
effectively over the existing lockdown,00:47:56.319,2.721
policy,00:47:59.040,1.279
um and this is a disappointment a really,00:48:00.319,2.721
truly a big disappointment because,00:48:03.040,2.48
by doing this,00:48:05.520,1.599
you were absolutely right lex he sent a,00:48:07.119,1.921
signal,00:48:09.040,1.039
to so many other scientists to just stay,00:48:10.079,2.641
silent even if you had reservations,00:48:12.720,2.32
yeah devastating takedown the people you,00:48:15.040,3.279
know how many people wrote to me,00:48:18.319,1.841
privately like stanford mit,00:48:20.160,3.6
how amazing,00:48:23.760,1.52
the conversation with francis collins,00:48:25.280,1.839
was,00:48:27.119,0.96
there's a kind of admiration because,00:48:28.079,3.681
okay how do i put it um,00:48:31.760,4.0
a lot of people,00:48:35.760,1.599
get into science because they want to,00:48:37.359,1.521
help the world,00:48:38.880,1.439
they get excited by the ideas and they,00:48:40.319,2.321
and they they really are working hard to,00:48:42.640,2.8
help in whatever the discipline is and,00:48:45.440,2.56
then there is sources of funding,00:48:48.000,2.64
which help you do help at a larger scale,00:48:50.640,2.56
so you admire those the people that uh,00:48:53.200,2.879
um,00:48:56.079,0.881
are distributing the money because,00:48:56.960,1.52
they're often,00:48:58.480,1.2
at least on the surface are really also,00:48:59.680,2.399
good people oftentimes they're great,00:49:02.079,1.681
scientists so like it's amazing i that's,00:49:03.760,3.2
why i'm sort of um,00:49:06.960,3.599
like sometimes people from outside think,00:49:10.559,1.681
academia is broken some kind of way no,00:49:12.240,2.48
it's it's a beautiful thing it's a it's,00:49:14.720,2.08
really is a beautiful thing and that's,00:49:16.800,1.279
why it's so deeply heartbreaking where,00:49:18.079,1.841
this person,00:49:19.920,1.52
um,00:49:21.440,1.119
is um i don't think this is malevolence,00:49:22.559,3.76
i think he's just incompetence of,00:49:26.319,2.24
communication,00:49:28.559,1.921
twice i think there's there's also,00:49:30.480,1.68
arrogance at the bottom of it too so,00:49:32.160,1.6
like but you know all of us have,00:49:33.760,1.52
arrogance yeah there's a particular kind,00:49:35.280,1.92
of arrogance right so here it's it's of,00:49:37.200,1.84
the same kind of arrogance that you see,00:49:39.040,2.16
when tony fauci gets on tv and says that,00:49:41.200,3.28
uh that if you criticize me you're not,00:49:44.480,2.32
simply criticizing a man you're,00:49:46.800,1.759
criticizing science itself right right,00:49:48.559,2.401
that is at the heart also of this email,00:49:50.960,3.92
this so the certainty,00:49:54.880,2.08
that the policies that they were,00:49:56.960,1.84
recommending collins and fauci were,00:49:58.800,1.6
recommending to the president of the,00:50:00.400,1.36
united states were right not just right,00:50:01.760,2.319
but right so so far right that any,00:50:04.079,2.881
challenge whatsoever to it is dangerous,00:50:06.960,3.52
um and i think that that is really the,00:50:10.480,2.24
heart of that email it's it's um it's,00:50:12.720,2.0
this idea that,00:50:14.720,2.56
my position is unchallengeable,00:50:17.280,2.4
not to be to be complete to be as,00:50:19.680,2.159
charitable as i can be to this you know,00:50:21.839,2.641
i believe they thought that i believe,00:50:24.480,1.44
they some of them still think that that,00:50:25.920,2.159
that there was only one true policy,00:50:28.079,2.641
possible in response to copenhagen every,00:50:30.720,2.08
other policy was immoral,00:50:32.800,3.279
and if you if you come from that,00:50:36.079,1.201
position then you write an email like,00:50:37.280,1.52
that you go on tv you say effectively,00:50:38.800,3.44
right i mean that that is that is what,00:50:42.240,1.68
happens when you have this sort of,00:50:43.920,2.32
unchallengeable arrogance that the,00:50:46.240,1.52
policy you're following is correct,00:50:47.760,1.839
um i mean when we wrote the great bank,00:50:49.599,1.52
declaration,00:50:51.119,0.96
what i was hoping for,00:50:52.079,1.601
was a discussion,00:50:53.680,1.919
about how to protect the vulnerable i,00:50:55.599,2.081
mean that was the key idea to me in the,00:50:57.680,1.76
whole thing was,00:50:59.440,1.36
better protection of the older,00:51:00.800,1.519
population who really at really serious,00:51:02.319,2.0
risk if infected with covid and we had,00:51:04.319,2.24
been doing a very poor job i thought to,00:51:06.559,2.081
date in many places in protecting the,00:51:08.640,1.76
vulnerable,00:51:10.400,1.76
and what i wanted was a discussion by,00:51:12.160,2.64
local public health,00:51:14.800,1.68
about better methods better policies to,00:51:16.480,2.24
protect the vulnerable,00:51:18.720,2.639
so when when i was when we were met with,00:51:21.359,2.96
instead a series of essentially,00:51:24.319,2.321
propagandist lies about it so they for,00:51:26.640,2.24
instance i kept hearing from reporters,00:51:28.880,2.56
in in those days why do you want to let,00:51:31.440,2.159
the virus rip let it rip let it rip the,00:51:33.599,2.24
words let it rip,00:51:35.839,1.681
does not appear in the great barrington,00:51:37.520,2.48
declaration,00:51:40.000,1.2
the goal isn't to let the virus rip um,00:51:41.200,2.399
the goal is to protect the vulnerable,00:51:43.599,2.321
to let society go as you know open,00:51:45.920,3.199
schools and do other things that it,00:51:49.119,1.841
functions as best it can in the midst of,00:51:50.960,1.52
a terrible pandemic yes,00:51:52.480,2.24
but not let the virus rip,00:51:54.720,2.48
where no the most vulnerable are,00:51:57.200,1.68
protected the goal was to protect the,00:51:58.880,1.52
vulnerable so why let it rip because it,00:52:00.400,2.48
was a propaganda term to hit the fear,00:52:02.880,2.959
centers of people's brains oh these,00:52:05.839,2.0
people are immoral they just want to let,00:52:07.839,1.681
the virus go through society and hurt,00:52:09.520,1.599
everybody that was that was that was the,00:52:11.119,1.841
idea this it was a way to preclude a,00:52:12.960,2.72
discussion and preclude a debate about,00:52:15.680,2.48
the existing policy,00:52:18.160,1.76
so i've uh,00:52:19.920,1.52
this is an app called clubhouse,00:52:21.440,2.879
um i've gone back on it recently,00:52:24.319,3.441
uh to practice russian unrelated for for,00:52:27.760,3.04
a few big russian conversations coming,00:52:30.800,1.759
up anyway it's a great way to talk to,00:52:32.559,1.841
regular people in russian but i also,00:52:34.400,2.0
there was a i was i was nervous i was,00:52:36.400,2.08
preparing for a pfizer ceo conversation,00:52:38.480,2.16
and there was a vaccine room and so i,00:52:40.640,2.16
joined it,00:52:42.800,1.92
and there's a there's a pro science room,00:52:44.720,3.28
as they they these are like scientists,00:52:48.000,1.92
that were calling each other pro science,00:52:49.920,2.24
it the whole thing was like theater to,00:52:52.160,2.72
me i mean i haven't thoroughly,00:52:54.880,1.76
researched but looking at the resume,00:52:56.640,1.439
they were like,00:52:58.079,1.361
pretty solid um,00:52:59.440,2.399
researchers and doctors,00:53:01.839,2.161
and they were mocking,00:53:04.000,2.24
everybody,00:53:06.240,2.319
who was at all i mean it doesn't matter,00:53:08.559,2.321
what they stood for but they were just,00:53:10.880,1.439
mocking people and the arrogance was,00:53:12.319,2.24
overwhelming i had to shut off,00:53:14.559,3.04
because i couldn't handle that human,00:53:17.599,2.0
beings can be like this to each other,00:53:19.599,1.841
and then i i went back to just a double,00:53:21.440,2.639
check is this really how many people are,00:53:24.079,2.161
here is this theater and then i uh asked,00:53:26.240,3.599
to come on stage on clubhouse to make a,00:53:29.839,2.0
couple comments and then as i open my,00:53:31.839,2.24
mouth and say thank you so much you know,00:53:34.079,2.0
this is this is a great room sort of the,00:53:36.079,2.161
usual civil politeness all that kind of,00:53:38.240,2.079
stuff,00:53:40.319,1.28
and,00:53:41.599,1.601
i said i'm worried that,00:53:43.200,2.639
the kind of arrogance with which,00:53:45.839,3.52
things are being discussed here,00:53:49.359,2.161
will further divide us not,00:53:51.520,2.96
unite us and and before,00:53:54.480,2.4
i said even the united further divide us,00:53:56.880,3.52
i was thrown off stage now this isn't,00:54:00.400,2.4
why i mentioned platform but like i am,00:54:02.800,2.799
like uh lex friedman mit,00:54:05.599,3.201
uh also which is something those people,00:54:08.800,2.799
seem to sometimes care about the,00:54:11.599,1.841
followers and stuff like that like did,00:54:13.440,3.04
you just do that and then they said,00:54:16.480,2.48
enough of that nonsense,00:54:18.960,2.08
enough of that nonsense they said to me,00:54:21.040,4.24
enough of that nonsense,00:54:25.280,2.079
somebody who is obviously interviewed,00:54:27.359,2.48
francis collins,00:54:29.839,1.681
is uh uh the pfizer ceo uh you're,00:54:31.520,3.52
bringing a potential epidemiologist also,00:54:35.040,2.0
so just yeah exactly but this broke my,00:54:37.040,2.48
heart the arrogance and this is echoes,00:54:39.520,2.72
of that arrogance is something you see,00:54:42.240,1.44
in this email and i really would love to,00:54:43.680,2.48
have a million things to talk about to,00:54:46.160,1.36
try to figure out how can we find a path,00:54:47.520,2.24
forward i think a lot of,00:54:49.760,1.92
a lot of the problems,00:54:51.680,1.84
we've seen in the,00:54:53.520,2.079
the discussion over cove especially in,00:54:55.599,1.76
the scientific community,00:54:57.359,1.601
you know there's there's two ways to,00:54:58.960,1.44
look at science i think uh that that,00:55:00.400,2.24
have been competing with each other for,00:55:02.640,1.6
a while now,00:55:04.240,2.0
one way and this is the way that i view,00:55:06.240,2.079
science and why i've always found it so,00:55:08.319,1.52
attractive,00:55:09.839,1.041
is an invitation to a structured,00:55:10.880,2.08
discussion,00:55:12.960,1.2
where,00:55:14.160,1.199
the the discussion is tempered by by,00:55:15.359,2.161
evidence by data by by reasoning and,00:55:17.520,3.12
logic,00:55:20.640,1.04
right so it's a dialectical process,00:55:21.680,2.159
where if i believe a and you believe b,00:55:23.839,3.041
well uh we talk about it we come up with,00:55:26.880,3.12
an experiment that distinguishes between,00:55:30.000,1.68
the two and while you know b turns out,00:55:31.680,2.48
to be right i'm i'm all frustrated but i,00:55:34.160,2.0
buy you dinner and i say no no no c and,00:55:36.160,2.32
then we go on from there right that's,00:55:38.480,2.319
that's what science is at its best it's,00:55:40.799,2.641
this process of using data in discussion,00:55:43.440,2.879
it's a human activity right uh to to to,00:55:46.319,3.121
learn,00:55:49.440,1.119
to let have the truth unfold itself,00:55:50.559,2.161
before us,00:55:52.720,1.359
on the other hand there are,00:55:54.079,2.401
there's another way that people have,00:55:56.480,1.359
used science or thought about science as,00:55:57.839,2.161
a as truth in and of itself,00:56:00.000,3.04
right this like if it's if it's science,00:56:03.040,1.759
therefore it's true automatically and,00:56:04.799,2.241
they're,00:56:07.040,1.039
you know what does the science say to do,00:56:08.079,2.0
well the science never says to do,00:56:10.079,1.601
anything the science says here's what's,00:56:11.680,1.679
true and then we have to,00:56:13.359,1.601
apply our human values,00:56:14.960,2.24
to say okay well if we do this well then,00:56:17.200,3.44
this is likely to happen that's what the,00:56:20.640,1.439
science says if we do that then that is,00:56:22.079,2.161
likely to happen well we'd rather have,00:56:24.240,1.599
this than that right and but it doesn't,00:56:25.839,2.561
science doesn't tell us that we'd rather,00:56:28.400,1.36
have this than that is there human,00:56:29.760,1.039
values that tell us that we'd rather,00:56:30.799,1.28
this and that science plays a role but,00:56:32.079,1.841
it's not the only thing,00:56:33.920,1.679
uh it's not the only role it's like it,00:56:35.599,2.161
helps us understand the constraints we,00:56:37.760,1.68
face but it doesn't tell us what to do,00:56:39.440,2.08
in face of those constraints,00:56:41.520,1.599
but underneath it at the individual,00:56:43.119,2.081
level at the institutional level it,00:56:45.200,1.76
seems like,00:56:46.960,1.76
um,00:56:48.720,0.879
arrogance,00:56:49.599,1.601
is really destructive so the flip side,00:56:51.200,2.24
of that the productive thing is humility,00:56:53.440,2.24
so sort of um,00:56:55.680,3.119
always not being,00:56:58.799,2.32
sure that you're right,00:57:01.119,1.761
this is actually kind of uh,00:57:02.880,2.08
stuart russell talks about this for ai,00:57:04.960,2.24
research how do you make sure that ai,00:57:07.200,2.159
super intelligent ai doesn't destroy us,00:57:09.359,1.841
you built in um,00:57:11.200,2.399
a sort of module within it that it,00:57:13.599,2.0
always doubts,00:57:15.599,1.921
its actions like it's not sure,00:57:17.520,2.4
like i know it says i'm supposed to,00:57:19.920,2.0
destroy all humans but maybe i'm wrong,00:57:21.920,2.8
and that maybe i'm wrong is essential,00:57:24.720,2.24
for progress for actually doing in the,00:57:26.960,2.08
long arc of history better not the,00:57:29.040,2.079
perfect thing but better and better and,00:57:31.119,1.361
better and better i mean the the,00:57:32.480,1.52
question i have here for you is,00:57:34.000,2.559
this,00:57:36.559,1.361
this email so clearly captures some,00:57:37.920,3.199
maybe echo but maybe a core to the,00:57:41.119,2.081
problem do you put responsibility of,00:57:43.200,2.639
this email of the shortcomings,00:57:45.839,3.041
and failures on individuals or,00:57:48.880,2.16
institutions,00:57:51.040,2.48
no this is an institutional failure,00:57:53.520,1.52
right so um the nih i so i've had two,00:57:55.040,3.039
decades of nih funding i've sat on nih,00:57:58.079,1.841
review panels the purpose of the nih is,00:57:59.920,2.56
what you said earlier lex the purpose of,00:58:02.480,1.68
nih is to support the work of scientists,00:58:04.160,3.76
to some extent it's also how to help,00:58:07.920,2.08
scientists to direct scientists to work,00:58:10.000,2.16
on things that are very important for,00:58:12.160,1.52
public health or for the health of the,00:58:13.680,1.679
public,00:58:15.359,1.2
um so and the way you do that is you say,00:58:16.559,2.0
okay we're gonna put,00:58:18.559,1.441
you know 50 million dollars on uh the,00:58:20.000,2.24
research in alzheimer's disease this,00:58:22.240,1.92
year or 70 million dollars on hiv or,00:58:24.160,1.84
whatever it is right some and uh that,00:58:26.000,2.24
pot of money then uh scientists compete,00:58:28.240,2.48
with each other for the best ideas to to,00:58:30.720,2.16
use it to address that that problem so,00:58:32.880,3.36
it's essentially an endeavor to support,00:58:36.240,2.559
the work of scientists it is not in and,00:58:38.799,2.8
of itself a policy organ,00:58:41.599,3.361
it doesn't say what public health policy,00:58:44.960,2.48
should be,00:58:47.440,1.52
for that you have the cdc,00:58:48.960,3.28
and,00:58:52.400,0.8
what happened during the pandemic is,00:58:53.200,2.24
that,00:58:55.440,0.96
people,00:58:56.400,1.04
in the nih were called upon,00:58:57.440,2.72
to contribute to public health making,00:59:00.160,4.639
and that created the conflict of,00:59:04.799,1.681
interest you see in that email,00:59:06.480,2.24
right so now you have the head of the,00:59:08.720,2.879
nih,00:59:11.599,1.2
in effect saying to all scientists you,00:59:12.799,2.32
must agree with me,00:59:15.119,1.841
in the policies that i've recommended,00:59:16.960,3.839
or else you're fringe,00:59:20.799,2.721
that is a deep conflict of interest it's,00:59:23.520,1.839
deep because first he he's conflicted he,00:59:25.359,2.161
has this dual role as,00:59:27.520,1.839
as as the head of the nih,00:59:29.359,2.161
supporter of scientific funding and then,00:59:31.520,1.76
also,00:59:33.280,1.2
inappropriately called to set or help,00:59:34.480,2.319
set,00:59:36.799,0.961
pandemic policy,00:59:37.760,1.599
that should never have happened there,00:59:39.359,1.521
should be a bright line between those,00:59:40.880,2.64
two roles,00:59:43.520,1.839
let me ask you about just francis,00:59:45.359,1.361
collins i don't know if you i i had a,00:59:46.720,1.76
chance to talk to him on a podcast i,00:59:48.480,1.28
don't know if you maybe by chance gotten,00:59:49.760,1.599
a chance to hear a few words of it,00:59:51.359,2.48
um well i have a kind of a question uh,00:59:53.839,2.401
to that because a lot of people,00:59:56.240,3.2
wrote to me quite negative things about,00:59:59.440,2.08
francis collins and like i said i still,01:00:01.520,2.079
believe,01:00:03.599,1.281
he's a great man a great scientist,01:00:04.880,2.719
um,01:00:07.599,1.681
one of the things when i,01:00:09.280,1.6
talked to him off mike,01:00:10.880,2.479
about the vaccine,01:00:13.359,3.041
the excitement he had about when we were,01:00:16.799,3.04
recollecting when they first got an,01:00:19.839,3.121
inkling that it's actually going to be,01:00:22.960,1.76
possible to get a vaccine,01:00:24.720,2.079
just he wasn't messaging just in the,01:00:26.799,2.641
private or of our own conversation he,01:00:29.440,1.919
was really excited and why was he,01:00:31.359,2.0
excited because he gets to help a lot of,01:00:33.359,2.24
people this is a man,01:00:35.599,2.321
that really wants to help people and,01:00:37.920,3.12
there could be some institutional,01:00:41.040,1.68
self-delusion the arrogance all those,01:00:42.720,1.68
kinds of things that lead to this kind,01:00:44.400,2.159
of email but ultimately the the goal is,01:00:46.559,2.24
this is what i don't think people quite,01:00:48.799,1.601
realize this,01:00:50.400,1.28
the reason you call your fringe,01:00:51.680,1.919
epidemiologist the reason there needs to,01:00:53.599,2.48
be a devastating uh published takedown,01:00:56.079,2.881
he i believe really believes,01:00:58.960,2.879
that this it could be very dangerous,01:01:01.839,3.201
yeah and,01:01:05.040,1.44
it's a lot of burden to carry on his,01:01:06.480,2.24
shoulders because like you said in his,01:01:08.720,2.0
role where he defines some of the public,01:01:10.720,1.839
policy,01:01:12.559,1.76
like,01:01:14.319,1.04
you know depending on how he thinks,01:01:15.359,2.321
about the world,01:01:17.680,1.28
millions of people could die because of,01:01:18.960,1.76
one decision he make yeah and that's a,01:01:20.720,2.48
lot of burden to walk with yeah no i,01:01:23.200,2.08
think that's right i don't think that he,01:01:25.280,1.68
has bad intentions,01:01:26.960,2.32
i think that he was,01:01:29.280,1.44
basically put was put or maybe put,01:01:30.720,2.32
himself in a position where,01:01:33.040,3.2
this kind of conflict of interest was,01:01:36.240,1.839
going to create this kind of this this,01:01:38.079,2.24
kind of a reaction,01:01:40.319,2.0
right the kind of humility that you're,01:01:42.319,1.441
calling for is almost impossible when,01:01:43.760,1.839
you have that dual dual role this that,01:01:45.599,2.641
shouldn't you shouldn't have to have as,01:01:48.240,2.079
as funder of science and also center of,01:01:50.319,2.081
scientific policy i agree with,01:01:52.400,1.36
everything you just said except the last,01:01:53.760,1.279
part the the humility is almost,01:01:55.039,2.32
impossible that,01:01:57.359,1.921
uh,01:01:59.280,0.72
humility is always difficult i think,01:02:00.000,2.559
i think there's a huge incentive to for,01:02:02.559,2.321
humility in that position,01:02:04.880,1.6
now look at history,01:02:06.480,2.079
great leaders that have humility,01:02:08.559,4.24
are popular as hell,01:02:12.799,1.601
so if you like being popular,01:02:14.400,2.24
if you like having impact legacy,01:02:16.640,2.88
these descendants of apes seem to care,01:02:19.520,1.839
about legacy especially as they get,01:02:21.359,1.841
older in these high positions like i i,01:02:23.200,3.119
think the incentive for humility is,01:02:26.319,1.361
pretty high well i mean the thing is is,01:02:27.680,1.52
like there's a lot that he has to be,01:02:29.200,1.76
proud of in his career i mean like the,01:02:30.960,2.0
human genome project,01:02:32.960,1.44
wouldn't have happened without him uh,01:02:34.400,1.76
and he is he is a great man and a great,01:02:36.160,2.159
scientist but so it is tragic to me that,01:02:38.319,2.72
his career has ended in this particular,01:02:41.039,1.681
way,01:02:42.720,1.839
he asked you a question about um,01:02:44.559,3.201
my podcast conversation with them,01:02:47.760,2.799
by way of advice or maybe criticism,01:02:50.559,3.76
there's a lot of people that wrote to me,01:02:54.319,1.921
kind words of support,01:02:56.240,1.92
and,01:02:58.160,0.959
a lot of people that wrote to me,01:02:59.119,1.601
respectful constructive criticism,01:03:00.720,2.56
how would you suggest to have,01:03:03.280,2.0
conversations with folks like that,01:03:05.280,2.48
and,01:03:07.760,0.96
maybe um i mean because there's i have,01:03:08.720,2.8
other conversations like this including,01:03:11.520,1.76
i was debating whether to talk to,01:03:13.280,2.72
anthony fauci he wanted to talk,01:03:16.000,3.119
and so,01:03:19.119,1.601
what kind of conversation do you have,01:03:20.720,1.92
and sorry to take us on a tangent but,01:03:22.640,2.0
almost from an interview,01:03:24.640,1.679
perspective of how to inspire humility,01:03:26.319,2.8
and inspire trust,01:03:29.119,1.92
in science or maybe give hope that we,01:03:31.039,2.161
know what the heck we're doing and we're,01:03:33.200,1.359
going to figure this out i mean i think,01:03:34.559,2.641
you're,01:03:37.200,1.119
i've been now interviewed by many people,01:03:38.319,1.921
um,01:03:40.240,0.799
i think uh,01:03:41.039,1.601
the style you have really works well lex,01:03:42.640,1.76
you have to you because you i don't,01:03:44.400,1.6
think you're going to be ever an attack,01:03:46.000,2.0
dog,01:03:48.000,0.88
trying to go after somebody and and,01:03:48.880,2.0
force them to to like,01:03:50.880,2.0
you know admit that they were wrong,01:03:52.880,1.439
about or whatever about i mean that's,01:03:54.319,1.921
that i also actually find that form of,01:03:56.240,1.599
journalism and podcasting really,01:03:57.839,2.0
off-putting it's hard to watch,01:03:59.839,2.161
also it's a whole lot of the tangent is,01:04:02.000,2.079
that actually effective i don't think so,01:04:04.079,1.921
do you want to ask,01:04:06.000,2.0
hitler,01:04:08.000,1.039
and i think about this a lot actually,01:04:09.039,1.28
interviewing hitler i've been studying a,01:04:10.319,1.201
lot about the the the rise and the fall,01:04:11.520,1.92
of the third reich,01:04:13.440,1.52
i think about interviewing stalin like i,01:04:14.960,1.839
put myself in that mindset like how do,01:04:16.799,2.721
you,01:04:19.520,1.039
have conversations with people to,01:04:20.559,2.161
understand who they are so that not so,01:04:22.720,2.639
you can sit there and yell at them yeah,01:04:25.359,2.641
but to understand who they are so that,01:04:28.000,1.52
you can inspire a very large number of,01:04:29.520,2.16
people to be the best version of,01:04:31.680,1.6
themselves and to avoid the mistakes of,01:04:33.280,2.319
the past i believe that everyone,01:04:35.599,2.72
that's involved in this debate has good,01:04:38.319,1.76
intentions they have they're coming at,01:04:40.079,2.161
it from their points of view uh they,01:04:42.240,1.92
they don't they have um,01:04:44.160,2.159
uh they have their weaknesses,01:04:46.319,1.76
and if you can paint a picture in your,01:04:48.079,2.0
questioning by sympathetic questioning,01:04:50.079,2.641
of those strengths and weaknesses and,01:04:52.720,2.48
their point of view you've done a,01:04:55.200,1.119
service um that's really all you i,01:04:56.319,2.48
personally like like to see in those,01:04:58.799,1.841
kinds of interviews um i don't think a,01:05:00.640,2.159
gotcha moment,01:05:02.799,1.76
uh is really the key thing there the the,01:05:04.559,2.161
key thing is understanding where they're,01:05:06.720,1.52
coming from understanding their thinking,01:05:08.240,2.319
understanding the constraints they faced,01:05:10.559,1.681
and how did they manage them that's,01:05:12.240,2.079
going to provide a much i mean for me,01:05:14.319,1.921
that's what i look for when i when i,01:05:16.240,1.28
listen to podcasts like yours,01:05:17.520,1.92
um is is an understanding of that of,01:05:19.440,2.0
that of that person,01:05:21.440,1.84
and the moment and how they dealt with,01:05:23.280,2.079
it,01:05:25.359,0.801
i mean i guess the hope is,01:05:26.160,2.159
to discover in a sympathetic way a flaw,01:05:28.319,2.881
in a person's thinking together,01:05:31.200,2.56
like,01:05:33.760,1.039
as opposed to discovering the positive,01:05:34.799,1.601
thing together you discover,01:05:36.400,2.0
the thing well i didn't really think,01:05:38.400,1.84
about that yeah i mean that's what,01:05:40.240,1.28
that's how science is right that's why,01:05:41.520,1.839
we found it i think find it so,01:05:43.359,1.281
attractive is this i i i like it when a,01:05:44.640,3.84
student shows me i'm thinking,01:05:48.480,1.68
incorrectly,01:05:50.160,1.28
right i think i'm really grateful to,01:05:51.440,1.84
that student because now i have an,01:05:53.280,2.079
opportunity to change my mind about it,01:05:55.359,1.76
and then start thinking even more,01:05:57.119,1.281
correctly i mean that's,01:05:58.400,1.6
and there are moments when,01:06:00.000,2.319
uh i mean like this is probably a good,01:06:02.319,2.081
time to say like what i think i got,01:06:04.400,1.439
wrong,01:06:05.839,0.881
during the pandemic right so like for,01:06:06.720,1.52
instance you said francis collins had a,01:06:08.240,1.92
moment when uh he learned that that,01:06:10.160,3.04
there was quite possible to get a,01:06:13.200,1.76
vaccine going yeah he must have learned,01:06:14.960,2.159
that quite early,01:06:17.119,1.841
and i didn't learn that early,01:06:18.960,2.399
i mean i i didn't know,01:06:21.359,2.161
in march of 2020,01:06:23.520,2.24
in my experience with vaccine,01:06:25.760,1.68
development it would have take i thought,01:06:27.440,1.84
it would take a decade or more to get a,01:06:29.280,1.68
vaccine,01:06:30.960,2.0
that was wrong right i didn't that that,01:06:32.960,2.32
and and i was so happy when i started to,01:06:35.280,3.2
see the preliminary numbers,01:06:38.480,1.839
in the in the pfizer trial,01:06:40.319,2.0
that strongly suggested it was going to,01:06:42.319,2.0
work,01:06:44.319,1.921
yeah and at the i was,01:06:46.240,2.079
i mean like very few times in my life,01:06:48.319,1.201
i'm so happy to be wrong,01:06:49.520,2.319
and it changes kind of,01:06:51.839,2.0
um i think i've heard you mention that,01:06:53.839,1.921
lockdown is still a bad idea,01:06:55.760,2.64
unless the vaccine comes out in like,01:06:58.400,1.84
tomorrow,01:07:00.240,1.119
uh there's still like,01:07:01.359,2.48
suffering and economic pain all kinds of,01:07:03.839,1.841
pain can still happen in even just a a,01:07:05.680,2.639
scale of weeks,01:07:08.319,1.441
um,01:07:09.760,1.92
versus months,01:07:11.680,1.439
yeah well let's talk about the vaccine,01:07:13.119,3.121
what are your thoughts on the safety and,01:07:16.240,2.0
efficacy of covered vaccines at the,01:07:18.240,2.319
individual and the societal level so for,01:07:20.559,2.881
the the vaccine safety data,01:07:23.440,2.72
it's it's actually challenging,01:07:26.160,2.48
to convey to the public how this is,01:07:28.640,2.0
normally done like normally you would do,01:07:30.640,1.76
this in the context of the trial you'd,01:07:32.400,2.08
have a law a long trial with large,01:07:34.480,1.839
numbers relatively large numbers of,01:07:36.319,1.52
people you'd follow them over a long,01:07:37.839,1.841
time and the trial will give you some,01:07:39.680,1.359
indication of the safety of the vaccine,01:07:41.039,2.641
and it did um i mean but,01:07:43.680,2.56
you the the the trial the way it was,01:07:46.240,2.16
constructed,01:07:48.400,1.199
when it was came out that it was,01:07:49.599,1.921
protective against covet it was no,01:07:51.520,1.519
longer ethical to have a placebo arm,01:07:53.039,3.201
and so that placebo arm is vaccinated,01:07:56.240,1.68
what large part of it,01:07:57.920,2.159
and so that meant that from the trial,01:08:00.079,2.081
you are not going to be able to get,01:08:02.160,2.48
data on the long-term safety profiles of,01:08:04.640,2.32
the vaccine,01:08:06.960,2.0
uh and also the other thing about trials,01:08:08.960,1.68
although there's tens of thousands of,01:08:10.640,1.6
people enrolled that's still not enough,01:08:12.240,1.68
to get when you when it when you deploy,01:08:13.920,2.318
a vaccine to the population scale you're,01:08:16.238,2.722
going to see things that weren't in the,01:08:18.960,1.198
trial,01:08:20.158,0.962
guaranteed,01:08:21.120,1.76
populations of people that weren't,01:08:22.880,1.12
represented well in the trial are going,01:08:24.000,1.839
to are going to be given the vaccine and,01:08:25.839,2.081
then that they're going to have things,01:08:27.920,1.359
that happen to them that you didn't,01:08:29.279,1.281
didn't anticipate,01:08:30.560,1.678
so,01:08:32.238,1.121
i wasn't surprised when people were a,01:08:33.359,1.839
little bit skeptical when the trial was,01:08:35.198,1.842
done about the safety profile just the,01:08:37.040,1.84
way the nature of the thing was going to,01:08:38.880,1.358
make it so that it was going to be hard,01:08:40.238,1.842
to get a complete picture from the,01:08:42.080,1.759
trials itself and the trials showed they,01:08:43.839,2.241
were pretty safe,01:08:46.080,1.44
and quite effective at preventing,01:08:47.520,3.199
both you from getting covid actually i,01:08:50.719,2.241
think the main endpoint of the trial,01:08:52.960,1.519
itself was a symptomatic covet,01:08:54.479,3.041
right so um uh so that was like that was,01:08:57.520,3.44
you know i mean it was really um,01:09:00.960,2.238
to me like is about as amazing,01:09:03.198,2.402
achievement as anything organizing a,01:09:05.600,1.52
trial of that scale and running it so,01:09:07.120,2.4
quickly,01:09:09.520,1.12
and the final results being so,01:09:10.640,2.32
surprisingly high so good right,01:09:12.960,2.96
and um so,01:09:15.920,1.519
the but the problem then was normally it,01:09:17.439,3.28
would take a long time the fda would,01:09:20.719,3.361
tell pfizer to go back and try it in,01:09:24.080,1.84
this subgroup they'd work more on dosing,01:09:25.920,2.559
they'd do all these kinds of things,01:09:28.479,2.481
that kind of didn't we really didn't,01:09:30.960,1.6
have time for in the middle of a,01:09:32.560,1.119
pandemic right so you have a you have,01:09:33.679,2.8
a basis for approval that it's less,01:09:36.479,3.92
full than normally you would have for a,01:09:40.399,2.161
population scale vaccine,01:09:42.560,2.56
but the results were good results looked,01:09:45.120,1.84
really good and actually i should say,01:09:46.960,1.68
for the most part that's been borne out,01:09:48.640,2.48
when we've given the vaccine at scale in,01:09:51.120,1.92
terms of protection against severe,01:09:53.040,1.679
disease,01:09:54.719,1.121
yeah all right so people who have got,01:09:55.840,1.76
the vaccine,01:09:57.600,1.28
um for a very long time after they've,01:09:58.880,1.839
had that for the full vaccination have,01:10:00.719,2.081
had great protection against going being,01:10:02.800,3.04
hospitalized and dying if they get,01:10:05.840,1.76
covered let's separate because this,01:10:07.600,2.72
seems to be,01:10:10.320,1.6
um,01:10:11.920,0.88
there's critics of both categories but,01:10:12.800,2.08
different kids,01:10:14.880,2.24
and,01:10:17.120,0.8
kids and,01:10:17.920,1.6
old not older people like uh,01:10:19.520,2.32
let's say five years old and above or,01:10:21.840,2.0
something like they're 13 years old and,01:10:23.840,1.44
above so,01:10:25.280,2.399
for those it seems like the reduction,01:10:27.679,3.761
of uh the rate of fatalities and and,01:10:31.440,3.04
serious illness seems to be something,01:10:34.480,2.239
like 10x,01:10:36.719,1.361
i mean for older people it is a godsend,01:10:38.080,3.04
this vaccine it it transforms the the,01:10:41.120,3.599
problem of focus protection from,01:10:44.719,2.401
something that's quite challenging,01:10:47.120,2.0
possible i believe but quite challenging,01:10:49.120,1.599
to something that's much much more,01:10:50.719,1.281
manageable because the vaccine in and of,01:10:52.000,2.4
itself when deployed in older,01:10:54.400,2.08
populations is a form of focus,01:10:56.480,1.6
protection,01:10:58.080,1.92
yes well by the way we'll talk about the,01:11:00.000,2.239
focus protection in one segment because,01:11:02.239,2.081
it's such a brilliant idea for this,01:11:04.320,1.68
pandemic of future pandemics i thought,01:11:06.000,2.719
the sociological psychological,01:11:08.719,1.921
discussion about the letter from francis,01:11:10.640,2.4
collins is um,01:11:13.040,2.08
because it was so recent it was been so,01:11:15.120,1.52
troubling to me so i'm glad we talked,01:11:16.640,1.68
about that first,01:11:18.320,1.76
but so the there seems to be,01:11:20.080,3.2
the vaccines work to reduce deaths,01:11:23.280,3.919
and that has especially the most,01:11:27.199,2.48
transformative effects for the older so,01:11:29.679,2.641
can i let you give i've told you one,01:11:32.320,1.44
thing that i got wrong in the panic let,01:11:33.760,1.28
me tell you the second thing i got wrong,01:11:35.040,1.36
for sure in the pandemic,01:11:36.400,1.759
in january of la of this year,01:11:38.159,3.601
2021 i thought that the vaccines would,01:11:41.760,3.52
stop infection,01:11:45.280,2.64
yes right it would would make it so that,01:11:47.920,2.319
you were much less likely to be infected,01:11:50.239,2.241
at all,01:11:52.480,0.96
because the the antibodies that were,01:11:53.440,1.92
produced by the vaccines looked like,01:11:55.360,1.28
they were neutralizing antibodies that,01:11:56.640,1.599
would would essentially block you from,01:11:58.239,1.601
being infected at all,01:11:59.840,2.96
um,01:12:02.800,1.04
that turned out to be wrong,01:12:03.840,2.0
right so i think it became clear,01:12:05.840,3.28
as data came out from israel which,01:12:09.120,2.16
vaccinated very early that they were,01:12:11.280,1.6
seeing surges of infection even in a,01:12:12.880,2.4
very highly vaccinated population,01:12:15.280,2.56
that,01:12:17.840,0.96
that the vaccine does not stop infection,01:12:18.800,2.879
so you're a used car salesman and you're,01:12:21.679,2.721
selling the vaccine,01:12:24.400,1.68
and the features you thought of vaccine,01:12:26.080,1.92
would have i mean i have a similar kind,01:12:28.000,1.44
of sense when the vaccine came out,01:12:29.440,2.16
vaccine would,01:12:31.600,1.92
reduce,01:12:33.520,1.76
if you somehow were able to get it you,01:12:35.280,2.24
would reduce rate of death and all those,01:12:37.520,1.679
kinds of things but it would also reduce,01:12:39.199,2.641
the chance of you,01:12:41.840,1.359
getting it and if you do get it the,01:12:43.199,2.561
chance that you transmitting it to,01:12:45.760,1.6
somebody else,01:12:47.360,1.44
and it turns out that those latter two,01:12:48.800,2.96
things are not as uh definitive or in,01:12:51.760,3.04
fact they're i mean i don't know to,01:12:54.800,1.6
which agree they're not i mean i think,01:12:56.400,1.6
it's it's a little complicated because i,01:12:58.000,1.36
think the first two or three months,01:12:59.360,2.08
after you're fully vaccinated after the,01:13:01.440,1.279
second dose you have,01:13:02.719,3.601
60 70 percent efficacy peak against,01:13:06.320,2.56
infection yeah so uh that which is,01:13:08.880,2.48
pretty good i mean right but by,01:13:11.360,2.24
six seven eight months that drops to 20,01:13:13.600,2.4
percent some places some studies like,01:13:16.000,2.48
there's a study out of sweden suggested,01:13:18.480,1.44
it might even drop to zero but and then,01:13:19.920,2.08
you're also infectious for some period,01:13:22.000,1.84
of time if you do get it even though,01:13:23.840,2.08
you're vaccinated correct although there,01:13:25.920,1.84
seems to be,01:13:27.760,1.2
lucy data that the period of time your,01:13:28.960,1.84
infectious is short it's shorter but the,01:13:30.800,2.16
the infectivity per day is about as high,01:13:32.960,3.44
so you still it's the point is that that,01:13:36.400,2.319
the vaccine might reduce some risk of,01:13:38.719,2.241
infecting others but it's not a,01:13:40.960,1.44
categorical difference,01:13:42.400,2.319
so uh a unvaccine it's not safe to be in,01:13:44.719,4.241
the presence of just vaccinated people,01:13:48.960,2.16
you can still get infected,01:13:51.120,2.64
right so i mean there's a million things,01:13:53.760,2.32
i want to ask here but,01:13:56.080,2.32
is there in some sense because the,01:13:58.400,1.839
vaccine,01:14:00.239,1.361
um,01:14:01.600,1.28
really helps on the worst,01:14:02.880,2.56
part of this pandemic which is killing,01:14:05.440,2.16
people yes,01:14:07.600,1.92
uh doesn't that mean,01:14:09.520,1.84
uh where does the vaccine hesitancy come,01:14:11.360,3.12
from,01:14:14.480,1.04
in terms of it seems like obviously a,01:14:15.520,2.719
vaccine is a powerful solution to let us,01:14:18.239,2.96
open this thing up yeah so i wrote a,01:14:21.199,2.161
wall street journal op-ed with sinatra,01:14:23.360,1.6
gupta in december of last year yes a,01:14:24.960,2.719
very night with a very naive title which,01:14:27.679,2.161
says we can end the lockdowns in a month,01:14:29.840,2.399
and the idea is very simple,01:14:32.239,1.601
vaccinate,01:14:33.840,1.28
all,01:14:35.120,1.44
vulnerable people,01:14:36.560,2.56
and then,01:14:39.120,0.96
open up open up right uh and the idea,01:14:40.080,2.32
was that uh the the lockdown harms this,01:14:42.400,2.24
is related this is directly related to,01:14:44.640,1.28
the great barrington declaration the,01:14:45.920,1.04
great antarctic clergy said the lockdown,01:14:46.960,2.08
harms are devastating,01:14:49.040,2.0
to the population at large,01:14:51.040,2.159
there's this,01:14:53.199,1.361
considerable segment of people that are,01:14:54.560,1.52
vulnerable,01:14:56.080,1.119
protect them well with the vaccine we,01:14:57.199,1.841
have a perfect tool to protect the,01:14:59.040,1.6
vulnerable which is i still believe i,01:15:00.640,2.0
mean is true right you vaccinate the,01:15:02.640,2.88
vulnerable the older population and as,01:15:05.520,2.08
you said there's a tenfold decrease in,01:15:07.600,1.68
the mortality risk,01:15:09.280,1.6
um from getting infected,01:15:10.880,2.16
which is i mean amazing so that was the,01:15:13.040,2.32
strategy we got we outlined what,01:15:15.360,2.0
happened is that the vaccine debate got,01:15:17.360,2.319
transformed so first there's so you're,01:15:19.679,2.081
asking about vaccine hesitance i think,01:15:21.760,1.2
there's there's first there's like,01:15:22.960,1.12
there's there's the inherent,01:15:24.080,2.079
limitations of how to measure vaccine,01:15:26.159,2.401
safety right so we talked about a little,01:15:28.560,1.76
bit about the trial but also after the,01:15:30.320,2.16
trial there's a there's a there's a,01:15:32.480,1.679
mechanism and this is the work i've been,01:15:34.159,2.08
involved with before covet on,01:15:36.239,2.641
on tracking and and identifying and,01:15:38.880,2.799
checking whether the vaccines actually,01:15:41.679,1.761
are safe and the central challenge is,01:15:43.440,1.759
one of causality,01:15:45.199,1.841
so you no longer have the randomized,01:15:47.040,1.44
trial,01:15:48.480,1.92
but but you want to know is the vaccine,01:15:50.400,2.24
when is deployed at scale,01:15:52.640,2.0
causing,01:15:54.640,1.039
adverse events,01:15:55.679,2.081
well you can't just look at people who,01:15:57.760,1.52
are vaccinated and see what adverse,01:15:59.280,1.439
events happen,01:16:00.719,1.201
because you don't know what would have,01:16:01.920,1.12
happened if the person had not been,01:16:03.040,2.08
vaccinated,01:16:05.120,1.76
so you have to have some control group,01:16:06.880,2.88
now what happened is there's several,01:16:09.760,1.68
systems to do to check this in that the,01:16:11.440,2.239
cdc uses one one very very very commonly,01:16:13.679,2.881
known one now is called vares the,01:16:16.560,1.599
vaccine adverse event reporting system,01:16:18.159,2.321
there anyone who has an adverse event,01:16:20.480,2.16
that either either a regular person or a,01:16:22.640,1.84
doctor can just go report look i have,01:16:24.480,2.56
the vaccine and two days later i had a,01:16:27.040,1.44
headache or whatever it is,01:16:28.480,2.16
the person died,01:16:30.640,1.28
a day after the vaccine right um now you,01:16:31.920,2.72
vaccinate that the vaccine was rolled,01:16:34.640,1.519
out to older people first,01:16:36.159,2.481
and older people die sometimes with or,01:16:38.640,2.559
without the vaccine so,01:16:41.199,1.841
sometimes you'll see someone's,01:16:43.040,1.04
vaccinated and a few days later they die,01:16:44.080,2.48
did the vaccine cause it or something,01:16:46.560,1.52
else cause it's really difficult to tell,01:16:48.080,2.079
in order to tell you need a control,01:16:50.159,1.441
group,01:16:51.600,1.84
for that um,01:16:53.440,1.759
there are other systems the fda and cdc,01:16:55.199,2.161
have,01:16:57.360,0.799
uh like there's one called vsd vaccine,01:16:58.159,2.401
safety data link there's another system,01:17:00.560,2.32
called best,01:17:02.880,1.2
uh,01:17:04.080,0.8
i forget the app with the acronym is to,01:17:04.880,2.56
essentially to track uh cohorts of,01:17:07.440,2.719
people,01:17:10.159,1.201
vaccinated versus unvaccinated was as,01:17:11.360,2.879
careful of matching as you can do it's,01:17:14.239,1.44
not randomized but and then c,01:17:15.679,2.641
if you have,01:17:18.320,1.76
safety signals that pop up in the,01:17:20.080,2.639
vaccinated relative to the control group,01:17:22.719,1.921
unvaccinated,01:17:24.640,1.68
um and so that's for instance how the,01:17:26.320,2.8
the the myocarditis risk was picked up,01:17:29.120,2.72
in young young especially young men,01:17:31.840,2.24
it's also how the,01:17:34.080,1.92
higher risk of blood clots in middle age,01:17:36.000,2.96
and older women in with the jnj vaccine,01:17:38.960,2.96
is picked,01:17:41.920,0.92
up there what you have is are situations,01:17:42.840,3.48
where the baseline risk of these,01:17:46.320,2.24
outcomes are so low that if you see them,01:17:48.560,2.88
in the con in the vaccinated arm at all,01:17:51.440,2.56
then it's not hard to understand that,01:17:54.000,1.44
the vaccine did this right,01:17:55.440,1.92
young men should not be having,01:17:57.360,1.52
myocarditis,01:17:58.880,1.6
middle-aged women should not be having,01:18:00.480,1.679
huge blood clots in the brain right um,01:18:02.159,2.08
so when you see that you can say it's,01:18:04.239,1.281
linked now the rates are low so young,01:18:05.520,2.24
men maybe one in five thousand one in,01:18:07.760,2.0
ten thousand of the vaccine of my,01:18:09.760,2.0
vaccine-related myocarditis pericarditis,01:18:11.760,2.56
um young women of middle-aged women i,01:18:14.320,2.879
don't know i don't i'm not sure what the,01:18:17.199,1.681
right number might be but like i'd say,01:18:18.880,1.359
it's like in the you know one in,01:18:20.239,2.0
hundreds of thousands something like,01:18:22.239,1.761
that,01:18:24.000,2.32
so these are rare outcomes but they're,01:18:26.320,1.839
they're they are vaccinating linked,01:18:28.159,1.52
outcomes,01:18:29.679,1.201
how do you deal with that as a messaging,01:18:30.880,2.56
thing i think you just tell people you,01:18:33.440,1.92
tell people here are the risks you,01:18:35.360,1.359
transparently tell them and just you're,01:18:36.719,1.52
not you're not they're so they're not,01:18:38.239,0.96
getting into something that they don't,01:18:39.199,1.121
know,01:18:40.320,0.72
yeah and um don't treat people like,01:18:41.040,3.28
their children and need to be told lies,01:18:44.320,2.879
because they won't understand the full,01:18:47.199,1.681
complexity of the truth uh people i,01:18:48.880,2.64
think are pretty good at um or actually,01:18:51.520,4.56
you know,01:18:56.080,0.96
people with time are good at,01:18:57.040,1.52
understanding data but better than,01:18:58.560,2.08
anything they're uh,01:19:00.640,2.32
they're better at they're extremely good,01:19:02.960,2.4
at detecting arrogance and and,01:19:05.360,3.52
yeah give them either one of those i,01:19:08.880,1.839
mean i'll give you one that's where i,01:19:10.719,1.44
think it's greatly undermined vaccine,01:19:12.159,1.761
has,01:19:13.920,1.04
greatly undermined the demand for the,01:19:14.960,1.199
vaccine is this weird denial that if you,01:19:16.159,3.281
recover from kovid you have extremely,01:19:19.440,2.16
good,01:19:21.600,1.52
immunity both against infection and,01:19:23.120,2.079
actually exchange,01:19:25.199,1.761
and that denial,01:19:26.960,2.239
leads to people distrusting the message,01:19:29.199,2.561
given by like the cdc director for,01:19:31.760,1.68
instance favored the vaccine,01:19:33.440,2.16
right why would you deny a thing that's,01:19:35.600,2.4
such an obvious fact it's like you can,01:19:38.000,1.84
look at the data and it just i mean it,01:19:39.840,2.56
just just pops out at you that people,01:19:42.400,1.6
that are covered recovered,01:19:44.000,1.679
are not getting infected again at very,01:19:45.679,1.441
high rates,01:19:47.120,1.52
much lower rates after these kinds of,01:19:48.640,2.4
conversations um,01:19:51.040,1.84
i'm sure after this com very,01:19:52.880,1.52
conversation i often get uh a number of,01:19:54.400,3.12
messages from joe joe rogan and from sam,01:19:57.520,2.48
harris who to me are people i admire i,01:20:00.000,3.6
think are really intelligent thoughtful,01:20:03.600,1.76
human beings they also have a platform,01:20:05.360,2.96
and i i i believe at least in my mind,01:20:08.320,2.72
about this coveted,01:20:11.040,1.92
set of topics they represent,01:20:12.960,2.8
a group of people,01:20:15.760,3.04
each group has,01:20:19.760,1.919
smart,01:20:21.679,1.601
thoughtful,01:20:23.280,2.32
well-intentioned human beings and i,01:20:25.600,2.48
don't know who is right,01:20:28.080,2.079
but i i do know that they're kind of,01:20:30.159,3.441
tribal a little bit,01:20:33.600,2.0
uh those groups and so,01:20:35.600,3.84
the question i want to ask is like what,01:20:39.520,1.6
do you think about these,01:20:41.120,2.32
uh two,01:20:43.440,1.4
groups and this kind of tension over the,01:20:44.840,3.0
vaccine,01:20:47.840,1.92
that sometimes it just keeps finding,01:20:49.760,1.919
different topics,01:20:51.679,2.321
on which to focus on like whether kids,01:20:54.000,2.08
should get vaccinated or not whether,01:20:56.080,1.92
there should be vaccine mandates or not,01:20:58.000,2.239
which seem to be often very kind of,01:21:00.239,2.0
specific policy kinds of questions right,01:21:02.239,2.641
it's the bigger picture i think it's a,01:21:04.880,2.08
symptom of the distrust that people have,01:21:06.960,1.92
in public health,01:21:08.880,1.44
i think this kind of schism over the the,01:21:10.320,2.879
vaccine does not happen in places where,01:21:13.199,2.081
the public health authorities have been,01:21:15.280,1.439
much more trustworthy,01:21:16.719,1.841
right so you don't see this vaccine,01:21:18.560,1.44
hasn't seen sweden for instance,01:21:20.000,2.48
um,01:21:22.480,1.199
what's happened in the united states is,01:21:23.679,1.921
the vaccine has become,01:21:25.600,3.28
first because of politics but then also,01:21:29.040,1.92
because of the scientific arrogance this,01:21:30.960,2.16
sort of touchstone issue and people line,01:21:33.120,2.559
up on you on both sides of it and the,01:21:35.679,1.761
different language you're hearing,01:21:37.440,2.0
is structured around that so before the,01:21:39.440,2.08
election for instance i did uh,01:21:41.520,2.159
uh i was a i did a testimony in the,01:21:43.679,2.321
house on on measurement of vaccine,01:21:46.000,2.239
safety,01:21:48.239,1.44
and i i was i was invited by the,01:21:49.679,2.161
republicans there were i think uh four,01:21:51.840,1.839
other experts invited by the democrats,01:21:53.679,1.441
or three other experts invited by,01:21:55.120,1.039
democrats,01:21:56.159,1.281
each of whom had a lot of experience in,01:21:57.440,1.759
measuring vaccine safety i was really,01:21:59.199,2.161
surprised to hear them each,01:22:01.360,2.72
doubt whether the fda would do a,01:22:04.080,1.92
reasonable job in assessing vaccine,01:22:06.000,1.6
safety,01:22:07.600,1.039
including by people who have long,01:22:08.639,2.0
records of working with the fda,01:22:10.639,2.161
i mean these are,01:22:12.800,1.68
professionals,01:22:14.480,1.28
great scientists whose main you know,01:22:15.760,2.64
sort of goal in life is to make sure,01:22:18.400,1.44
that safe vaccine that that unsafe,01:22:19.840,2.08
vaccines don't get released into the,01:22:21.920,1.44
world and if they argue they get pulled,01:22:23.360,2.879
and they're casting down on the vaccine,01:22:26.239,2.161
the ability to track vaccine safety,01:22:28.400,2.0
before the election,01:22:30.400,2.88
and then after the election,01:22:33.280,2.8
the the rhetoric switched on a dime,01:22:36.080,2.96
right all of a sudden it's republicans,01:22:39.040,1.76
that are cast as if they're vaccine,01:22:40.800,1.76
hesitant,01:22:42.560,1.2
that kind of political shift,01:22:43.760,2.0
the public notices,01:22:45.760,1.919
if if all it takes is an election to,01:22:47.679,2.241
change how people talk about the safety,01:22:49.920,1.759
of the vaccine well we're not talking,01:22:51.679,1.841
science anymore many people think right,01:22:53.520,2.08
i think that creates created its,01:22:55.600,1.599
hesitancy,01:22:57.199,1.921
the other thing i think the um,01:22:59.120,2.4
the,01:23:01.520,0.719
the hesitancy,01:23:02.239,1.92
some politicians viewed it as a,01:23:04.159,2.48
political,01:23:06.639,1.121
as sort of like a political opportunity,01:23:07.760,2.8
to sort of demonize people who were,01:23:10.560,2.0
hesitant,01:23:12.560,1.599
and that itself fueled hesitancy right,01:23:14.159,2.48
like the if you're if you're telling me,01:23:16.639,1.361
i'm a rube that just doesn't want the,01:23:18.000,1.36
vaccine because i want everyone to die,01:23:19.360,1.359
well i'm gonna i'm gonna react really,01:23:20.719,1.92
negatively,01:23:22.639,2.401
and if you're talking down to me,01:23:25.040,2.48
about,01:23:27.520,1.6
my legitimate,01:23:29.120,1.599
you know sort of,01:23:30.719,1.44
concerns about whether this vaccine's,01:23:32.159,1.52
safe to i mean i've like heard from,01:23:33.679,2.401
women who are thinking about getting,01:23:36.080,1.119
pregnant should i take the vaccine i,01:23:37.199,1.52
don't know i mean there are all kinds of,01:23:38.719,1.44
questions,01:23:40.159,0.961
legitimate questions that i think,01:23:41.120,3.119
should have good data to answer that we,01:23:44.239,1.761
don't necessarily have good data to,01:23:46.000,1.12
answer so what do you do in the face of,01:23:47.120,2.0
that,01:23:49.120,0.96
well,01:23:50.080,0.8
one reaction is to pretend like we we,01:23:50.880,2.64
know for a fact that it's safe,01:23:53.520,1.84
when we don't have the data to know for,01:23:55.360,2.0
fact in that particular group with that,01:23:57.360,1.279
particular set of clinical circumstances,01:23:58.639,1.681
you know,01:24:00.320,1.44
and that i think breeds hesitancy people,01:24:01.760,2.16
can detect that um whereas if,01:24:03.920,2.799
you just tell people you know i don't,01:24:06.719,1.281
know,01:24:08.000,1.199
yeah you deal with humility yeah you're,01:24:09.199,1.761
gonna you're you'll end up with a better,01:24:10.960,1.679
result,01:24:12.639,1.841
let me ask you about i've recently had a,01:24:14.480,2.0
conversation with the pfizer ceo,01:24:16.480,3.04
this is,01:24:19.520,2.4
part therapy session part advice because,01:24:22.000,2.719
i again i really want,01:24:24.719,3.52
us to get through this together and it,01:24:28.239,1.761
feels like the division is a thing that,01:24:30.000,1.84
uh prevents us from getting through this,01:24:31.840,1.839
together,01:24:33.679,1.52
and uh once again just like with francis,01:24:35.199,2.881
collins a lot of people,01:24:38.080,2.0
wrote to me,01:24:40.080,2.0
words of support,01:24:42.080,1.52
and a lot of people wrote to me words of,01:24:43.600,2.639
criticism,01:24:46.239,2.561
i'm trying to understand,01:24:48.800,2.08
the nature of the criticism,01:24:50.880,2.16
so some of the criticism had to do with,01:24:53.040,3.199
against the vaccine and those kinds of,01:24:56.239,1.841
things that i have a better,01:24:58.080,1.68
understanding of,01:24:59.760,2.32
but,01:25:02.080,0.72
some kind of deep distrust,01:25:02.800,2.56
of pfizer,01:25:05.360,2.0
so,01:25:07.360,1.04
um,01:25:08.400,0.88
actually looking at uh big pharma,01:25:09.280,2.56
broadly,01:25:11.840,1.839
i'm trying to,01:25:13.679,1.441
understand,01:25:15.120,1.36
am i so naive,01:25:16.480,3.04
that i just don't see it,01:25:19.520,2.8
because yes there's corrupt people and,01:25:22.320,2.399
they they're greedy they're flawed in,01:25:24.719,2.801
all walks of life,01:25:27.520,2.24
but uh companies,01:25:29.760,2.8
do,01:25:32.560,1.119
quite an incredible job of taking a good,01:25:33.679,2.881
idea at the scale and making some money,01:25:36.560,1.84
with that idea but they are the ones,01:25:38.400,1.839
that achieve scale on a good idea,01:25:40.239,3.041
i don't know,01:25:43.280,1.439
it's not obvious to me i don't see,01:25:44.719,3.121
where the manipulation is so the fear,01:25:47.840,2.56
that people have and,01:25:50.400,2.0
i talked to joe about this quite a bit i,01:25:52.400,2.799
i think this is a legitimate fear and,01:25:55.199,2.721
and a fury should often have that money,01:25:57.920,2.799
has influenced disproportional influence,01:26:00.719,2.401
especially in politics so the fear is,01:26:03.120,2.64
that,01:26:05.760,1.439
the policy,01:26:07.199,1.361
of uh the vaccine was connected to the,01:26:08.560,2.8
fact that,01:26:11.360,1.2
lots of money could be made,01:26:12.560,2.079
by manufacturing the vaccine,01:26:14.639,2.801
and i understand that,01:26:17.440,1.759
and i'm it's actually quite a heck of a,01:26:19.199,1.921
difficult task to alleviate that concern,01:26:21.120,3.28
like you really have to be a great man,01:26:24.400,1.759
or woman or a leader to convince people,01:26:26.159,2.961
that you're not full of that you're,01:26:29.120,1.519
not just playing a game on them,01:26:30.639,1.921
i don't know it's a it's a difficult,01:26:32.560,2.159
task but at the same time i i really,01:26:34.719,2.321
don't like the natural,01:26:37.040,2.8
distrust every billionaire distrust,01:26:39.840,2.56
everybody who's trying to make money,01:26:42.400,1.68
because it feels like under a,01:26:44.080,1.52
capitalistic system at least,01:26:45.600,2.24
the the way to do a lot of good like to,01:26:47.840,3.12
do good at scale in the world,01:26:50.960,2.16
is by,01:26:53.120,1.2
being at least in part motivated by the,01:26:54.320,3.12
profit i mean i share your ambivalence,01:26:57.440,1.6
right so on the one hand you have a a,01:26:59.040,2.32
fantastic achievement the the the,01:27:01.360,3.04
manufacture the discovery of the vaccine,01:27:04.400,2.16
and then the manufacturing at scale,01:27:06.560,2.24
so that,01:27:08.800,1.359
you know billions of people can take the,01:27:10.159,1.761
vaccine in a relatively short time that,01:27:11.920,2.16
is a remarkable achievement that could,01:27:14.080,1.84
not have happened without companies like,01:27:15.920,2.4
pfizer,01:27:18.320,1.6
um on the other hand the there is this,01:27:19.920,2.4
sort of corrupting influence of that,01:27:22.320,1.68
money,01:27:24.000,1.199
uh uh just to give you one example uh,01:27:25.199,2.0
there's a there's an enormous,01:27:27.199,1.121
controversy over whether uh relatively,01:27:28.320,2.399
inexpensive repurposed drugs can be used,01:27:30.719,2.801
to treat the the the disease,01:27:33.520,3.119
um,01:27:36.639,1.681
none of no company like pfizer has any,01:27:38.320,2.48
interest whatsoever in evaluating it,01:27:40.800,2.08
even merck i think support was merck,01:27:42.880,2.56
that,01:27:45.440,1.12
had the patent on ivormectin,01:27:46.560,2.32
uh now expired has no interest at all in,01:27:48.880,2.88
checking to see if it works,01:27:51.760,2.64
not only do they not have interest,01:27:54.400,3.2
they have,01:27:57.600,1.599
a way of talking about people who might,01:27:59.199,2.96
have a little bit of interest,01:28:02.159,2.241
that's again um fringe,01:28:04.400,2.64
uh,01:28:07.040,0.96
full of arrogance yeah,01:28:08.000,2.239
and that that is what troubles me,01:28:10.239,2.561
is there not a it's back to the play of,01:28:12.800,2.24
science it's not they're not a bit of,01:28:15.040,1.599
curiosity one okay one the natural,01:28:16.639,2.721
curiosity of a human being that should,01:28:19.360,1.6
always be there and an open mind is and,01:28:20.960,2.48
second in the case of ivermectin and,01:28:23.440,2.4
other things like that you have to,01:28:25.840,2.0
acknowledge that there's a very large,01:28:27.840,2.16
number of people,01:28:30.000,1.44
who care about this topic and this is a,01:28:31.440,2.799
way to inspire them to also play in the,01:28:34.239,3.601
space of science to inspire them with,01:28:37.840,1.6
science you can't just like dismiss,01:28:39.440,2.239
everybody,01:28:41.679,1.121
that uh you can't just dismiss people,01:28:42.800,2.24
period yeah well i mean i think here,01:28:45.040,2.0
here take ivermectin right there's,01:28:47.040,1.44
actually a study,01:28:48.480,2.0
funded by the nih by tony fauci's nia id,01:28:50.480,3.759
and the nih,01:28:54.239,1.281
um called active six,01:28:55.520,2.639
that's,01:28:58.159,0.801
a randomized trial of ivermectin,01:28:58.960,3.679
it's due to be completed in march 2023,01:29:02.639,4.481
so normally when you have uh private,01:29:07.120,3.36
actors like these big,01:29:10.480,1.759
drug companies that have no interest in,01:29:12.239,2.48
conducting some kind of scientific,01:29:14.719,1.44
experiment that would have some public,01:29:16.159,1.281
benefit,01:29:17.440,1.12
it's the job of the of the the,01:29:18.560,1.76
government and in this case the nih to,01:29:20.320,1.839
fund that kind of work the nih has been,01:29:22.159,3.721
incredibly slow,01:29:25.880,3.24
in its evaluations of these repurposed,01:29:29.120,2.48
drugs,01:29:31.600,1.2
and it's been left to lots of other,01:29:32.800,1.68
private private private activities,01:29:34.480,2.88
of uneven quality,01:29:37.360,2.08
and hence that's why you have these,01:29:39.440,1.44
these big fights,01:29:40.880,1.359
because the data are not solid you're,01:29:42.239,2.0
gonna have these big fights yeah but,01:29:44.239,2.241
also okay forget the the process of,01:29:46.480,2.64
science here the studies not enough,01:29:49.120,2.8
effort being put into the studies just,01:29:51.920,1.68
the way it's being communicated yeah no,01:29:53.600,1.92
like horse pace i mean come on the fda,01:29:55.520,2.639
put a tweet out telling people who are,01:29:58.159,2.721
like,01:30:00.880,0.799
they're taking iron mechanism because,01:30:01.679,1.281
they've heard good things about it and,01:30:02.960,1.199
they're sick and they're desperate and,01:30:04.159,2.161
just call it horse pace was just that,01:30:06.320,1.76
was that was terrible that was deeply,01:30:08.080,2.159
responsible my hope um is grounded in,01:30:10.239,3.041
the fact that young people see the the,01:30:13.280,2.0
 of this young phd students,01:30:15.280,2.399
graduate students young students in,01:30:17.679,1.681
college they see,01:30:19.360,2.08
the the,01:30:21.440,2.719
less than stellar way that our,01:30:24.159,2.161
scientific leaders and our political,01:30:26.320,1.919
leaders are behaving and then the new,01:30:28.239,1.681
generation will not repeat the mistakes,01:30:29.920,2.239
of the past that is my hope because uh,01:30:32.159,3.04
that that's the cool thing i see about,01:30:35.199,1.601
young people is they they,01:30:36.800,1.839
they're good at detecting and,01:30:38.639,1.681
they they don't want to be part of that,01:30:40.320,2.48
um that's my hope um in the space of,01:30:42.800,2.64
science,01:30:45.440,1.199
let me return to this idea of the great,01:30:46.639,2.241
barrington declaration return to the,01:30:48.880,2.48
beginning,01:30:51.360,1.279
so um what are the basics can you,01:30:52.639,2.241
describe what the great barrington,01:30:54.880,1.52
declaration is what are some of the,01:30:56.400,1.36
ideas in it you mentioned focused,01:30:57.760,2.16
protection,01:30:59.920,1.44
uh what are your concerns about,01:31:01.360,2.0
lockdowns just paint the picture of this,01:31:03.360,2.879
early proposal sure so uh the great,01:31:06.239,2.161
painting declaration first why is it,01:31:08.400,1.36
called great barrington declaration it,01:31:09.760,1.68
sounds it's such a great name,01:31:11.440,2.16
you,01:31:13.600,0.88
i mean it just it's such an epic name,01:31:14.480,2.239
but the the reason why it's called that,01:31:16.719,1.841
is way less than epic it's it was it was,01:31:18.560,2.4
because it the the conference um which,01:31:20.960,3.04
is organized by martin kuldorf who's a,01:31:24.000,1.76
was a professor at harvard university uh,01:31:25.760,1.919
by a statistician he actually,01:31:27.679,2.48
designed,01:31:30.159,1.201
the the safety system the statistical,01:31:31.360,2.24
system that the,01:31:33.600,1.28
fda uses,01:31:34.880,1.359
for,01:31:36.239,0.801
tracking vaccine safety,01:31:37.040,1.92
he,01:31:38.960,0.719
and i had met previously just the summer,01:31:39.679,2.641
before that summer,01:31:42.320,2.319
and he invited me to come to this small,01:31:44.639,2.401
conference where he was inviting me and,01:31:47.040,1.679
sinatra gupta who was a professor of,01:31:48.719,2.801
theoretical epidemiology at harvard,01:31:51.520,2.159
at oxford university,01:31:53.679,2.48
and i mean i jumped at the chance,01:31:56.159,2.321
uh because i knew that martin and,01:31:58.480,1.92
sinatra were both smarter than me and uh,01:32:00.400,2.16
it would be fun to like talk about what,01:32:02.560,2.0
uh what the right strategy would be,01:32:04.560,2.56
on the drive in i didn't know what the,01:32:07.120,2.16
name of the town was and i asked as they,01:32:09.280,2.959
said was great barrington i had in the,01:32:12.239,1.681
back of my head,01:32:13.920,1.36
um martin and i arrived a little early,01:32:15.280,2.16
and we were writing an op-ed about some,01:32:17.440,2.239
of the ideas i hope we get to talk about,01:32:19.679,1.281
very soon um about focus protection and,01:32:20.960,3.04
the right strategy and uh when sinetra,01:32:24.000,2.719
arrived we realized we actually come,01:32:26.719,2.161
basically to the same place about the,01:32:28.880,1.52
right,01:32:30.400,0.88
way to deal with the epidemic,01:32:31.280,2.48
um and i i thought well why don't we put,01:32:33.760,2.479
issue why don't we write something like,01:32:36.239,1.761
the port hearing statement that was what,01:32:38.000,1.679
i had that in the back of my head yes,01:32:39.679,1.681
and i'm like well what's the name of,01:32:41.360,1.52
this town again it was great barrington,01:32:42.880,1.759
yeah so it's not barrington,01:32:44.639,2.08
it's great bear it's which is fantastic,01:32:46.719,2.241
right,01:32:48.960,1.04
it's so over the top that it's perfect,01:32:50.000,2.719
it's it's,01:32:52.719,1.041
literally like the big bang,01:32:53.760,1.919
there's something about these,01:32:55.679,1.04
over-the-top fun titles that just really,01:32:56.719,2.321
deliver them,01:32:59.040,1.44
so that's why that's my my main,01:33:00.480,1.28
contribution was the word is the title,01:33:01.760,1.84
the name great barrington decor um but,01:33:03.600,2.32
yeah so it was it was kind of uh so the,01:33:05.920,1.84
and the the idea is actually,01:33:07.760,2.32
while the title is great um and i think,01:33:10.080,2.159
that it was written in a very stylish,01:33:12.239,1.361
way,01:33:13.600,0.8
um it's you know like it's a go it's,01:33:14.400,1.839
less than a page you can go look online,01:33:16.239,1.92
and read it it's written written for,01:33:18.159,2.641
not for scientists but for the general,01:33:20.800,1.839
public so people can understand the,01:33:22.639,1.52
ideas really simply,01:33:24.159,2.641
but it is not actually a radical set of,01:33:26.800,2.24
ideas it actually represents the old,01:33:29.040,1.92
pandemic plans,01:33:30.960,1.759
that we've used for century,01:33:32.719,2.401
dealing with other similar pandemics,01:33:35.120,3.119
um and and there's it's twofold uh first,01:33:38.239,3.201
let me talk about the science it rests,01:33:41.440,1.68
on and then i'll talk about the plan,01:33:43.120,1.76
the science actually some of what we,01:33:44.880,1.279
already talked about uh there's this,01:33:46.159,2.0
massive age gradient in the risk of,01:33:48.159,2.721
coven infection older people face much,01:33:50.880,2.0
higher risk than younger people,01:33:52.880,2.72
the second bit of science is all that's,01:33:55.600,1.92
not controversial right that even if you,01:33:57.520,1.6
think the ifr is 0.7 or or or 0.2 no,01:33:59.120,2.88
matter what everyone thinks everyone,01:34:02.000,1.679
agrees on this age gradient,01:34:03.679,2.881
the second bit of science is also not,01:34:06.560,1.52
controversial,01:34:08.080,2.159
the lockdown focused policies that we,01:34:10.239,2.081
followed,01:34:12.320,1.04
have absolutely devastating consequences,01:34:13.360,2.96
on the health of the population,01:34:16.320,3.52
let me just give you some examples uh,01:34:19.840,2.16
and this is this was known in october of,01:34:22.000,1.52
2020 we wrote it right so um the un was,01:34:23.520,3.04
sounding alarms that there would be,01:34:26.560,3.04
tens of millions of people who would,01:34:29.600,2.639
starve as a consequence of the economic,01:34:32.239,2.4
dislocation caused by the lockdowns,01:34:34.639,2.641
and that's come to pass,01:34:37.280,1.439
hundreds of thousands of children in,01:34:38.719,2.081
places like south asia dead from,01:34:40.800,1.76
starvation,01:34:42.560,2.639
as a consequence of lockdowns,01:34:45.199,3.121
um,01:34:48.320,0.879
the the the the uh uh,01:34:49.199,2.801
priorities like,01:34:52.000,2.0
the treatment of patients with,01:34:54.000,1.119
tuberculosis,01:34:55.119,1.52
in poor countries stopped,01:34:56.639,2.321
because of lockdowns,01:34:58.960,2.08
uh,01:35:01.040,0.88
childhood vaccinations of,01:35:01.920,2.0
measles rubella,01:35:03.920,1.92
dpt diphtheria so on pertussis tetanus,01:35:05.840,3.44
all those standard vaccination campaigns,01:35:09.280,2.72
stopped,01:35:12.000,1.199
tens of millions of children skipping,01:35:13.199,2.161
these doses,01:35:15.360,1.44
for diseases that are actually deadly,01:35:16.800,2.0
for them,01:35:18.800,1.6
is there just a on a small tangent,01:35:20.400,3.04
is it well understood to you what are,01:35:23.440,2.48
the mechanisms that stop all those,01:35:25.920,1.759
things because of lockdowns is it some,01:35:27.679,2.0
aspect of supply chain is it just,01:35:29.679,2.081
literally because,01:35:31.760,1.359
hospital doors are closed,01:35:33.119,1.921
is it because there's a disincentive to,01:35:35.040,2.48
go outside by people even when they,01:35:37.520,2.08
deeply need help it's all of the above,01:35:39.600,2.639
uh but a lot of those efforts especially,01:35:42.239,2.081
especially those like vaccination,01:35:44.320,1.12
efforts are funded and run by what,01:35:45.440,3.279
western efforts like gavi is a,01:35:48.719,2.561
i think it's a gates funded thing,01:35:51.280,1.28
actually that produce provides vaccines,01:35:52.560,2.559
for you know millions of kids worldwide,01:35:55.119,2.961
and those efforts were scaled back,01:35:58.080,3.039
malaria prevention efforts so in the,01:36:01.119,2.321
developing world it was a devastating,01:36:03.440,2.56
effect these lockdowns um there was also,01:36:06.000,2.48
direct effects like in india the,01:36:08.480,2.159
uh the lockdowns when they first,01:36:10.639,1.761
instituted there was an order that 10,01:36:12.400,2.56
million migrant workers,01:36:14.960,2.239
who live in big cities and they live,01:36:17.199,2.0
hand-to-mouth they buy you know coconuts,01:36:19.199,2.721
they sell the coconuts with the money,01:36:21.920,1.68
they buy food for themselves and,01:36:23.600,1.36
coconuts for the next day to sell um,01:36:24.960,3.199
walk back to their villages or get or,01:36:28.159,2.08
get go back to their villages then,01:36:30.239,2.321
overnight so 10 million people walking,01:36:32.560,2.4
back to their villages or taking a train,01:36:34.960,1.6
back a thousand died on route,01:36:36.560,2.4
overcrowded trains dying essentially on,01:36:38.960,2.239
the side of the road i mean it was it,01:36:41.199,1.281
was absolutely inhumane policy,01:36:42.480,3.28
uh and uh the lockdowns there,01:36:45.760,3.52
what what it's it's actually it's kind,01:36:49.280,2.32
of like what's happened to the west as,01:36:51.600,1.2
well but it was so severe uh there was a,01:36:52.800,2.96
zero prevalence study done in mumbai by,01:36:55.760,2.8
a friend of mine at the university of,01:36:58.560,1.04
chicago what he found was that in the,01:36:59.600,2.0
slums of mumbai,01:37:01.600,1.84
there were 70 surah prevalence in july,01:37:03.440,2.32
or august of seven of sept of 2020,01:37:05.760,2.8
whereas in the rest of mumbai is 20,01:37:08.560,2.72
yeah right so it was incredibly unequal,01:37:11.280,2.24
the the lockdowns protected the the,01:37:13.520,2.719
relatively well off and spread the,01:37:16.239,2.241
disease,01:37:18.480,1.04
among the poor,01:37:19.520,2.24
um so uh that's in the developing world,01:37:21.760,3.6
in the developed world the health,01:37:25.360,1.12
effects of lockdowns were,01:37:26.480,2.4
also quite bad,01:37:28.880,1.839
right so we talked already about,01:37:30.719,1.361
isolation and depression there was a,01:37:32.080,2.32
study done in july of 2020,01:37:34.400,3.12
that found that one in four young adults,01:37:37.520,3.679
seriously considered suicide,01:37:41.199,2.0
now suicide rates haven't like spiked up,01:37:43.199,3.681
so much but the depths of despair that,01:37:46.880,2.96
would lead somebody to seriously,01:37:49.840,2.08
consider suicide itself should be should,01:37:51.920,2.239
be a source of great concern for in,01:37:54.159,2.241
public health,01:37:56.400,1.279
yeah this is one of the troubling things,01:37:57.679,2.321
about measuring well-being is,01:38:00.000,3.04
we're okay at measuring death and,01:38:03.040,1.84
suicide,01:38:04.880,1.2
we're not so good at measuring suffering,01:38:06.080,2.72
it's like people talk about,01:38:08.800,2.64
um maybe even,01:38:11.440,1.84
harder more in the under stalin or the,01:38:13.280,3.68
concentration camps with hitler we talk,01:38:16.960,2.8
about deaths,01:38:19.760,1.439
but we don't talk about,01:38:21.199,1.681
the suffering over periods of years,01:38:22.880,3.2
by people living in fear by people,01:38:26.080,2.079
starving,01:38:28.159,1.201
psychological trauma that lasts a,01:38:29.360,2.319
lifetime all of those things,01:38:31.679,2.161
i mean and just to get back to that that,01:38:33.840,1.76
point we close schools especially in,01:38:35.600,2.32
blue states we close schools,01:38:37.920,2.08
now richer parents could send their kids,01:38:40.000,2.159
to private schools many of which stayed,01:38:42.159,1.52
open even in the blue states they could,01:38:43.679,1.52
get pods they could get tutors but,01:38:45.199,2.081
that's not true for for poorer and,01:38:47.280,2.08
middle class parents,01:38:49.360,2.319
and as a result what we did is we took,01:38:51.679,2.48
away life opportunities for kids we we,01:38:54.159,1.921
tried to teach,01:38:56.080,1.52
five-year-olds to read via zoom in,01:38:57.600,1.84
kindergarten,01:38:59.440,1.759
right uh,01:39:01.199,1.52
and uh the consequence actually you,01:39:02.719,2.0
think okay we can just make it up but,01:39:04.719,1.52
it's really difficult to make that up,01:39:06.239,2.721
there's a literature in health economics,01:39:08.960,2.719
that shows that even uh,01:39:11.679,2.241
you know,01:39:13.920,0.88
relatively small disruptions in,01:39:14.800,2.64
schooling can have lifelong consequences,01:39:17.440,2.719
negative consequences for kids,01:39:20.159,2.0
right so they end up growing up poorer,01:39:22.159,3.201
they they lead shorter lives and less,01:39:25.360,2.08
healthy lives,01:39:27.440,1.279
as a consequence that's and that's what,01:39:28.719,1.681
the literature now shows is likely to,01:39:30.400,1.839
happen with the interruptions of,01:39:32.239,2.241
schooling that we had in the united,01:39:34.480,1.6
states many european countries actually,01:39:36.080,1.68
managed to avoid this there were in the,01:39:37.760,1.84
early days the epidemic great,01:39:39.600,1.68
indications that children first were not,01:39:41.280,2.24
very severe severely at risk from covet,01:39:43.520,2.08
itself,01:39:45.600,0.96
nor are they super spreaders,01:39:46.560,2.48
schools were not the source of community,01:39:49.040,2.079
spread communities spread spread,01:39:51.119,2.641
the disease to schools not the other way,01:39:53.760,1.6
around,01:39:55.360,1.92
um and if we can talk about the,01:39:57.280,1.04
scientific basis of that if you'd like,01:39:58.320,1.52
but that was pretty well known even in,01:39:59.840,2.24
october,01:40:02.080,1.039
um it that we we closed hospitals in,01:40:03.119,2.56
order to keep them,01:40:05.679,1.761
like available to covet patients but as,01:40:07.440,2.4
a result,01:40:09.840,1.12
women skipped breast cancer screening,01:40:10.960,3.12
as a result they have are showing up,01:40:14.080,1.599
with,01:40:15.679,0.721
late stage breast cancer that should,01:40:16.400,1.2
have been picked up last year,01:40:17.600,1.92
men and women skipped colon cancer,01:40:19.520,1.679
screening again with later stage disease,01:40:21.199,2.321
that should have been picked up last,01:40:23.520,1.04
year with earlier stage for patients,01:40:24.560,2.079
with diabetes,01:40:26.639,2.241
it's very important to have regular,01:40:28.880,1.52
screening for blood sugar levels,01:40:30.400,2.719
and and sort of counseling for lifestyle,01:40:33.119,2.641
improvement and we skipped that,01:40:35.760,2.32
people stayed home with heart attacks,01:40:38.080,1.52
and died at home with heart attacks,01:40:39.600,3.68
so you had this like sort of wide range,01:40:43.280,2.32
of medical,01:40:45.600,1.68
and psychological harms,01:40:47.280,2.32
that were being utterly ignored,01:40:49.600,2.16
as a result of the lockdowns,01:40:51.760,2.08
plus there's the economic pain,01:40:53.840,3.359
so like you said the,01:40:57.199,2.161
whatever is a good term for the,01:40:59.360,1.319
non-laptop class,01:41:00.679,2.52
people would lose their jobs yes there,01:41:03.199,2.241
might be in the in the western world,01:41:05.440,1.679
support for them,01:41:07.119,1.6
financially but the the big loss there,01:41:08.719,2.641
that is perhaps correlated with the,01:41:11.360,2.319
depression and suicide is uh,01:41:13.679,2.881
loss of meaning loss of hope for the,01:41:16.560,2.159
future a loss of kind of a sense of,01:41:18.719,3.041
stability all the pride you have and,01:41:21.760,2.479
being able to um,01:41:24.239,3.121
make,01:41:27.520,1.44
money that allows you to pave your own,01:41:28.960,2.32
way in the world,01:41:31.280,1.359
and yes just having less money than,01:41:32.639,2.161
you're used to so your family your kids,01:41:34.800,2.08
are suffering all those kinds of things,01:41:36.880,1.359
and there's a there's again an economics,01:41:38.239,1.92
literature on this on deaths of despair,01:41:40.159,2.48
it was called 2009 there was the the,01:41:42.639,2.401
great recession it led to an enormous,01:41:45.040,2.4
uptick in overdose from drugs,01:41:47.440,2.88
uh suicidality depression,01:41:50.320,2.96
as a result of the job losses that,01:41:53.280,1.839
happened during the great recession,01:41:55.119,2.241
well that's happening again like an,01:41:57.360,2.0
enormous increase,01:41:59.360,1.68
in drug overdoses,01:42:01.040,2.88
that's not uh that's not a an accident,01:42:03.920,2.48
that's a lockdown harm right same same,01:42:06.400,1.92
thing with uh with the job losses the,01:42:08.320,2.16
job losses by the way are like it's so,01:42:10.480,1.759
interesting because the um the states,01:42:12.239,2.4
that stayed open have had,01:42:14.639,1.841
much much lower unemployment than the,01:42:16.480,2.08
states that stayed closed,01:42:18.560,1.679
uh the labor force participation rates,01:42:20.239,2.081
declined by three percent it's women,01:42:22.320,1.76
that separated because,01:42:24.080,2.079
they stayed home with their kids um,01:42:26.159,2.241
we've reversed a generation of women uh,01:42:28.400,3.52
when,01:42:31.920,1.759
proving women's participation in the,01:42:33.679,1.761
labor force,01:42:35.440,1.52
do you think,01:42:36.960,2.159
it has to do with institutions that,01:42:39.119,2.721
we mentioned that there is so much,01:42:41.840,1.44
priority given or so much power given to,01:42:43.280,2.64
maybe nih,01:42:45.920,2.319
versus um,01:42:48.239,1.681
other civilian leaders or do people just,01:42:49.920,2.88
not care about the economic pain the,01:42:52.800,1.68
leaders i mean uh because to me it was,01:42:54.480,3.44
obvious,01:42:57.920,1.279
i mean probably it's just studying,01:42:59.199,2.721
history,01:43:01.920,1.52
whenever i listen to people on twitter,01:43:03.440,2.96
on mainstream news or just anything,01:43:06.400,4.48
i realize that's the very kind of top,01:43:10.880,3.359
the the people that have a voice,01:43:14.239,2.96
represent a tiny selection of people and,01:43:17.199,2.401
so whenever there's hard times i always,01:43:19.600,2.8
kind of think about the the quiet,01:43:22.400,3.2
the voiceless,01:43:25.600,1.519
the quiet suffering of the tens of,01:43:27.119,2.321
millions of the hundreds of millions,01:43:29.440,2.719
um,01:43:32.159,1.52
do the political leaders not just give a,01:43:33.679,2.081
damn i mean i think it was actually a,01:43:35.760,2.0
very odd ethical thing at the beginning,01:43:37.760,2.32
of the pandemic where if you brought up,01:43:40.080,2.24
economic harms at all,01:43:42.320,1.839
you were seen as callous,01:43:44.159,3.121
right so i i i had a reporter calling me,01:43:47.280,2.56
up almost the very beginning of the,01:43:49.840,1.2
epidemic asking me about about the about,01:43:51.040,2.48
uh,01:43:53.520,0.8
uh,01:43:54.320,0.96
like a very particular phenomenon so,01:43:55.280,1.76
like uh he he was anticipating a rise in,01:43:57.040,2.88
child abuse because children were gonna,01:43:59.920,1.52
be staying at home child abuse is,01:44:01.440,1.279
generally picked up at school,01:44:02.719,2.161
and that actually happened like so like,01:44:04.880,1.359
the the child reported child abuse,01:44:06.239,1.761
dropped but actual child abuse increased,01:44:08.000,2.719
um,01:44:10.719,0.96
because normally you pick up the child,01:44:11.679,1.681
abuse at school and that you apparently,01:44:13.360,1.52
you have the intervention right so yeah,01:44:14.880,1.92
so i was talking about like well there's,01:44:16.800,1.28
gonna be some economic harms and they're,01:44:18.080,1.119
going to have health consequences but,01:44:19.199,0.96
the economic harms matter but the but,01:44:20.159,2.641
he's he he counseled me and i think he,01:44:22.800,2.64
was he had his bet my best interest at,01:44:25.440,1.679
heart like if if we were to put that in,01:44:27.119,1.6
the story i would be i'd essentially be,01:44:28.719,2.0
canceled because the what the what the,01:44:30.719,2.081
uh the the narrative that that arose in,01:44:32.800,2.64
march of 2020 is if you if you care,01:44:35.440,2.239
about money at all,01:44:37.679,1.921
you're evil and crass if you you must,01:44:39.600,2.0
only care about lives,01:44:41.600,2.16
the problem with that narrative is that,01:44:43.760,1.76
that money which we're talking about is,01:44:45.520,2.4
is actually lives of poor people,01:44:47.920,3.279
right when you throw 100 million people,01:44:51.199,2.721
around the world into into poverty,01:44:53.920,2.0
you're going to see enormous harm to,01:44:55.920,2.16
their health enormous increases in their,01:44:58.080,2.0
in their mortality it's not immoral to,01:45:00.080,2.24
think about that and and worry about,01:45:02.320,1.68
that,01:45:04.000,0.88
in the context of this pandemic response,01:45:04.880,2.319
our mind focused so much on kovid that,01:45:07.199,3.121
it forgot that there are so many other,01:45:10.320,1.76
public health priorities as well that,01:45:12.080,1.52
need our attention desperately and this,01:45:13.600,3.039
is the thing i,01:45:16.639,2.56
sensed about san francisco when i,01:45:19.199,2.161
visited i was thinking of moving there,01:45:21.360,1.6
for startup,01:45:22.960,1.52
this is the thing i'm really afraid of,01:45:24.480,2.0
especially if i have any,01:45:26.480,2.96
effect on the world through a startup is,01:45:29.440,2.32
losing touch in this kind of way,01:45:31.760,2.56
that uh you mentioned the laptop class,01:45:34.320,2.96
um,01:45:37.280,0.8
living in this world where you're only,01:45:38.080,1.599
concerned about this particular,01:45:39.679,2.48
of class of people and also,01:45:42.159,3.441
uh you know perhaps in early on in the,01:45:45.600,2.559
pandemic amongst the laptop class there,01:45:48.159,1.921
was a legitimate concern for health like,01:45:50.080,2.0
you're not sure,01:45:52.080,1.52
how deadly this virus is you don't,01:45:53.600,2.24
you're not sure who to listen to so,01:45:55.840,1.44
there's a real concern,01:45:57.280,1.52
and then at a certain point when the,01:45:58.800,1.68
data starts coming in you start becoming,01:46:00.480,2.88
more and more detached from the data you,01:46:03.360,1.759
don't start carrying less and less and,01:46:05.119,2.08
you start just,01:46:07.199,1.44
swimming in the space of narratives like,01:46:08.639,2.241
existing the space of narratives and you,01:46:10.880,1.6
have this narrative,01:46:12.480,1.36
in san francisco in the laptop class,01:46:13.840,3.04
that you just are very uh proud that you,01:46:16.880,3.279
know the truth you're the sole,01:46:20.159,1.52
possessors of the truth you congratulate,01:46:21.679,2.0
yourself on it and you don't care what,01:46:23.679,2.48
actually,01:46:26.159,1.121
gigantic detrimental effect it has on,01:46:27.280,1.839
society because,01:46:29.119,1.52
you're mostly,01:46:30.639,1.681
fine,01:46:32.320,1.6
that i'm so terrified of that,01:46:33.920,2.719
well i think the answer to that is just,01:46:36.639,2.0
to,01:46:38.639,0.961
you remember,01:46:39.600,0.88
yeah yeah,01:46:40.480,1.28
i don't think um you know remember where,01:46:41.760,1.52
you came from remember who who who,01:46:43.280,1.839
you're doing is for at the back of your,01:46:45.119,1.921
head should always be what's what's the,01:46:47.040,1.679
purpose like why am i here what's the,01:46:48.719,2.241
purpose of this and if i'm if if the,01:46:50.960,2.08
purpose is simply,01:46:53.040,2.36
self-aggrandizement then you should,01:46:55.400,1.719
rethink because it'll just end up being,01:46:57.119,1.761
a hall of life,01:46:58.880,2.16
all of us will be forgotten in the end,01:47:01.040,3.76
focus protection,01:47:04.800,1.76
the idea the policy what is focus,01:47:06.560,2.48
protection right so those i was saying,01:47:09.040,1.92
that there's two scientific bases right,01:47:10.960,2.08
so one is this the steep age gradient,01:47:13.040,2.0
the second is the existence of locked,01:47:15.040,1.679
arms again i think there's not very,01:47:16.719,1.44
little disagreement in the scientific,01:47:18.159,1.441
community of both of those facts,01:47:19.600,2.639
if you put those facts together,01:47:22.239,2.321
the obvious policy is to protect the,01:47:24.560,2.8
people who are at the most severe risk,01:47:27.360,2.08
from the disease itself,01:47:29.440,2.08
and that's the idea of focus protection,01:47:31.520,1.44
that's the general principle of it,01:47:32.960,2.159
the actual implementation of it depends,01:47:35.119,2.721
on the living circumstances of the,01:47:37.840,2.0
people that are at risk,01:47:39.840,1.68
the resources are available in the,01:47:41.520,1.44
community uh the the uh the technology,01:47:42.960,3.52
is available to do this,01:47:46.480,2.8
and so it's almost always going to be in,01:47:49.280,2.56
fact it'll always be a local thing,01:47:51.840,2.879
because it'll depend on the the the all,01:47:54.719,2.48
of those those things which are all,01:47:57.199,1.44
local in nature,01:47:58.639,1.52
right so one very very obvious thing in,01:48:00.159,3.201
a country like ours where so many older,01:48:03.360,2.56
people live in institutionalized,01:48:05.920,1.759
settings in nursing home settings,01:48:07.679,2.721
and that's where older really vulnerable,01:48:10.400,2.56
chronically ill patients often live,01:48:12.960,2.719
it is and you know this disease affects,01:48:15.679,2.0
that group most like most most commonly,01:48:17.679,2.081
it is absolutely vital to protect that,01:48:19.760,2.16
group,01:48:21.920,1.199
um we should have known that in february,01:48:23.119,2.56
2020 from just from the chinese data,01:48:25.679,4.081
and,01:48:30.159,0.721
we should have thought about that group,01:48:30.880,2.239
as the as this as the key constraint,01:48:33.119,3.12
in our policy making,01:48:36.239,2.0
um instead we thought about in february,01:48:38.239,2.48
march 2020 as hospital beds as the key,01:48:40.719,2.881
constraint,01:48:43.600,1.2
hospital beds and ventilator shortages,01:48:44.800,2.0
and that we so we we ran around trying,01:48:46.800,2.24
to like address that,01:48:49.040,2.079
constraint you know like a linear,01:48:51.119,1.681
programming problem you figure out what,01:48:52.800,1.12
the which constraints binding and you,01:48:53.920,1.52
address that one thing and then you go,01:48:55.440,1.36
to the next one right um if that's it's,01:48:56.800,2.72
that one constraint we said okay the,01:48:59.520,1.679
constraint is hospital beds,01:49:01.199,3.04
that led to the decision in many of the,01:49:04.239,2.88
northeast states to send,01:49:07.119,2.481
covet infected patients who were on on,01:49:09.600,2.0
the verge of like it looked like they,01:49:11.600,1.519
were about to recover back to nursing,01:49:13.119,2.161
homes,01:49:15.280,1.919
who then spread the disease all through,01:49:17.199,1.761
there because they wanted to preserve,01:49:18.960,1.12
the hospital beds,01:49:20.080,1.68
well for somebody who loves the miracle,01:49:21.760,2.56
optimization i love the way you frame,01:49:24.320,1.76
this,01:49:26.080,1.76
but those are kind of connected right if,01:49:27.840,2.56
you actually focus on protecting the,01:49:30.400,2.16
vulnerable you will also,01:49:32.560,2.8
have the effect of,01:49:35.360,2.08
not,01:49:37.440,0.799
hitting the ceiling of the available,01:49:38.239,2.161
that is that's the irony if we protected,01:49:40.400,2.239
the vulnerable the vulnerable the most,01:49:42.639,2.56
likely to be hospitalized and so by,01:49:45.199,2.321
protecting the hospital about protecting,01:49:47.520,1.76
the vulnerable we would also have,01:49:49.280,2.24
addressed the shortage of hospital,01:49:51.520,1.199
that's more effectively so that little,01:49:52.719,1.841
shift in priority would have had a big,01:49:54.560,2.0
impact,01:49:56.560,1.039
okay but specifically the idea is to,01:49:57.599,4.0
and we could talk about different ideas,01:50:01.599,1.921
of how to actually do this but uh you,01:50:03.520,2.159
know you,01:50:05.679,1.681
basically do a lockdown or something,01:50:07.360,2.08
like that on a very small set i mean you,01:50:09.440,2.96
may have to do that if it's community,01:50:12.400,1.6
spread is very high but generally i,01:50:14.000,1.52
think,01:50:15.520,1.679
it would depend on again the living,01:50:17.199,1.52
circumstances and the uh so so for,01:50:18.719,1.841
instance um,01:50:20.560,1.679
if you are in a if you have a here's a,01:50:22.239,2.4
very simple idea that doesn't require a,01:50:24.639,1.361
lockdown,01:50:26.000,1.44
forced on them i i don't actually,01:50:27.440,1.44
generally are not in favor of that kind,01:50:28.880,1.359
of force lockdown because you just won't,01:50:30.239,1.281
get cooperation,01:50:31.520,1.84
um but what you could do is provide,01:50:33.360,1.68
resources to,01:50:35.040,1.92
that group of people so like ima imagine,01:50:36.960,2.159
you live next door to somebody uh an,01:50:39.119,2.401
older couple,01:50:41.520,1.679
um and it's there's high community,01:50:43.199,1.761
spread,01:50:44.960,1.279
well they have to go grocery shopping,01:50:46.239,2.241
um we did like some of these some,01:50:48.480,1.6
communities did these like senior only,01:50:50.080,1.76
grocery hour right but but they have to,01:50:51.840,2.319
still have to go out and they might get,01:50:54.159,1.52
exposed in when they're shopping amongst,01:50:55.679,2.081
other seniors yeah,01:50:57.760,1.68
well why not organized home delivery of,01:50:59.440,2.56
groceries to them we did that for the,01:51:02.000,2.0
laptop class,01:51:04.000,1.679
right uh or or you can even just there's,01:51:05.679,2.0
a volunteer effort you know the older,01:51:07.679,1.601
people living next door just call them,01:51:09.280,1.359
up and say can i help you get uh go out,01:51:10.639,1.921
and go shopping for it and so you would,01:51:12.560,1.599
have potentially,01:51:14.159,1.44
federal support of that kind of thing so,01:51:15.599,1.921
these kinds of efforts and identify,01:51:17.520,2.56
where the vulnerable people live uh it's,01:51:20.080,2.159
really challenging in multi-generational,01:51:22.239,1.92
homes in l.a county for instance there's,01:51:24.159,1.44
a lot of,01:51:25.599,1.921
older people living together with,01:51:27.520,1.28
younger people in relatively crowded,01:51:28.800,2.72
they're they're it's really quite a,01:51:31.520,1.84
challenge but there again you can use,01:51:33.360,1.68
resources so if grandma uh,01:51:35.040,3.36
is worried that grandson has come home,01:51:38.400,2.239
but is potentially been exposed grandson,01:51:40.639,1.6
calls grandma says i've been i might,01:51:42.239,1.521
have been at a party where i might do,01:51:43.760,1.439
that where covid was grandma calls,01:51:45.199,2.48
public health public health and then,01:51:47.679,1.361
says okay you can have this hotel room,01:51:49.040,1.52
for a couple of days,01:51:50.560,1.28
until you check to turn negatives in,01:51:51.840,2.56
case it wasn't clear,01:51:54.400,1.6
the idea of focus protection,01:51:56.000,2.56
is the people that are,01:51:58.560,2.28
vulnerable protect them,01:52:00.840,2.12
and everybody else goes on with their,01:52:02.960,2.239
lives open up the economy just do as it,01:52:05.199,3.44
was before and there was still fear,01:52:08.639,1.841
abroad so there still would be some,01:52:10.480,1.679
restrictions people would pose on,01:52:12.159,1.361
themselves they probably would go to,01:52:13.520,1.52
parties less the grandsons probably,01:52:15.040,1.52
wouldn't go so many parties right um uh,01:52:16.560,2.32
that there would be less,01:52:18.880,1.68
less participation in big gatherings uh,01:52:20.560,2.8
you may even save like big gatherings in,01:52:23.360,1.759
order to restrict community spread again,01:52:25.119,2.161
i'm not against any of that,01:52:27.280,2.0
but you shouldn't be closing businesses,01:52:29.280,2.399
you shouldn't be closing churches and,01:52:31.679,1.601
synagogues you shouldn't be closing you,01:52:33.280,1.76
shouldn't be forcing people to not go to,01:52:35.040,2.72
to school you should,01:52:37.760,1.52
you should not be shuttering businesses,01:52:39.280,1.919
you should just let,01:52:41.199,1.281
just allow society to go on some disease,01:52:42.480,2.48
will spread but as we've seen the,01:52:44.960,1.92
lockdown didn't stop the disease from,01:52:46.880,1.279
spreading anyways,01:52:48.159,1.841
right so what do you make of the,01:52:50.000,1.84
criticism that this idea like,01:52:51.840,3.92
all good ideas,01:52:55.760,1.76
cannot actually be implemented in a,01:52:57.520,2.32
heterogeneous society where there's a,01:52:59.840,1.839
lot of people intermixing,01:53:01.679,1.92
and,01:53:03.599,0.961
once you open it up people like the the,01:53:04.560,3.039
younger people will just forget that,01:53:07.599,1.761
this is even existing and they'll stop,01:53:09.360,2.319
caring about the older people and mess,01:53:11.679,1.601
up the whole thing and the government,01:53:13.280,1.76
will not want to fund,01:53:15.040,1.679
any kind of the great efforts you're,01:53:16.719,1.52
talking about about food delivery and,01:53:18.239,1.681
then the food delivery services be like,01:53:19.920,2.239
why the heck am i helping out on this,01:53:22.159,1.761
anyway because like it's not making me,01:53:23.920,2.0
much money and so therefore like all,01:53:25.920,2.16
good ideas it will collapse,01:53:28.080,2.32
that might be true i mean i think it's,01:53:30.400,1.839
always a risk with policy thing but i,01:53:32.239,1.841
think like think back to the moment,01:53:34.080,3.2
we actually felt like we were in this,01:53:37.280,1.28
together to some extent yes,01:53:38.560,2.159
right i think i think that that um that,01:53:40.719,2.561
empathy that we had that was used to,01:53:43.280,2.0
like,01:53:45.280,2.24
tell people to stay in and like happily,01:53:47.520,2.56
not don't rule in happily but like stay,01:53:50.080,1.68
in,01:53:51.760,0.879
um to to like wear a mask or to to do,01:53:52.639,2.881
all these things that we thought would,01:53:55.520,1.76
help other people,01:53:57.280,1.439
could have been redirected to actually,01:53:58.719,1.681
helping the people who most needed to be,01:54:00.400,2.4
especially,01:54:02.800,1.2
i do remember,01:54:04.000,0.87
[Music],01:54:04.870,1.97
march uh so this is even way before,01:54:06.840,3.0
barrington all that kind of stuff,01:54:09.840,2.799
march april may,01:54:12.639,2.08
there was a feeling like if if we all,01:54:14.719,2.321
just work together,01:54:17.040,1.599
yeah we'll solve this right and that,01:54:18.639,2.48
maybe started to when did that start,01:54:21.119,2.161
breaking down i mean the,01:54:23.280,2.0
unfortunately the election is mixed into,01:54:25.280,2.319
this yeah that it became politicized but,01:54:27.599,3.361
i think it lasted quite a long time i,01:54:30.960,1.92
think into the summer i think there was,01:54:32.880,1.52
some some of that sense uh i don't know,01:54:34.400,2.64
they're obviously varied among different,01:54:37.040,1.36
people but um,01:54:38.400,1.279
but i think that it's true it would have,01:54:39.679,1.92
been challenging it's also true that,01:54:41.599,1.761
it's heterogeneous exactly the way you,01:54:43.360,2.239
said um but what that means is you need,01:54:45.599,2.321
a local response,01:54:47.920,1.84
a response so like like my vision of a,01:54:49.760,2.64
public health officer is someone that,01:54:52.400,1.6
understands their community,01:54:54.000,2.48
not not necessarily the nation at large,01:54:56.480,1.679
but their community and then works,01:54:58.159,2.08
within their community to figure out how,01:55:00.239,1.761
to deploy the resources that have,01:55:02.000,1.599
available,01:55:03.599,1.441
um to do the kind of protection policies,01:55:05.040,2.32
we're talking about that's that's what,01:55:07.360,1.44
should have happened instead they spent,01:55:08.800,2.16
a huge amount of efforts closing making,01:55:10.960,2.4
sure businesses stayed closed,01:55:13.360,2.08
businesses that,01:55:15.440,1.36
i mean there were you know like hardware,01:55:16.800,2.08
stores that closed,01:55:18.880,1.839
what good did closing a hardware store,01:55:20.719,1.761
do,01:55:22.480,1.36
for the spreader club if it had an,01:55:23.840,1.6
effect on spread covert spread i mean,01:55:25.440,1.84
it's going to be checking to make sure,01:55:27.280,1.52
that plexiglas was put up everywhere,01:55:28.800,2.16
which now in retrospect turns out to,01:55:30.960,1.52
have probably made the disease worse,01:55:32.480,2.96
um,01:55:35.440,1.44
you know masking enforcement,01:55:36.880,2.08
so shaming around mask i mean a huge,01:55:38.960,2.08
amount of effort on things that were,01:55:41.040,2.8
only tangentially related to focus,01:55:43.840,2.24
protection what if we turned our energy,01:55:46.080,3.039
that enormous energy put into that,01:55:49.119,3.04
instead into focused protection of the,01:55:52.159,1.681
vulnerable that's essentially the,01:55:53.840,1.279
conversation i was calling for,01:55:55.119,1.841
and it wasn't i mean i didn't think of,01:55:56.960,2.159
it as we had every single idea i mean we,01:55:59.119,1.921
gave some concrete proposals,01:56:01.040,2.0
and we got but the criticism we got was,01:56:03.040,1.52
that those those concrete proposals,01:56:04.560,1.52
weren't enough,01:56:06.080,1.92
and the answer to that i have is that's,01:56:08.000,1.84
true they weren't enough i wasn't,01:56:09.840,1.6
thinking of them as enough i was,01:56:11.440,1.279
thinking that they would i wanted to,01:56:12.719,1.761
involve an enormous number of people in,01:56:14.480,2.08
local public health to help think about,01:56:16.560,2.88
how to do focus protection in their,01:56:19.440,1.759
communities,01:56:21.199,2.0
the question that's interesting here is,01:56:23.199,2.721
about the future too,01:56:25.920,2.96
uh so uh covet has very specific,01:56:28.880,2.88
characteristics like you mentioned about,01:56:31.760,1.6
the curve of the the the death rate,01:56:33.360,2.799
based on the like it's it's uh it seems,01:56:36.159,2.48
like with covid it's a little bit easier,01:56:38.639,1.761
to actually identify a group of people,01:56:40.400,2.799
that you need to protect,01:56:43.199,2.321
so other viruses may not be this way so,01:56:45.520,3.599
might lock down be a good idea like hard,01:56:49.119,3.201
core lockdown for future virus,01:56:52.320,3.04
that's 10 times deadlier but spreads at,01:56:55.360,2.799
the same rate as covid or maybe another,01:56:58.159,2.321
way to ask that is imagine a virus,01:57:00.480,2.239
that's 10 times deadlier what's the,01:57:02.719,1.761
right response,01:57:04.480,1.6
i mean i think it's always going to be,01:57:06.080,1.44
focus protection but the group that,01:57:07.520,2.56
needs the focus protection may change,01:57:10.080,1.92
depending on the biology of the virus,01:57:12.000,2.08
right so the polio,01:57:14.080,1.519
epidemic in the 40s and 50s in the u.s,01:57:15.599,2.881
the the great the people at most risk,01:57:18.480,2.639
were children,01:57:21.119,1.921
we didn't know really at the beginning,01:57:23.040,1.76
there was this vehicle oral spread,01:57:24.800,2.08
and so we did all kinds of crazy things,01:57:26.880,2.64
um,01:57:29.520,0.8
including like spreading spraying ddt in,01:57:30.320,2.319
communities,01:57:32.639,1.52
which was somehow supposed to get rid of,01:57:34.159,1.52
polio um but the focus was on whenever,01:57:35.679,3.52
there was an outbreak they would close a,01:57:39.199,1.281
school down,01:57:40.480,1.44
and that was the right thing to do,01:57:41.920,1.679
because that group that needed,01:57:43.599,1.921
protection,01:57:45.520,1.28
where it was,01:57:46.800,1.359
children and those the disease was,01:57:48.159,1.681
spread we thought in schools,01:57:49.840,3.6
i don't think there's a single formula,01:57:53.440,1.92
that works but there's a single,01:57:55.360,1.92
principle that works right no matter i,01:57:57.280,2.8
can't it's hard to imagine a disease,01:58:00.080,2.0
that's uniformly deadly across every,01:58:02.080,2.88
group and every single person,01:58:04.960,2.08
there's always going to be some group,01:58:07.040,2.559
that's differentially,01:58:09.599,2.64
harmed,01:58:12.239,1.121
uh there's always going to be some group,01:58:13.360,1.279
that's differentially protected and that,01:58:14.639,1.841
that may change over time right so like,01:58:16.480,1.759
the in the uh,01:58:18.239,2.321
in this disease in this epidemic,01:58:20.560,2.72
as people got infected and recovered we,01:58:23.280,2.64
now had a class of people that were,01:58:25.920,1.36
pretty well protected against the,01:58:27.280,1.2
disease,01:58:28.480,2.4
they should be they would like instead,01:58:30.880,1.92
of ostracizing them because they don't,01:58:32.800,1.839
want a vaccine we should we should be,01:58:34.639,2.08
allowing them to work i mean we're,01:58:36.719,1.52
having,01:58:38.239,0.88
staffing shortages in hospitals now,01:58:39.119,2.0
because we forgot that principle,01:58:41.119,2.161
is uh,01:58:43.280,1.12
quite a bit of this a technology problem,01:58:44.400,2.08
so being able to so some of it how much,01:58:46.480,3.36
of it is this uh sociological problem,01:58:49.840,3.68
uh how much of it is a technology,01:58:53.520,1.52
problem,01:58:55.040,1.199
like where do you uh put the blame,01:58:56.239,2.721
sort of on why this didn't go so great,01:58:58.960,2.56
and how it can go great in the beginning,01:59:01.520,2.48
i mean think about lockdowns like if we,01:59:04.000,2.0
didn't have zoom we wouldn't have,01:59:06.000,1.44
lockdowns right there's,01:59:07.440,1.84
there's a reason in 2009 we didn't lock,01:59:09.280,1.919
down i mean we didn't have the,01:59:11.199,1.121
technology to replace work with this,01:59:12.320,1.6
remote,01:59:13.920,0.96
um with this remote technology,01:59:14.880,2.96
so we had good lockdown technology yeah,01:59:17.840,2.64
and zoom we didn't have,01:59:20.480,2.48
good focus protection technology yeah i,01:59:22.960,2.48
mean focus protection is always going to,01:59:25.440,1.12
be complicated especially for something,01:59:26.560,1.44
like this that's spread so easily it's,01:59:28.000,1.52
going to be complicated and i'm i'm very,01:59:29.520,2.88
i'm the last person to say would have,01:59:32.400,1.36
been perfect there's there would have,01:59:33.760,2.0
been people that would have gotten sick,01:59:35.760,1.839
but they got sick anyways the hope was,01:59:37.599,2.0
that if we suppress community spread low,01:59:39.599,2.08
enough,01:59:41.679,1.04
we can protect the vulnerable,01:59:42.719,1.681
that was the hope by lockdown,01:59:44.400,2.64
the reality was that,01:59:47.040,1.92
only a certain class of people were able,01:59:48.960,1.679
to benefit from a lockdown the rest of,01:59:50.639,1.441
society we call them essential workers,01:59:52.080,1.599
had to keep working and they got sick,01:59:53.679,2.0
yeah,01:59:55.679,0.801
and the disease kept spreading it didn't,01:59:56.480,2.08
actually have a substantial effect on,01:59:58.560,1.76
community spread in the in in non,02:00:00.320,3.12
laptop class populations,02:00:03.440,2.4
and also we should probably expand the,02:00:05.840,1.6
class of people who call vulnerable to,02:00:07.440,2.48
those who would suffer who have the,02:00:09.920,3.04
capacity to suffer,02:00:12.960,2.88
given the policies they're you're,02:00:15.840,2.08
weighing,02:00:17.920,1.04
it's very,02:00:18.960,1.36
disingenuous to call the vulnerable just,02:00:20.320,2.56
the people,02:00:22.880,1.2
obviously we had the very specific,02:00:24.080,1.599
meaning but broadly speaking vulnerable,02:00:25.679,3.761
should uh include anybody who can suffer,02:00:29.440,3.199
based on the policies you take in,02:00:32.639,2.241
response to a virus there's something,02:00:34.880,1.52
this is that principle you just said as,02:00:36.400,1.68
i completely agree with is is uh,02:00:38.080,1.68
something i think has been lost,02:00:39.760,2.08
uh,02:00:41.840,0.799
and unfortunately lost right so,02:00:42.639,2.56
the policies themselves,02:00:45.199,2.4
if they have harm those are real,02:00:47.599,3.04
yeah and we shouldn't pretend like,02:00:50.639,1.361
they're not,02:00:52.000,1.36
and and and essentially demonize the,02:00:53.360,2.239
people that that that suffer them,02:00:55.599,2.56
or pretend i mean like us a lot of times,02:00:58.159,2.241
like the depression that we've been,02:01:00.400,1.44
talking about that's,02:01:01.840,1.839
thought of as like not as not so,02:01:03.679,1.52
important but it is important uh and uh,02:01:05.199,3.761
uh especially the the harm to the people,02:01:08.960,2.159
in poor countries it's like been out of,02:01:11.119,2.161
sight item out of mind in much of the,02:01:13.280,2.16
rich parts of the world,02:01:15.440,1.44
once again i've hoped that we,02:01:16.880,2.48
seeing this learning the lessons of,02:01:19.360,1.839
history with the communication tools who,02:01:21.199,1.841
have now will learn this it's like going,02:01:23.040,1.76
to another country and bombing targeted,02:01:24.800,2.56
terrorist locations,02:01:27.360,1.92
and there's going to be some civilians,02:01:29.280,1.68
who die,02:01:30.960,1.04
pretending that that,02:01:32.000,2.159
the child who watches their dad die is,02:01:34.159,3.681
not going to grow up first of all,02:01:37.840,1.759
traumatized but second of all,02:01:39.599,1.6
potentially bring more hate to the world,02:01:41.199,2.561
than uh the hate that you were allegedly,02:01:43.760,2.64
fighting in the first place that's,02:01:46.400,1.279
another sort of,02:01:47.679,1.681
um considering only one kind of harm and,02:01:49.360,3.2
not the full range of harms that are,02:01:52.560,1.599
being caused by your policies you know,02:01:54.159,1.921
like the good return to focus protection,02:01:56.080,2.639
we we still should be following the,02:01:58.719,1.52
policy now for covet and we're not,02:02:00.239,2.48
right so the vaccines,02:02:02.719,2.161
are there's a great shortage in vaccines,02:02:04.880,1.839
you wouldn't know it in the united,02:02:06.719,1.201
states and in rich parts of the world,02:02:07.920,1.759
but in there's a great shortage of,02:02:09.679,1.52
vaccines we're not going to be able to,02:02:11.199,1.121
vaccinate the um most of the like the,02:02:12.320,3.12
entire set of elderly at least and or,02:02:15.440,2.64
larger groups until late 2022.,02:02:18.080,2.88
huge numbers of older people around the,02:02:20.960,2.719
world in poor countries that have not,02:02:23.679,2.161
had not covered recovered yet so they're,02:02:25.840,1.759
still quite vulnerable have not had the,02:02:27.599,1.921
vaccine,02:02:29.520,1.199
and yet we're talking about vaccinating,02:02:30.719,1.361
five-year-olds,02:02:32.080,1.28
yeah,02:02:33.360,1.04
who benefit,02:02:34.400,1.6
if at all from the vaccines of just a,02:02:36.000,1.84
very little bit because they face such a,02:02:37.840,1.52
low risk of harm from covid,02:02:39.360,3.52
well something that's a little bit,02:02:42.880,2.16
near and dear to our specific the two of,02:02:45.040,2.72
our hearts uh so you're at stanford,02:02:47.760,3.439
so stanford recently,02:02:51.199,1.92
announced that they're going back to,02:02:53.119,1.361
virtual,02:02:54.480,1.119
at least for some period of time in,02:02:55.599,2.0
response to the esc maybe you can,02:02:57.599,2.0
clarify but i think it's in response to,02:02:59.599,1.761
the escalated um,02:03:01.360,3.04
holiday phrase it's related to omicron,02:03:04.400,3.44
and uh a few other universities are kind,02:03:07.840,2.64
of like,02:03:10.480,1.199
uh considering back and forth in my,02:03:11.679,2.241
perspective,02:03:13.920,1.279
as somebody who loves in-person lectures,02:03:15.199,3.04
who,02:03:18.239,1.041
um,02:03:19.280,1.2
sees the value of that,02:03:20.480,2.56
to students to young minds,02:03:23.040,2.72
also looking at the data,02:03:25.760,2.72
seems,02:03:28.480,1.6
the,02:03:30.080,0.68
[Music],02:03:30.760,1.399
risk aversion,02:03:32.159,2.08
in university policies around this given,02:03:34.239,3.36
how healthy the student population is,02:03:37.599,3.281
seems not well calibrated let's put it,02:03:40.880,3.44
this way also pathological pathological,02:03:44.320,2.72
is one way to put it given that i,02:03:47.040,2.079
believe depending on the university but,02:03:49.119,1.6
i think,02:03:50.719,0.88
many universities require that the,02:03:51.599,1.761
student body is vaccinated,02:03:53.360,2.0
at this point,02:03:55.360,1.68
so,02:03:57.040,0.88
i think it's a big mistake by stanford,02:03:57.920,2.0
to do this,02:03:59.920,1.12
and um,02:04:01.040,1.76
i i'd like to say that because i just,02:04:02.800,1.6
hope mit doesn't,02:04:04.400,2.88
but what are your thoughts about,02:04:07.280,1.439
everything things,02:04:08.719,1.36
i completely agree with you i think um,02:04:10.079,2.08
we have,02:04:12.159,1.04
failed in our mission,02:04:13.199,1.681
to educate our students,02:04:14.880,2.0
by these this decision uh and i think i,02:04:16.880,2.88
frankly just more broadly i think we,02:04:19.760,1.439
failed generally over the course of the,02:04:21.199,1.841
last year and a half in living up to our,02:04:23.040,2.0
educational mission,02:04:25.040,2.639
the in-person,02:04:27.679,1.361
teaching is vital,02:04:29.040,2.4
for and now i can understand you have,02:04:31.440,2.32
you have older faculty,02:04:33.760,1.76
the principle of focus protection says,02:04:35.520,1.599
provide some alternative teaching,02:04:37.119,1.441
arrangements for them,02:04:38.560,1.599
that makes sense to me,02:04:40.159,2.321
from the kids point of view,02:04:42.480,1.84
they're more harmed by not getting the,02:04:44.320,2.0
education we promised them,02:04:46.320,2.0
than by than by covid,02:04:48.320,3.04
so applying this principle of this focus,02:04:51.360,2.239
protection,02:04:53.599,1.361
let young professors teach in person,02:04:54.960,3.04
this is before the vaccine after the,02:04:58.000,1.36
vaccine let everyone teach in person,02:04:59.360,1.759
yeah this this the part i don't,02:05:01.119,1.281
understand the discussion we're even,02:05:02.400,1.36
having,02:05:03.760,2.08
um,02:05:05.840,1.44
okay let's leave focus protection aside,02:05:07.280,2.56
here because that's a brilliant policy,02:05:09.840,2.319
for perhaps for the future when there's,02:05:12.159,2.0
no vaccine,02:05:14.159,1.52
now with the vaccine i'm i'm,02:05:15.679,2.121
misunderstanding something here because,02:05:17.800,2.6
we're now in a space,02:05:20.400,2.239
that's,02:05:22.639,0.96
psychological not it's no longer about,02:05:23.599,2.961
biology because,02:05:26.560,2.24
uh with the booster shots which i,02:05:28.800,2.16
believe mit is now requiring before,02:05:30.960,2.4
january,02:05:33.360,1.44
with the booster shots the data shows no,02:05:34.800,2.399
matter how old you are the risks are,02:05:37.199,3.121
very low,02:05:40.320,1.44
for um,02:05:41.760,1.28
ending up in a hospital,02:05:43.040,1.679
relative to all the other risks you face,02:05:44.719,2.241
when you're older,02:05:46.960,2.4
i don't i don't understand can you,02:05:49.360,2.4
explain the policy around,02:05:51.760,2.879
closing,02:05:54.639,1.121
a university but also just a,02:05:55.760,2.959
policy about,02:05:58.719,1.52
just being so,02:06:00.239,2.48
uh scared still,02:06:02.719,1.92
in the university setting i think the,02:06:04.639,1.841
universities the great university has,02:06:06.480,1.679
done great harm,02:06:08.159,1.601
by modeling this kind of behavior yes,02:06:09.760,2.72
that to me decided to keep interrupting,02:06:12.480,2.639
but to me the university should be the,02:06:15.119,2.08
beacon of great behavior not not the,02:06:17.199,3.44
beacon of like,02:06:20.639,1.44
scared conservative,02:06:22.079,2.64
let's not mess up,02:06:24.719,1.681
let's not make it pathological it's not,02:06:26.400,1.759
make anybody angry let's it should be a,02:06:28.159,3.361
place to play in the space of ideas yes,02:06:31.520,3.04
so i think um the central problem is,02:06:34.560,3.039
actually related to the central problem,02:06:37.599,1.361
of covet policy more generally,02:06:38.960,2.32
the goal seems to be,02:06:41.280,1.76
to stop the disease from spreading,02:06:43.040,3.199
rather than to reduce the harm from the,02:06:46.239,2.721
disease,02:06:48.960,2.4
if the if the goal is to stop disease,02:06:51.520,1.84
and spreading the sad fact is we have no,02:06:53.360,2.799
technology to stop to accomplish that,02:06:56.159,2.96
at this point yes because like uh it's,02:06:59.119,2.48
already deeply integrated into the human,02:07:01.599,2.48
civilization well i mean it's here,02:07:04.079,2.0
forever right there's a zero survey of,02:07:06.079,2.881
white-tailed deer in the u.s it turns,02:07:08.960,2.32
out 80 percent of white-tailed deer in,02:07:11.280,1.6
the u.s have coveted antibodies,02:07:12.880,2.799
dogs get it cats get it,02:07:15.679,2.161
there's almost certainly human human,02:07:17.840,1.68
animal transmission of it um,02:07:19.520,2.8
i mean presumably i mean i've heard bats,02:07:22.320,1.6
get it apparently,02:07:23.920,1.52
so so you you have uh you have a,02:07:25.440,2.159
situation where you have this disease,02:07:27.599,1.841
that's here to stay yeah and it and the,02:07:29.440,2.239
vaccines don't stop the spread of it the,02:07:31.679,1.681
lockdowns don't stop spread it we have,02:07:33.360,1.68
no technology to stop the spread of it,02:07:35.040,3.199
um and so we're burning the earth trying,02:07:38.239,1.92
to stop do something that's impossible,02:07:40.159,2.801
rather than,02:07:42.960,2.239
working on what's possible,02:07:45.199,2.0
uh and so like you know like letting,02:07:47.199,3.281
regular college happen that's a great,02:07:50.480,1.92
good universities are a wonderful,02:07:52.400,2.719
invention,02:07:55.119,1.201
and it's contributed so much to society,02:07:56.320,2.319
to decide to shut it down,02:07:58.639,2.08
the universities should be fighting,02:08:00.719,1.92
tooth and nail to not be shut down not,02:08:02.639,2.0
the other way around yeah,02:08:04.639,2.401
whatever the mechanisms that uh results,02:08:07.040,2.159
in the universities doing that that's,02:08:09.199,1.44
probably this is me talking it probably,02:08:10.639,2.241
has to do with certain incentives for,02:08:12.880,1.6
the administration probably has to do,02:08:14.480,1.599
with lawyers and legal kinds of things,02:08:16.079,1.761
to,02:08:17.840,0.879
to avoid uh legal trouble but once again,02:08:18.719,4.321
it's when the administration has too,02:08:23.040,1.76
much power and too much uh definition of,02:08:24.800,2.56
what the policy is for the university,02:08:27.360,1.68
that's when you get into trouble the,02:08:29.040,1.84
beauty,02:08:30.880,0.96
the power of the university should be,02:08:31.840,1.68
about the faculty and the students,02:08:33.520,2.719
administration,02:08:36.239,2.241
just gets in the way,02:08:38.480,1.759
get out of the way i mean they can help,02:08:40.239,1.761
organize things they they play some,02:08:42.000,1.76
important role but they certainly do but,02:08:43.760,2.08
they need to remember what the mission,02:08:45.840,1.359
is the mission is not,02:08:47.199,2.241
safety the mission actually university,02:08:49.440,2.639
should be dangerous places you know for,02:08:52.079,1.841
ideas and and and whatnot,02:08:53.920,2.96
what is the role of fear in a pandemic,02:08:56.880,2.16
we've been dancing around it is it,02:08:59.040,1.92
useful is it destructive or is there,02:09:00.960,2.8
sort of a complicated story here because,02:09:03.760,2.319
uh instead of taking us back into,02:09:06.079,1.841
january 2020,02:09:07.920,1.92
there's so much uncertainty this could,02:09:09.840,1.92
have been a pandemic that,02:09:11.760,2.479
um,02:09:14.239,0.88
is black death the bubonic plague it,02:09:15.119,2.721
could have killed,02:09:17.840,1.68
hundreds of millions of people we don't,02:09:19.520,1.76
know that,02:09:21.280,1.2
we're we're very new to this it's been a,02:09:22.480,1.92
while we're rusty,02:09:24.400,2.0
so like there is there is some value to,02:09:26.400,2.4
fear so that you don't do the stupid,02:09:28.800,2.16
thing you don't just go on living i,02:09:30.960,2.08
guess where i come from i think it's,02:09:33.040,1.36
almost entirely counterproductive,02:09:34.400,2.16
i think fear should never be used as a,02:09:36.560,2.639
tactic to manipulate human behavior,02:09:39.199,3.601
by public health so the fear on the,02:09:42.800,2.08
individual level,02:09:44.880,2.16
that feeling of fear you should be very,02:09:47.040,2.24
hesitant about that feeling because it,02:09:49.280,2.08
could be easily manipulated by the,02:09:51.360,1.839
powerful exactly so i think um that fear,02:09:53.199,3.04
is natural,02:09:56.239,1.601
and it it uh it's not something that you,02:09:57.840,2.72
have to you have to nest you have to,02:10:00.560,1.76
stoke to get when the facts on the,02:10:02.320,2.24
ground suggest it,02:10:04.560,1.84
right uh in fact the tendency for humans,02:10:06.400,2.719
in the in the face of,02:10:09.119,2.161
threats from infects disease is to is to,02:10:11.280,2.399
exaggerate the fear in their own minds,02:10:13.679,2.56
of the being contaminated by the,02:10:16.239,2.241
environment and by others that's just,02:10:18.480,2.0
natural to humans,02:10:20.480,2.08
and,02:10:22.560,0.96
the role of public health is not,02:10:23.520,2.159
necessarily to eradicate the fear but,02:10:25.679,2.161
like obviously technological advances,02:10:27.840,1.44
can help eradicate the fear but like but,02:10:29.280,1.76
it's really to help manage that fear,02:10:31.040,2.48
and,02:10:33.520,1.04
and uh help people put the the sort of,02:10:34.560,4.079
incentives that come out of that to,02:10:38.639,1.6
useful things as opposed to harmful,02:10:40.239,1.681
things,02:10:41.920,2.319
what's happened in this pandemic is that,02:10:44.320,2.16
there's been a deliberate policy to,02:10:46.480,1.84
stoke the fear,02:10:48.320,1.44
to help make people think that the,02:10:49.760,1.839
disease is worse than it actually is,02:10:51.599,2.48
in survey after survey you see this,02:10:54.079,2.401
and that's been incredibly damaging so,02:10:56.480,2.56
young people,02:10:59.040,1.44
have readily given away their,02:11:00.480,2.719
willingness participating in regular,02:11:03.199,1.44
life,02:11:04.639,0.801
because a they fear covid more than they,02:11:05.440,2.88
ought,02:11:08.320,1.359
and b they feared that they're going to,02:11:09.679,1.601
harm the vulnerable,02:11:11.280,2.24
in their lives,02:11:13.520,1.599
you put those two together and you just,02:11:15.119,1.6
that you get this powerful demand for,02:11:16.719,1.601
lockdowns you see this all over the,02:11:18.320,1.44
world,02:11:19.760,1.28
broadly speaking you have a powerful,02:11:21.040,1.84
demand for rational policies irrational,02:11:22.880,2.96
policies because i would like to mention,02:11:25.840,1.52
the flip side of that,02:11:27.360,1.68
i've been saddened to see how much money,02:11:29.040,3.599
there is to be made,02:11:32.639,2.08
by the martyrs,02:11:34.719,2.641
the people,02:11:37.360,1.2
the conspiracy theorists,02:11:38.560,2.0
that tell you,02:11:40.560,2.24
you should be afraid of the government,02:11:42.800,3.6
you should be afraid of the man,02:11:46.400,2.719
it feels like fear is the problem i,02:11:49.119,2.56
think there's some guy that once said,02:11:51.679,1.601
something about we should be we should,02:11:53.280,1.6
fear fear itself,02:11:54.880,2.64
uh,02:11:57.520,1.199
he was a president or something i,02:11:58.719,1.281
vaguely remember that,02:12:00.000,1.679
so i i so i'm worried about both sides,02:12:01.679,2.881
here that well i just i think the,02:12:04.560,2.32
general principle is that should not be,02:12:06.880,1.92
a tool of public policy right,02:12:08.800,2.24
right the true the public policy should,02:12:11.040,1.92
attempt and public health policy in,02:12:12.960,1.679
particular should attempt to address,02:12:14.639,1.201
that fear,02:12:15.840,1.12
uh,02:12:16.960,1.279
it's not that you should,02:12:18.239,2.161
tell people lies of course not tell,02:12:20.400,2.56
people accurately what the risk is,02:12:22.960,3.44
give people tools that have evidence,02:12:26.400,2.48
that they can address their risk with,02:12:28.880,2.88
um,02:12:31.760,1.08
and level with people when we don't know,02:12:32.840,3.239
i think that is the right adult way for,02:12:36.079,2.56
to deal with this pandemic from public,02:12:38.639,1.681
health point of view and that's that is,02:12:40.320,2.24
not the policy we have followed instead,02:12:42.560,2.72
public health has intentionally stoked,02:12:45.280,1.68
the fear in order to gain compliance,02:12:46.960,1.92
with his edicts,02:12:48.880,1.52
and i think the consequence of that is,02:12:50.400,3.52
people distrust public health,02:12:53.920,2.56
what you're talking about the distrust,02:12:56.480,1.36
of government i think is a partly a,02:12:57.840,1.6
consequence of that that that movement,02:12:59.440,1.84
which is much smaller once upon a time,02:13:01.280,2.0
is much larger now,02:13:03.280,1.68
because of essentially people look at,02:13:04.960,2.48
what the what public health has done and,02:13:07.440,1.679
said i mean they've lied to me a whole,02:13:09.119,2.401
bunch of times a whole bunch of things,02:13:11.520,1.92
is the general sense and there are,02:13:13.440,2.08
consequences of that,02:13:15.520,1.599
we're going to have to work in public,02:13:17.119,1.361
health for a long time to try to regain,02:13:18.480,2.239
the trust of the public,02:13:20.719,2.081
throughout all of this you've been,02:13:22.800,2.0
inspiring to me to a lot of people,02:13:24.800,2.879
you've been,02:13:27.679,1.601
uh fearless,02:13:29.280,1.68
uh bold,02:13:30.960,1.6
in these kind of challenging the,02:13:32.560,2.0
policies,02:13:34.560,1.44
and not in in a martyr kind of way,02:13:36.000,2.96
because you're walking,02:13:38.960,1.84
the line gracefully and beautifully i,02:13:40.800,2.08
would say,02:13:42.880,1.52
and,02:13:44.400,1.6
looking at that,02:13:46.000,1.92
i think you're an inspiration to a lot,02:13:47.920,1.6
of young people so i have to ask what,02:13:49.520,2.4
advice would you give them,02:13:51.920,1.92
if they're thinking of going into,02:13:53.840,1.68
science if they're thinking of having an,02:13:55.520,3.04
impact in the world what advice would,02:13:58.560,1.44
you give them about,02:14:00.000,1.679
their career,02:14:01.679,2.0
and maybe about their life thinking,02:14:03.679,2.4
about somebody in high school maybe an,02:14:06.079,1.921
undergraduate college i'd say a few,02:14:08.000,2.159
things one is this is a wonderful,02:14:10.159,2.08
profession you have an opportunity to,02:14:12.239,2.96
improve the lives of so many and do it,02:14:15.199,2.4
by having fun,02:14:17.599,1.52
the kind of play we're talking about,02:14:19.119,1.681
it's an absolute privilege,02:14:20.800,2.24
to be able to work in this kind of area,02:14:23.040,2.48
um,02:14:25.520,0.88
uh and to young people looking to say,02:14:26.400,2.08
that that have,02:14:28.480,1.52
some gifts or desired for for this area,02:14:30.000,2.639
i say please you know,02:14:32.639,1.761
go for it like do serious science,02:14:34.400,2.48
broadly yeah i mean it could be it could,02:14:36.880,2.239
be i mean i'm not i don't have any gifts,02:14:39.119,1.6
in ai but like you know it could be your,02:14:40.719,1.281
buddy but you know or in health or or in,02:14:42.000,2.4
medicine or whatever whatever your gifts,02:14:44.400,2.48
lie develop them work hard and develop,02:14:46.880,2.16
them because it's worth it it's worth it,02:14:49.040,1.52
not just um,02:14:50.560,1.92
not just because you get some status but,02:14:52.480,2.0
because the the journey is fun,02:14:54.480,2.32
and the result is uh improvement to the,02:14:56.800,2.319
lives of so many so i think that that is,02:14:59.119,2.401
the encouragement i give i'd also say if,02:15:01.520,2.88
you're looking at this ugliness of this,02:15:04.400,1.759
debate that's happened over the pandemic,02:15:06.159,2.96
i i'd say to young people we need you to,02:15:09.119,2.241
come come in and help transform it many,02:15:11.360,2.56
of the people you see in this debate,02:15:13.920,1.04
that behave poorly,02:15:14.960,2.0
i actually forgive them i've done my,02:15:16.960,2.159
best to try,02:15:19.119,1.361
um,02:15:20.480,1.199
because,02:15:21.679,0.881
their act their many of them are acting,02:15:22.560,1.84
out of their own sense that they're that,02:15:24.400,2.0
they need to do good but they've but the,02:15:26.400,1.92
mistake they've made is is in in is in,02:15:28.320,2.399
this arrogance and this power but when,02:15:30.719,1.841
you come in remember that example as a,02:15:32.560,1.76
negative example and so that you when,02:15:34.320,2.16
you join the debate,02:15:36.480,1.759
you'll join it in a spirit of humility,02:15:38.239,2.081
in the spirit of trying to learn um,02:15:40.320,2.0
while keeping that that love of,02:15:42.320,2.56
that led you to enter the field in the,02:15:44.880,1.759
first place,02:15:46.639,1.52
and yeah,02:15:48.159,1.52
choose forgiveness versus like derision,02:15:49.679,2.541
[Music],02:15:52.220,1.06
um,02:15:53.280,1.04
like the people that,02:15:54.320,1.6
you know have messed up like give them a,02:15:55.920,2.319
pass,02:15:58.239,1.041
because that's how,02:15:59.280,1.6
it feels like that's how improvement,02:16:00.880,1.52
starts funny i've been thinking this,02:16:02.400,1.92
it's like uh,02:16:04.320,1.2
i told you i'm christian right so like i,02:16:05.520,1.92
thought like god has given me many,02:16:07.440,2.0
opportunities to forgive people learn,02:16:09.440,2.0
learn to practice how to do that give,02:16:11.440,1.279
you a gift it's a very humbling thing i,02:16:12.719,2.0
guess,02:16:14.719,0.721
is there a,02:16:15.440,1.4
memory,02:16:16.840,1.56
from when you were young that was very,02:16:18.400,2.16
formative to you,02:16:20.560,1.599
so you just gave advice to some young,02:16:22.159,1.761
people is there something that stands,02:16:23.920,1.679
out to you that uh,02:16:25.599,3.281
a decision you made an event that,02:16:28.880,2.319
happened that made you the man you are,02:16:31.199,2.32
today,02:16:33.519,1.84
i actually grew up in a relatively poor,02:16:35.359,2.401
environment like i was born in india,02:16:37.760,2.558
and i moved when i was four,02:16:40.318,2.32
my dad had uh eight brothers and sisters,02:16:42.638,3.522
and my mom had four brothers and sisters,02:16:46.160,2.158
she uh grew up in the salomon in,02:16:48.318,2.4
calcutta,02:16:50.718,1.522
my dad his dad died when he was young,02:16:52.240,2.478
and he supported his family his kid his,02:16:54.718,1.68
brothers and sisters with university,02:16:56.398,1.281
scholarship money,02:16:57.679,1.361
came to the u.s and my dad worked,02:16:59.040,2.559
in a mcdonald's even though he's an,02:17:01.599,1.2
electrical engineer couldn't find a job,02:17:02.799,2.08
in 1971 and so he worked at mcdonald's,02:17:04.879,3.679
um we lived in a in a uh like this this,02:17:08.558,3.282
basically like this the housing port,02:17:11.840,2.4
like development uh in in in cambridge,02:17:14.240,2.639
this like this middle building of the,02:17:16.879,1.361
17th floor of this like housing,02:17:18.240,1.279
development,02:17:19.519,1.039
um,02:17:20.558,0.881
i mean i i think that was transformative,02:17:21.439,3.039
for me like i didn't realize so much at,02:17:24.478,2.16
the time how that experience of being,02:17:26.638,3.522
essentially like,02:17:30.160,1.6
poor lower middle class,02:17:31.760,1.839
what effect it had on my outlook,02:17:33.599,2.561
you mentioned to me offline that you,02:17:36.160,1.359
listened to a conversation that i had,02:17:37.519,1.92
with my dad what what impact did your,02:17:39.439,2.0
dad have in your life what uh what,02:17:41.439,2.0
memories do you have about him he was a,02:17:43.439,2.08
rocket scientist actually,02:17:45.519,1.84
he,02:17:47.359,1.279
helped design rocket guidance systems he,02:17:48.638,2.321
died when i was 20,02:17:50.959,2.0
and i still miss him to this day,02:17:52.959,2.241
and i think that,02:17:55.200,1.438
experience of seeing him,02:17:56.638,2.08
sacrifice,02:17:58.718,1.282
his hidden self for his family,02:18:00.000,3.599
a brilliant man but uh in many ways,02:18:03.599,2.401
frustrated with like the the his,02:18:06.000,2.0
opportunities in the world which,02:18:08.000,1.28
publicly would let him to come to the,02:18:09.280,1.118
u.s in the first place,02:18:10.398,2.32
that's,02:18:12.718,1.122
transformed that's had a transformative,02:18:13.840,1.599
effect on me and i wish i could tell him,02:18:15.439,2.0
that,02:18:17.439,0.959
looking back,02:18:18.398,2.641
do you,02:18:21.519,1.681
think about your own mortality do you,02:18:23.200,2.159
think about your death your dad is no,02:18:25.359,2.24
longer with us,02:18:27.599,1.681
you're the,02:18:29.280,1.519
the old wise sage,02:18:30.799,2.56
that represents it's funny,02:18:33.359,2.32
i've only,02:18:35.679,1.2
worried about death uh once in this,02:18:36.879,2.241
pandemic although i've had two of my,02:18:39.120,2.08
cousin,02:18:41.200,0.88
who was 73 and my my uncle was 74 die,02:18:42.080,4.0
in india during the pandemic and i,02:18:46.080,2.08
grieved them both from covid um,02:18:48.160,4.478
like the fear of covid really has only,02:18:52.638,1.84
hit me,02:18:54.478,0.961
only really literally once during this,02:18:55.439,1.841
it wasn't for me,02:18:57.280,1.92
and i recognized it's irrational so on,02:18:59.200,2.08
the eve of the santa clara county zero,02:19:01.280,2.48
prevalent study,02:19:03.760,1.44
um it was it was a really interesting,02:19:05.200,2.399
thing because so many people volunteered,02:19:07.599,2.0
to help,02:19:09.599,1.521
and um my my my daughter,02:19:11.120,2.88
who's 20 she was i guess was 19 at the,02:19:14.000,2.318
time and my wife also volunteered to,02:19:16.318,1.762
help with like various aspects of the,02:19:18.080,2.0
study and so the eve of the study they,02:19:20.080,2.0
were going to go out in public,02:19:22.080,1.92
and i didn't know what the death rate,02:19:24.000,1.359
was because we hadn't done the study,02:19:25.359,2.32
and i suspected it was lower than people,02:19:27.679,2.081
were saying but i didn't know,02:19:29.760,1.759
i knew,02:19:31.519,1.199
about the age gradient because i'd seen,02:19:32.718,1.6
the chinese data,02:19:34.318,1.361
and my my daughter is young but my wife,02:19:35.679,2.0
is my age,02:19:37.679,1.361
and i didn't know the death rate,02:19:39.040,1.759
and i couldn't sleep the night before,02:19:40.799,2.64
like what if i'm putting my family,02:19:43.439,2.401
my kid my daughter and my wife at risk,02:19:45.840,2.718
because of some some activity that i'm,02:19:48.558,1.921
doing,02:19:50.479,1.121
um it was kind of i don't know i mean it,02:19:51.600,1.92
was so worried about the well-being,02:19:53.520,3.36
and of others yeah when you look in the,02:19:56.880,2.72
mirror i if i die i die i mean like i,02:19:59.600,2.24
just it's not i again i'm christian so i,02:20:01.840,2.479
don't death is not the end for me uh i,02:20:04.319,2.401
believe um and so i don't i don't,02:20:06.720,2.0
particularly worried about my own death,02:20:08.720,1.679
but i i do,02:20:10.399,2.561
i mean i just i think we can't help but,02:20:12.960,1.439
we worry about the the well-being of our,02:20:14.399,1.521
loved ones,02:20:15.920,1.6
so,02:20:17.520,1.68
from the perspective of god then let me,02:20:19.200,2.08
ask you um,02:20:21.280,1.92
what do you think is the meaning of this,02:20:23.200,1.44
whole journey we're on what do you think,02:20:24.640,1.52
is the meaning of life,02:20:26.160,1.68
no it's very simple love one another,02:20:27.840,2.8
treat your neighbor as yourself,02:20:30.640,1.839
it's love yeah simple as that,02:20:32.479,3.121
well i'd love to see a little bit more,02:20:35.600,2.0
of that in this pandemic,02:20:37.600,2.24
it's an opportunity for the best,02:20:39.840,2.88
of our nature to shine it's so i've seen,02:20:42.720,2.4
some of the worst,02:20:45.120,1.92
um but i think some of that is just good,02:20:47.040,2.0
therapy and uh i'm hoping in the end,02:20:49.040,3.2
what we have here is uh is love at the,02:20:52.240,2.88
very least,02:20:55.120,1.199
