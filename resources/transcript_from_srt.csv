the following is a conversation with jay,0.0,1.76
baracaria professor of medicine health,1.76,2.88
policy and economics at stanford,4.64,2.0
university,6.64,1.52
please allow me to say a few words about,8.16,2.24
lockdowns and the blinding destructive,10.4,2.64
effects of arrogance on leadership,13.04,2.479
especially in the space of policy and,15.519,2.561
politics,18.08,1.6
jay barakaria is the co-author of the,19.68,2.24
now famous great barrington declaration,21.92,2.4
a one-page document that in october 2020,24.32,3.44
made a case against the effectiveness of,27.76,2.4
lockdowns,30.16,1.76
most of this podcast conversation is,31.92,1.68
about the ideas related to this document,33.6,2.639
and so let me say a few things here,36.239,2.64
about what troubles me,38.879,2.561
those who advocate for lockdowns as a,41.44,2.08
policy,43.52,0.879
often ignore the quiet suffering of,44.399,1.921
millions that it results in which,46.32,2.239
includes economic pain loss of jobs that,48.559,2.721
give meaning and pride in the face of,51.28,1.759
uncertainty the increase in suicide and,53.039,2.721
suicidal ideation and in general the,55.76,2.88
fear and anger that arises from the,58.64,2.48
powerlessness forced onto the populace,61.12,2.88
but the self-proclaimed elites and,64.0,2.159
experts,66.159,1.841
many folks whose job is unaffected by,68.0,2.479
the lockdowns talk down to the masses,70.479,2.241
about which path forward is right and,72.72,2.16
which is wrong,74.88,1.52
what troubles me most,76.4,1.759
is this very lack of empathy among the,78.15899999999999,2.081
policymakers for the common man,80.24,2.559
and in general for people unlike,82.799,1.841
themselves the landscape of suffering is,84.64,2.88
vast and must be fully considered in,87.52,2.8
calculating the response to the pandemic,90.32,2.72
with humility and with rigorous,93.03999999999999,3.2
open-minded scientific debate,96.24000000000001,2.96
jay and i talk about the email from,99.2,1.919
francis collins to anthony fauci that,101.119,2.401
called jay and his two co-authors,103.52000000000001,2.879
fringe epidemiologists and also called,106.399,3.04
for a devastating published takedown of,109.439,2.081
their ideas,111.52000000000001,1.599
these words from francis,113.119,2.081
broke my heart,115.2,1.76
i understand them i can even steel man,116.96000000000001,2.56
them,119.52000000000001,1.04
but nevertheless on balance they show to,120.56,3.12
me a failure of leadership,123.68,2.88
leadership in a pandemic is hard,126.56,2.318
which is why great leaders are,128.878,1.682
remembered by history,130.56,2.0
they are rare they stand out,132.56,3.28
and they give me hope,135.84,2.56
also this whole mess,138.4,2.4
inspires me on my small individual level,140.8,2.0
to do the right thing,142.8,1.76
in the face of conformity,144.56,2.08
despite the long odds,146.64,2.72
i talked to francis collins i talked to,149.36,2.4
albert burleigh pfizer ceo,151.76,2.24
i also talked and will continue to talk,154.0,2.4
with people like jay,156.4,1.44
and other dissenting voices that,157.84,2.0
challenge the mainstream narratives and,159.84,2.24
those in the seats of power,162.07999999999998,2.56
i hope to highlight both the strengths,164.64,2.0
and weaknesses in their ideas with,166.64,2.56
respect and empathy but also with guts,169.2,2.96
and skill,172.16,1.68
the skill part i hope to improve on over,173.84,2.56
time,176.4,1.28
and i do believe that conversation,177.68,2.96
and an open mind is the way out of this,180.64,3.599
and finally as i've said in the past i,184.239,2.72
value love,186.959,1.36
and integrity far far above money fame,188.319,3.28
and power,191.599,1.201
those latter three are all ephemeral,192.8,3.04
they slip through the fingers of anyone,195.84,1.84
who tries to hold on,197.68,2.08
and leave behind an empty shell of a,199.76,2.559
human being,202.319,1.84
i prefer to die a man who lived by,204.159,2.321
principles that nobody could shake and a,206.48,2.399
man who added a bit of love to the world,208.879,3.761
this is the lex friedman podcast to,212.64,2.239
support it please check out our sponsors,214.879,2.321
in the description and now here's my,217.2,2.0
conversation with jay batakaria,219.2,4.56
to our best understanding today how,223.76,2.72
deadly is coveted,226.48,1.839
do we have a good measure,228.31900000000002,2.0
for for this very question,230.31900000000002,2.241
so the the best evidence for covet the,232.56,2.56
deadline to covet comes from a whole,235.12,2.24
series of zero prevalent studies sierra,237.36,2.799
preference studies are these studies of,240.159,2.16
antibody prevalence in the population at,242.319,1.84
large,244.159,1.44
i was,245.599,0.961
part of the you know the very first set,246.56,1.44
of sierra problem studies one in santa,248.0,1.36
clara county one in l.a county and one,249.36,1.68
in the with major league baseball around,251.04,1.68
the u.s uh if i may just pause you for a,252.72,2.719
second,255.439,1.601
if people don't know what uh serology is,257.04,2.08
in cerro prevalence it does sound like,259.12,2.238
you say zero prevalence it's not it's,261.358,2.162
cerro and serology's antibodies so it's,263.52,2.959
it's a a survey that counts the number,266.479,2.0
of antibodies specifically,268.479,2.561
people that have antibodies,271.04,2.4
specific to kovaid which perhaps shows,273.44,2.8
an indication that they likely have had,276.24,2.399
cobit and therefore this is a way to,278.639,2.161
study how many people in the population,280.8,2.24
have been exposed to have had,283.04,2.4
exactly yeah exactly so the idea is that,285.44,2.72
uh,288.15999999999997,2.16
we don't know,290.32,1.439
exactly the number of people with cove,291.759,1.681
just by counting the people that are,293.44,1.68
there to present themselves with,295.12,1.359
symptoms of covid um covet has it turns,296.479,2.241
out a very wide range of symptoms,298.72,1.919
possible ranging from no symptoms at all,300.639,3.441
to this deadly viral pneumonia that's,304.08,1.92
killed so many people and the problem is,306.0,2.24
like in if you just count the number of,308.24,1.679
cases the people who have very few,309.919,1.201
symptoms so often don't show up for,311.12,2.72
testing we just don't they're outside of,313.84,1.68
the can of of public health,315.52,2.48
and so it's really hard to know that the,318.0,2.8
answer to your question without,320.8,1.44
understanding how many people are,322.24,1.28
infected because you you can probably,323.52,1.76
tell the number of deaths that's even,325.28,1.199
though there's some controversy over,326.479,1.201
that but uh that so that the numerators,327.68,2.72
is possible but the denominator is much,330.4,1.84
harder how much controversy is there,332.24,2.08
about the death we're gonna go on,334.32,1.52
million tangents is that okay we're,335.84000000000003,2.72
gonna i have a million questions so one,338.56,2.88
i love data so much,341.44,2.0
but i've like almost tuned out paying,343.44,2.24
attention to cover data because i feel,345.68,2.079
like i'm walking on shaky ground i don't,347.759,2.481
know who to trust,350.24,1.36
um maybe you can comment on different,351.6,1.84
sources of data different kinds of data,353.44,2.56
the death one that seems like a really,356.0,1.919
important one,357.919,1.201
can we trust the reported deaths,359.12,2.88
associated with covid or is it just a,362.0,1.919
giant messy thing that mixed up and then,363.919,2.321
there's this kind of stories about,366.24,2.16
hospitals being incentivized,368.4,3.04
uh to report a death as covert death so,371.44,3.039
uh uh there's some truth in some of that,374.479,1.84
let me just so,376.319,1.44
let me just talk about the incentive so,377.759,1.681
in the united states,379.44,2.0
we passed this cares act that was aimed,381.44,2.879
at,384.319,0.72
making sure hospital assistance didn't,385.039,1.44
go bankrupt in the early days the,386.479,1.681
pandemic,388.16,1.2
the couple things they did one was they,389.36,2.0
provided incentives to treat covet,391.36,2.24
patients,393.6,0.96
tens of thousands of dollars extra per,394.56,2.32
per covered patient,396.88,1.759
um and the other thing they did is they,398.639,1.601
they gave a 20 bump to medicare payments,400.24,2.16
for elderly patients who are treated,402.4,1.44
with covet the idea is that there's more,403.84000000000003,1.6
expensive to treat them i guess the,405.44,1.28
early days um so that did provide an,406.72,2.319
incentive to sort of have have a lot of,409.039,2.0
code patients in the hospital because,411.039,2.0
your financial,413.039,1.6
success of the hospital or at least not,414.639,1.761
by the lack of financial ruin depended,416.4,1.84
on having many covered patients the,418.24,2.32
other thing on the death certificates is,420.56,1.68
that reporting of deaths is a separate,422.24,1.44
issue i don't know that there's a,423.68,1.04
financial incentive there but there is,424.72,2.08
this sort of like complicated you know,426.8,2.08
when you fill out a death certificate,428.88,2.24
for a patient with a lot of conditions,431.12,2.4
uh like let's say a patient has diabetes,433.52,1.76
a patient that well that diabetes could,435.28,2.0
lead to,437.28,1.84
heart failure you know you have a heart,439.12,1.359
attack heart failure your lungs fill up,440.479,2.641
then you get covered and,443.12,2.4
what and you die so what do you what do,445.52,1.44
you write on the death certificate was,446.96,1.2
it cause it covered the killed you was,448.16,1.439
it the lungs filling up was it the the,449.599,2.32
heart heart failure was it the diabetes,451.919,2.0
it's really difficult to like,453.919,1.68
disentangle,455.599,1.361
um and i think a lot of a lot of times,456.96,2.56
what's happened is they people have like,459.52,2.0
erred on the side of signing is covet,461.52,3.119
now what's the evidence of this there's,464.639,1.521
been a couple of,466.15999999999997,1.439
of audits of death certificates in,467.599,2.0
places like santa clara county where i,469.599,1.6
live in alameda county,471.199,1.921
uh california where they they carefully,473.12,2.4
went through the death certificate said,475.52,1.04
okay is this reasonable to say this was,476.56,1.6
actually covered or is it was covered,478.15999999999997,1.599
incidental and they found that about 25,479.759,2.641
20 25 of the deaths were,482.4,2.239
more likely incidental than directly due,484.639,2.321
to covet,486.96,1.28
i i personally don't get too excited,488.24,1.679
about this i mean it's a philosophical,489.919,1.68
question right like ultimately,491.599,2.32
what kills you,493.919,1.68
it's which is an odd thing to say if you,495.599,1.841
if you're if you're not you're not in,497.44,1.439
medicine but like really it's it's a,498.879,2.481
it's almost always multifactorial it's,501.36,1.92
always always just the bus hits you the,503.28,1.84
bus hits you that you get a brain bleed,505.12,1.919
was the brain bleed that killed you,507.039,1.44
would it burst anyway i mean you know,508.479,2.0
the bus hits you killed you right the,510.479,1.92
way you die is a philosophical question,512.399,1.601
but it's also a sociological and,514.0,1.679
psychological question because it seems,515.679,1.681
like,517.36,1.199
every single person who's passed away,518.559,2.801
over the past couple of years kind of,521.36,1.919
the first question that comes to mind is,523.279,1.68
just was it not not just because you're,524.9590000000001,2.401
trying to be political but just in your,527.36,1.52
mind no i think there's a psychological,528.88,2.16
reason for this right so um,531.04,2.16
you know we have we spent uh the better,533.2,1.92
part of a at least a half century in the,535.12,1.92
united states not worried too much,537.04,2.32
about infectious diseases and we the,539.36,2.32
notion was we'd essentially conquered,541.68,1.52
them it was something that happens in,543.2,1.6
faraway places to other people,544.8,2.88
and that's true for much of the,547.68,1.12
developed world life expectancies were,548.8,1.92
going up,550.72,0.96
for you know decades and decades,551.68,2.159
and for the first time in living memory,553.839,2.161
we have a disease that can kill us,556.0,2.16
i mean i think we're effectively evolved,558.16,2.08
to fear that like the the panic centers,560.24,2.48
of our brain the lizard part of our,562.72,1.36
brain takes over,564.08,1.759
and our central focus has been avoiding,565.8389999999999,2.321
this one risk,568.16,1.6
um and so it's not surprising that but,569.76,2.24
people when they're filling out death,572.0,1.279
certificates or thinking about what what,573.279,2.081
led to the death,575.36,1.12
this most salient thing that's in the,576.48,2.16
front of everyone's brain would jump to,578.64,1.84
the top,580.48,1.76
and we can't ignore,582.24,2.0
this very deep psychological thing when,584.24,2.719
we consider,586.9590000000001,2.161
what people say on the internet what,589.12,1.92
people say to each other what people,591.04,1.6
write in scientific papers what,592.64,1.92
everything it feels like,594.56,2.8
when covid,597.36,1.76
has been,599.12,1.44
um,600.56,1.76
has been brought onto this world,602.32,2.72
everything changed in the way people,605.04,2.799
feel about each other just the way they,607.839,2.161
communicate with each other i think,610.0,2.72
the the level of emotion involved,612.72,2.96
i think it in many people it brought out,615.68,2.399
the worst in them,618.079,2.401
for sometimes short periods of time and,620.48,1.68
sometimes it was always therapeutic like,622.16,2.0
you were waiting to get out like the,624.16,1.6
darkest parts of you,625.76,1.84
just to say if you're angry at something,627.6,1.919
in this world i'm going to say it now,629.519,2.081
and um i think that's probably talking,631.6,2.32
to some deep primal thing that,633.92,2.64
um,636.56,0.959
fear we have for um,637.519,2.56
formalities of all different kinds and,640.079,1.76
then when that fear is aroused and all,641.8389999999999,2.401
the deepest emotions it's like a,644.24,2.64
freudian,646.88,1.199
uh psychotherapy session but across the,648.079,2.481
world something that uh psychologists,650.56,2.32
are gonna have a field day with for,652.88,1.6
generation trying to understand um i,654.48,1.84
mean i think that,656.32,1.44
i mean what you say is right but piled,657.76,1.759
on top of that is also this sort of,659.519,4.32
uh this impetus to empathy to empathize,663.839,2.801
compassion toward others,666.64,1.92
essentially militarized,668.56,2.399
right so i'm protecting you by by some,670.959,4.32
actions,675.279,1.12
and,676.399,1.041
uh those actions if i if i don't do them,677.44,2.72
if you don't do them well that months,680.16,1.28
must mean you don't just you you hate me,681.44,2.48
um it's created this like social tension,683.92,2.32
that i've never seen before and we and,686.24,1.68
we start have started we started we,687.92,2.159
looked at each other as if we were just,690.079,1.76
simply,691.8389999999999,1.281
sources of of germs,693.12,2.48
rather than people to get to know,695.6,2.16
people to enjoy people to get you know,697.76,1.68
to learn from um it it colored,699.44,3.68
basically almost every human interaction,703.12,1.52
for every every human on the planet,704.64,2.48
yeah the basic common humanity it's like,707.12,2.719
you can wear a mask you can stand far,709.8389999999999,1.841
away,711.68,0.88
but the,712.56,0.959
love you have for each other when you,713.519,1.281
look into each other's eyes that was,714.8,1.92
dissipating and,716.72,1.679
by region too i've experienced having,718.399,2.641
traveled quite a bit throughout this,721.04,1.919
time,722.959,1.201
it um it was really sad even people that,724.16,2.64
are really close together just the way,726.8,1.92
they stood the way they looked at each,728.72,1.919
other,730.639,0.801
and i it made me feel for a moment,731.44,3.12
um,734.56,0.8
that the fabric that connects all of us,735.36,1.919
is more fragile than i thought,737.279,2.481
i mean if you walk down the street or if,739.76,1.519
you ever if you did this during covet,741.279,1.841
i'm sure you had this experience where,743.12,1.36
you walk down the street if you're not,744.48,1.12
wearing a mask or even if you are,745.6,2.0
people will jump off the off the,747.6,1.84
sidewalk as you walk past them,749.44,2.32
as if your poison,751.76,2.96
even though the data are that covet,754.72,2.08
spreads you know indifferently outdoors,756.8,2.08
or if at all really at outdoors,758.88,2.48
but it's not simply a biological or,761.36,2.64
infectious disease phenomenon or,764.0,1.44
immunological it's it is a it is a it's,765.44,1.92
a,767.36,0.64
it is a change in the way humans treated,768.0,2.24
each other i hope hope temporary,770.24,2.399
i do want to say on the flip side of,772.639,1.76
that so i was,774.399,1.521
mostly in boston massachusetts when the,775.92,2.4
pandemic broke out i think that's where,778.32,1.68
i was yeah,780.0,1.279
and then i got came here to austin texas,781.279,2.961
to visit my now good friend joe rogan,784.24,3.36
and he was the first person,787.6,2.32
without pause this wasn't a political,789.92,1.919
statement this was anything just walk,791.839,2.081
toward me and give me a big hug,793.92,2.479
and say it's great to see you and i,796.399,2.161
can't tell you how great it felt because,798.56,2.0
i in that moment realized the absence of,800.56,2.16
that connection back in boston over just,802.72,1.84
a couple of over a couple of months and,804.56,2.399
um,806.959,1.281
it's we'll talk about it more but it's,808.24,2.64
tragic to think about,810.88,2.0
that distancing that dissolution of,812.88,2.32
common humanity at scale what what kind,815.2,2.16
of impact it has on society just,817.36,2.8
across the board political division,820.16,2.479
uh and just in the quiet of your own,822.639,2.241
mind in the privacy of your own home the,824.88,1.92
depression the sadness the loneliness,826.8,2.24
that leads to suicide,829.04,2.0
and forget suicide just,831.04,2.799
low key suffering yeah no i think that's,833.8389999999999,3.041
that's the suffering that isolation,836.88,2.399
we're not meant to live alone we're not,839.279,1.841
meant to live apart from one another,841.12,1.279
that's of course the ideology of,842.399,1.44
lockdown is to make people live apart,843.839,2.721
alone isolated so that we don't spread,846.56,1.92
diseases to each other right,848.48,1.68
but we're not actually designed as a,850.16,1.6
species to live that way,851.76,2.24
and that uh what you're describing i,854.0,1.68
think,855.68,0.8
if everyone's honest with themselves,856.48,1.52
have felt uh especially in places where,858.0,2.24
that where lockdowns have been sort of,860.24,1.92
very militantly enforced has felt deep,862.16,2.64
into their core,864.8,1.44
well i if i could just return to the,866.24,1.68
question of deaths he said that the data,867.92,2.88
isn't perfect because we need these kind,870.8,2.32
of serial prevalence surveys to,873.12,2.399
understand how many cases there were to,875.519,2.401
determine the rate of deaths,877.92,1.919
and we need to have a strong footing in,879.8389999999999,2.24
the number of deaths but if we assume,882.079,1.521
that the the,883.6,1.28
the number of deaths is approximately,884.88,1.6
correct,886.48,0.96
like what's your sense what kind of,887.44,2.16
statements,889.6,1.359
can we say about the deadliness of covet,890.9590000000001,2.161
against,893.12,0.88
across different demographics maybe not,894.0,2.88
in a political way or in the current way,896.88,1.84
but when history looks back,898.72,2.4
at this moment of time,901.12,2.159
50 years from now 100 years from now the,903.279,1.92
way we look at the,905.199,1.841
pandemic 100 years ago,907.04,2.56
what will they say about the deadliness,909.6,1.76
of code i mean i think the deadlines of,911.36,2.4
kova depends on not just the virus,913.76,2.16
itself but who who it infects,915.92,2.24
um so the probably the most important,918.16,1.44
thing about it about the deadlines of,919.6,1.44
covet is is this steep age gradient in,921.04,3.359
the mortality rate um so according to,924.399,2.8
these zero prevalence studies that that,927.199,2.32
that have been done now hundreds of them,929.519,2.401
um,931.92,0.88
mostly from before vaccination because,932.8,1.599
vaccination also reduces the mortality,934.399,1.68
risk of covid um the the sierra,936.079,2.161
prevalent studies suggest that,938.24,2.719
the risk of of death if you're say over,940.9590000000001,2.161
the age of 70,943.12,1.6
is,944.72,1.2
very high if you have five percent,945.92,2.8
if you get covered,948.72,1.76
if you're if you're under the age of 70,950.48,1.68
it's lower,952.16,1.119
0.05 but there's not a single sharp cut,953.279,2.721
off it's more like i have a rule of,956.0,1.839
thumb that i use um so if you're 50,957.8389999999999,3.44
say the infection fatality rate from,961.279,2.161
covalent is 0.2,963.44,1.519
according to the zero prevalence data,964.959,2.401
that means 99.8 survival,967.36,2.8
if you're 50 and for every seven years,970.16,2.32
of age above that double it every seven,972.48,2.56
years of age below that have it,975.04,2.88
so 57 year old have a 0.4,977.92,2.88
mortality a 64 year old would have a,980.8,2.0
point eight percent and so on and uh if,982.8,2.32
you have a severe chronic disease like,985.12,1.76
diabetes or if you're more morbidly,986.88,1.84
obese it's like adding seven seven years,988.72,2.239
to your life,990.959,1.361
and this is uh for unvaccinated folks,992.32,2.639
this is unvaccinated uh in the before,994.9590000000001,2.641
delta also,997.6,1.359
are there a lot of people that will be,998.9590000000001,1.44
listening to this with phds at the end,1000.399,2.481
of their name that would disagree with,1002.88,2.16
the 99.8 would you say so i think,1005.04,2.719
there's some disagreement over this uh,1007.759,2.08
and the disagreement,1009.8389999999999,1.601
is about the quality of the zero,1011.44,1.839
prevalence studies that were conducted,1013.279,2.8
so as i said earlier i was the senior,1016.079,2.081
investigator in three different sierra,1018.16,1.76
problem studies and very early in the,1019.92,1.2
epidemic,1021.12,1.76
i view them as very high quality studies,1022.88,2.4
um we we um in santa clara county what,1025.28,2.88
we did is we used a a test kit,1028.16,3.039
uh to uh that we obtained,1031.199,2.88
from uh someone who was works in major,1034.079,2.401
league baseball actually he ordered,1036.48,2.16
these test kits very early in march 2020,1038.64,2.64
that measures very accurately measures,1041.28,2.799
antibody levels,1044.079,1.76
antibodies in the in in the bloodstream,1045.839,2.401
uh these test kits were eventually were,1048.24,1.76
approved by the the head of eua by the,1050.0,2.88
emergency use authorization by the fda,1052.88,2.96
sort of shortly after we did this,1055.84,1.839
and uh it had a very low false positive,1057.679,2.161
rate false plot of means if you if you,1059.84,2.24
uh if you don't have these coveted,1062.08,2.08
antibodies in your bloodstream the cut,1064.16,2.16
kit shows up positive anyways that that,1066.32,2.0
turns out to happen about point five,1068.32,2.0
percent of the time,1070.32,1.44
um and uh based on studies a very large,1071.76,3.52
number of studies looking at,1075.28,1.68
blood from 2018 you try it against this,1076.96,2.32
kit,1079.28,1.2
and uh you know point five percent of,1080.48,1.76
the time 2018 there shouldn't be any,1082.24,1.6
bodies there so for to cover if it turns,1083.84,2.4
positive as a false positive 0.5 of the,1086.24,2.0
time,1088.24,1.36
um and then you know like a false,1089.6,1.68
negative rate about 10,1091.28,2.48
12 something like that i don't remember,1093.76,1.84
the exact number but the false positive,1095.6,2.079
rate is the important thing there right,1097.679,1.12
so you have a population in march 2020,1098.799,2.641
or april 2020 with very low,1101.44,2.32
fraction of patients having been exposed,1103.76,2.32
to code you don't know how much but low,1106.08,2.64
even a small false positive rate could,1108.72,1.839
end up,1110.559,1.36
biasing your study quite a bit,1111.919,2.321
but there's a formula to adjust for that,1114.24,1.679
you can adjust for the fourth spot rate,1115.919,1.441
falls negative rate we did we did that,1117.36,1.6
adjustment and those studies found in a,1118.96,3.28
community population so leaving aside,1122.24,1.84
people in nursing homes who have a,1124.08,1.28
higher death rate from covid um the that,1125.36,3.12
the death rate was point two percent in,1128.48,2.0
santa clara county,1130.48,1.52
and in l.a county across all these,1132.0,2.48
groups in the community community,1134.48,2.0
meaning just like regular yeah so like,1136.48,2.079
that that's actually a real important,1138.559,1.041
question too so uh the santa clara study,1139.6,2.48
we did this facebook sampling scheme,1142.08,3.12
um which is i mean not not the ideal,1145.2,2.479
thing but just like it was very,1147.679,1.201
difficult to get a random sample on and,1148.88,2.32
during the you know during lockdown,1151.2,2.479
um where we put out uh an ad on facebook,1153.679,3.281
soliciting people to,1156.96,1.52
volunteer for the study a randomly,1158.48,1.84
selected set of people we were hoping to,1160.32,2.32
get a random selection of people from,1162.64,1.44
santa clara county but it tended to the,1164.08,2.24
people who tend to volunteer were from,1166.32,1.44
the richer parts of the county like i,1167.76,1.52
had,1169.28,0.72
stanford professors writing begging to,1170.0,1.52
be in the study because they wanted,1171.52,1.36
antibody levels so we did some,1172.88,2.32
adjustment for that in la county we,1175.2,2.08
hired a firm that had a pre-existing,1177.28,3.36
representative sample of la county,1180.64,2.32
um,1182.96,0.88
so but it didn't include nursing homes,1183.84,2.0
it didn't include people in jail things,1185.84,1.839
like that didn't include the homeless,1187.679,1.12
populations so it's it's representative,1188.799,2.24
of a community dwelling population,1191.039,2.721
both of those and there we found that,1193.76,3.12
both in l.a county and santa clara,1196.88,1.6
county in april 2020 something like 40,1198.48,3.04
to 50 times more infections than cases,1201.52,3.6
in both places,1205.12,1.52
so for every case that had been reported,1206.64,2.399
to the public health authorities we,1209.039,1.921
found that you know you know 40 or 50,1210.96,3.28
other infections people with antibodies,1214.24,2.4
in their blood,1216.64,1.12
that suggested that they'd had coveted,1217.76,1.76
recovered so people were not reporting,1219.52,1.92
or severe at least in those days under,1221.44,2.64
reporting yeah i mean there was you know,1224.08,1.839
there's testing problems there weren't,1225.919,1.441
so many tests available people didn't,1227.36,2.4
know a lot of a lot of them we asked a,1229.76,2.159
set of questions about the symptoms,1231.919,1.361
they've faced,1233.28,1.36
and most of them said they faced no,1234.64,1.2
symptoms or the most uh 30 40 of them,1235.84,2.16
said face their no symptoms,1238.0,2.64
and i mean even these days how many,1240.64,1.76
people report that they get covered when,1242.4,1.84
they get covered okay i'll have those,1244.24,2.08
numbers,1246.32,1.12
that point two percent has that,1247.44,2.32
approximately held up over time that is,1249.76,1.84
so if professor john ian edis who's a,1251.6,2.16
colleague of mine at stanford uh is a,1253.76,1.84
world expert in meta analysis probably,1255.6,1.36
the most cited scientist on earth i,1256.96,2.0
think uh at least living,1258.96,2.32
he he did a a meta-analysis of now a,1261.28,2.24
hundred or more of these cereal,1263.52,1.76
prevalence studies,1265.28,2.08
um and uh uh what he found was that that,1267.36,3.199
point two percent is roughly the,1270.559,1.921
worldwide number in fact i think he,1272.48,2.0
cites this lower number 0.15 percent,1274.48,2.8
as the median infection fatality rate,1277.28,2.08
worldwide,1279.36,1.199
so we did these studies and it generated,1280.559,2.24
an enormous amount of blowback,1282.799,2.321
by people who thought that the infection,1285.12,1.76
rate is much higher,1286.88,1.44
and there's some controversy over the,1288.32,1.599
quality of some of the other studies,1289.919,1.521
that that are done and so there are some,1291.44,1.84
people who look at this same literature,1293.28,2.16
and say well the the lower quality,1295.44,2.0
studies tend to have lower ifrs,1297.44,2.16
the higher quality studies how far oh,1299.6,1.76
infection fatality right i apologize i,1301.36,2.0
do this in lectures too,1303.36,2.319
and i'm going to rudely interrupt you,1305.679,2.88
and ask for uh for the basics sometimes,1308.559,2.48
if it's okay no of course so these these,1311.039,2.241
higher quality studies they say are tend,1313.28,2.24
to produce higher but the problem is,1315.52,1.84
that if you want a global eye infection,1317.36,2.72
fatality rate you need to get,1320.08,2.56
sierra problem studies from everywhere,1322.64,1.76
even places that don't necessarily have,1324.4,1.6
the infrastructure set up to produce,1326.0,1.44
very very high quality studies,1327.44,2.08
and in poor places in the world,1329.52,3.12
this the the st that uh like places like,1332.64,2.56
africa the infection fatality rate is,1335.2,1.76
incredibly low,1336.96,2.64
uh and in some richer places,1339.6,2.8
like new york city the infection,1342.4,1.36
fatality rate is is much higher,1343.76,2.88
it's there's a range of ifrs not a,1346.64,2.399
single number,1349.039,1.681
this sometimes surprises people because,1350.72,2.0
they think well it's a it's a virus it,1352.72,1.439
should have the same properties no,1354.159,1.121
matter where it goes,1355.28,1.36
but the virus,1356.64,2.72
kills or infects or hurts in interaction,1359.36,3.6
with the host,1362.96,1.68
and the properties of both the host and,1364.64,2.0
the virus,1366.64,1.12
combine to produce the the outcome but,1367.76,2.56
you also mentioned the environment too,1370.32,2.56
well it's i'm thinking mainly just about,1372.88,1.84
the the person like if i'm gonna think,1374.72,1.6
about it like the most simplest way to,1376.32,1.359
think about it is age age is the single,1377.679,1.761
most important risk factor,1379.44,1.76
so older places are going to have a,1381.2,2.32
higher ifr,1383.52,2.399
than younger places africa three percent,1385.919,2.161
of africa is over 65. so in some sense,1388.08,2.88
it's not surprising that they have a low,1390.96,3.199
infection fatality rate so that's one,1394.159,1.841
way you would explain the difference,1396.0,1.2
between africa and new york city in,1397.2,1.76
terms of the fatality rate is the age,1398.96,2.16
the average age yeah and especially in,1401.12,2.0
the early days of the epidemic in new,1403.12,2.4
york city,1405.52,1.279
the,1406.799,0.88
uh,1407.679,0.801
older populations living in nursing,1408.48,2.24
homes were differentially infected,1410.72,2.56
based on because of policies that were,1413.28,1.68
adopted right to send,1414.96,2.0
coveted infected patients back to,1416.96,1.36
nursing homes to keep hospitals empty,1418.32,1.839
what do you mean by differentially,1420.159,1.52
infected,1421.679,1.12
the policy that you adopt determines who,1422.799,3.201
is most exposed right that okay so,1426.0,2.48
that's what the policy it's the person,1428.48,2.88
that matters,1431.36,1.28
i mean it's not like the virus just kind,1432.64,2.08
of it doesn't care i mean the policy,1434.72,2.48
determines the nature of the interaction,1437.2,2.0
and there's also i mean there is some,1439.2,1.68
contribution from the,1440.88,1.96
environment different regions have,1442.84,2.12
different proximity maybe of people,1444.96,2.56
interacting or the dynamics of the way,1447.52,1.759
they interact,1449.279,1.441
like if you have a if you have,1450.72,1.36
situations where there's lots of,1452.08,1.28
intergenerational,1453.36,1.76
uh interactions yeah then you have a,1455.12,2.64
very different risk profile than if than,1457.76,2.24
if you have societies that are where,1460.0,2.24
generations are more separate from one,1462.24,1.439
another,1463.679,0.961
um,1464.64,1.039
okay so let me just finish real fast,1465.679,1.521
about this so you you have in new york,1467.2,3.04
you have a population that was infected,1470.24,3.12
in the early days that was,1473.36,1.6
very likely going to die but had a much,1474.96,2.56
higher likelihood of dying if infected,1477.52,2.48
and so new york city had a higher ifr,1480.0,3.039
especially in the early days than um,1483.039,2.321
than um then like africa has had,1485.36,3.439
um the other thing is treatment right so,1488.799,2.641
the treatments that we adopted in the,1491.44,1.52
early days the epidemic i think actually,1492.96,1.599
may have exacerbated the risk of death,1494.559,3.841
which do so like,1498.4,1.6
using ventilators like the the over,1500.0,2.0
reliance on ventilators is what i'm,1502.0,1.679
primarily thinking of but i can think of,1503.679,1.281
other things,1504.96,1.04
um but that that uh also we've learned,1506.0,2.96
over time how better to manage patients,1508.96,2.24
with the disease,1511.2,1.44
so you have those you have all those,1512.64,1.279
things combined so that's that's where,1513.919,1.921
the controversy over this over this,1515.84,1.52
number is i mean,1517.36,1.76
new york city,1519.12,1.76
also it has a is a central hub for those,1520.88,3.279
who tweet,1524.159,1.52
and uh those who write powerful stories,1525.679,3.36
and narratives in article form,1529.039,2.64
and i remember those quite dramatic,1531.679,2.401
stories about sort of doctors in the,1534.08,1.76
hospitals and these kinds of things i,1535.84,1.52
mean there's very serious very dramatic,1537.36,3.12
very tragic deaths going on always in,1540.48,3.28
hospitals those stories,1543.76,2.96
um,1546.72,1.04
a lot of loved ones losing each other on,1547.76,2.399
a deathbed that's always tragic and you,1550.159,2.241
can always write a hell of a good story,1552.4,2.159
about that and you should about the loss,1554.559,2.48
of loved ones but they were doing it,1557.039,2.321
pretty pretty well i would say um over,1559.36,2.64
this kind of dramatic deaths and so in,1562.0,2.72
response to that it's very,1564.72,2.8
unpleasant to hear even to consider the,1567.52,2.639
possibility that,1570.159,1.76
the death rate is not as high as you,1571.919,3.041
might otherwise as you might feel yeah i,1574.96,3.199
was surprised by the reaction,1578.159,2.321
both by regular people and also the,1580.48,2.24
scientific community in response to,1582.72,2.0
those studies those early studies in,1584.72,1.76
april of 2020 um uh to me they uh they,1586.48,3.6
were there were studies i mean they're,1590.08,2.0
they're the kinds of not exactly the,1592.08,2.079
kinds of work i've worked on all my life,1594.159,1.281
but it's kind of kind of like the kind,1595.44,1.76
of you know like you you write a paper,1597.2,2.4
and you get response responses from your,1599.6,2.319
fellow scientists and you you know,1601.919,1.681
change the paper to improve it uh you,1603.6,1.439
have hopefully learned something from it,1605.039,2.081
well but to push back it's just a study,1607.12,3.2
but there's some studies and this is,1610.32,1.76
kind of interesting because i've,1612.08,2.079
received similar pushback on other,1614.159,2.241
topics,1616.4,2.48
there's,1619.36,1.04
some studies that,1620.4,2.08
if,1622.48,1.04
wrong might have a wide ranging uh,1623.52,4.24
detrimental effects on society so that's,1627.76,2.24
that that's the way they would perceive,1630.0,1.36
the studies if you say the death rate is,1631.36,1.76
lower and you end up as you often do in,1633.12,2.88
science realizing that nope that that,1636.0,2.08
was there was a flaw in the way the,1638.08,2.0
study was conducted or were just not,1640.08,1.92
representative of a broader population,1642.0,1.919
and then you realize the death rate is,1643.919,1.441
much higher that might be very damaging,1645.36,2.24
in in people's view uh so so that's,1647.6,2.88
probably,1650.48,1.199
where the scientific community sort of,1651.679,2.161
just steal man the kind of response is,1653.84,3.439
that's where they felt like you know,1657.279,2.64
there's some findings where you better,1659.919,2.0
be damn sure before you kind of report,1661.919,2.961
them,1664.88,0.799
yeah i mean we were pretty sure we were,1665.679,1.36
right and it turns out we were right so,1667.039,1.441
like when we so um,1668.48,2.319
we released the the santa clara study,1670.799,3.36
via this open open science process and,1674.159,2.64
this uh server called med med archive,1676.799,2.321
it's it's designed for releasing studies,1679.12,2.96
have not yet been pre-reviewed in order,1682.08,2.0
to garner comment from the from,1684.08,1.839
scientists before peer review,1685.919,2.561
the the la county study we went through,1688.48,1.679
the traditional peer review process,1690.159,2.081
and got it published in the journal of,1692.24,1.36
american medical association sometime in,1693.6,1.52
like uh july i think forget the date of,1695.12,2.559
2020.,1697.679,1.281
the santa clara study released in april,1698.96,1.92
of 2020 in this you know sort of working,1700.88,2.32
paper archive,1703.2,1.839
the the reason was that we felt we had,1705.039,1.921
an obligation we had a result that was,1706.96,2.959
we thought was quite important,1709.919,1.841
and we wanted to tell the scientific,1711.76,2.32
community about it and also tell the,1714.08,1.44
world about it,1715.52,1.12
and it wasn't we wanted to get feedback,1716.64,1.36
i mean that's part of the purpose of,1718.0,1.84
sending it to these kinds of places,1719.84,2.319
i think a lot of the problem is that,1722.159,2.88
uh when people think about published,1725.039,1.921
science they think of it as,1726.96,1.68
automatically true and if it goes,1728.64,2.159
through peer review it's automatically,1730.799,1.201
true if it hasn't gone through peer,1732.0,0.96
review it's not automatically true and,1732.96,2.079
especially in medicine when we're not,1735.039,2.401
used to having this at this access to,1737.44,3.04
pre-peer-reviewed,1740.48,2.319
work i mean in economics actually that's,1742.799,1.841
quite normal you it takes years to get,1744.64,2.56
something published so there's a very,1747.2,1.76
active debate over or discussion about,1748.96,2.959
papers before they're peer-reviewed in,1751.919,1.601
this in this sort of working paper way,1753.52,2.32
um much less normal or much much newer,1755.84,2.719
in in medicine,1758.559,1.681
and so i think part of that the,1760.24,1.36
perception about what those that what,1761.6,2.4
process happens in open science when you,1764.0,2.48
release a study,1766.48,1.36
that that got people confused and you're,1767.84,1.68
right it was a very important result,1769.52,1.84
because we had just locked the world,1771.36,1.84
down in middle of march,1773.2,2.8
with i think catastrophic results,1776.0,2.559
and if the if that study was right if,1778.559,1.921
our study was right that meant we'd made,1780.48,2.0
a mistake,1782.48,1.36
and not because the death rate was low,1783.84,1.839
that's actually not the key thing there,1785.679,2.0
the key thing is that we had adopted,1787.679,2.48
these policies these test and trace,1790.159,2.4
policies these policies these lockdown,1792.559,2.24
policies aimed at suppressing the virus,1794.799,3.281
level to close to zero that was,1798.08,2.16
essentially the idea,1800.24,1.52
if we can just get the virus to go away,1801.76,2.799
we won't have to ever worry about it,1804.559,1.201
again,1805.76,1.519
the main problem with our result as far,1807.279,2.241
as that strategy was concerned wasn't,1809.52,1.36
the death rate it was the 40 to 50 times,1810.88,2.32
more infections than cases it was the,1813.2,1.839
two and a half percent or uh three,1815.039,2.0
percent or four percent prevalence rate,1817.039,2.321
that we identified,1819.36,1.76
of the antibodies in the population if,1821.12,1.919
that number is right it's too late the,1823.039,2.721
virus is not going to go to zero,1825.76,2.159
and no matter how much we test and trace,1827.919,1.76
and isolate we're not going to get the,1829.679,1.521
viral level down to zero,1831.2,2.64
so we're going to have to,1833.84,1.68
let the virus go through the entire,1835.52,1.68
population in some way or something,1837.2,1.839
normal well that we can talk about that,1839.039,1.441
in a bit that's the great barrington,1840.48,1.36
declaration you don't have to let the,1841.84,1.199
virus go through the population you can,1843.039,1.441
shield preferentially,1844.48,2.48
the policy we chose was to shield,1846.96,2.079
preferentially the the laptop class,1849.039,2.961
the set of people who could work from,1852.0,1.52
home,1853.52,0.879
without losing their job,1854.399,1.921
yeah and we did a very good job at,1856.32,1.92
protecting them well let me um,1858.24,3.84
take a small tangent we're gonna jump,1862.08,2.479
around in time,1864.559,1.921
which i think will be the best way to,1866.48,1.52
tell the story so that was the beginning,1868.0,2.48
yeah okay actually can i kind of go back,1870.48,2.319
one more thing for that because that's,1872.799,1.281
really important and i should have i,1874.08,1.12
should have started with this,1875.2,1.52
um what led me to do those studies,1876.72,3.6
was a a paper that i had remembered,1880.32,2.4
seeing from the h1n1 flu epidemic in,1882.72,2.88
2009 this is this is where i've been,1885.6,1.84
much less active in writing about that i,1887.44,1.68
had written up like a paper or two about,1889.12,1.76
that when in 2009,1890.88,3.36
there there was actually this same,1894.24,2.159
debate over the mortality rate,1896.399,2.321
except it unfolded over the course of,1898.72,1.839
three years two or three years,1900.559,2.561
the early studies,1903.12,1.679
of the mortality rate,1904.799,1.681
in h1n1 counted the number of cases,1906.48,4.559
in the denominator count the number of,1911.039,1.681
deaths in the numerator cases meaning,1912.72,1.439
people identified as having h1n1 showing,1914.159,2.721
up the doctor,1916.88,1.279
you know tested to have it um and the,1918.159,3.12
early estimates of the h1n1 mortality,1921.279,2.64
were like four percent three percent,1923.919,2.88
really really high,1926.799,2.0
over the course of a couple of more,1928.799,1.681
years a whole bunch of zero prevalence,1930.48,2.0
studies zero prevalence studies of h1n1,1932.48,1.84
flu came out,1934.32,1.359
and it turned out that there were,1935.679,2.561
a hundred or more times of people,1938.24,2.64
infected per case,1940.88,2.24
and so the mortality rate was actually,1943.12,1.6
something like 0.02,1944.72,2.64
for h1n1 not the three three,1947.36,2.96
like a hundredfold difference so this,1950.32,2.0
made you think,1952.32,1.359
okay it took us a couple of two to three,1953.679,2.081
years to discover the truth behind the,1955.76,2.0
actual infections,1957.76,2.159
uh for a h1n1 and then,1959.919,2.88
what's the truth here and can we get,1962.799,1.521
there faster yeah and and there was it,1964.32,2.0
spreads in a similar way as the as the,1966.32,1.76
h1n1 fluid did i mean it's it's spreads,1968.08,1.76
very solidization via you know so,1969.84,2.559
person-to-person breathing kind of kind,1972.399,1.52
of contact up um and maybe maybe some by,1973.919,2.561
by foam eyes but it seems like that's,1976.48,1.439
less likely now in any case it seemed,1977.919,2.64
really important to me to speed up the,1980.559,2.401
process of having those zero prevalence,1982.96,1.76
studies,1984.72,1.04
so that we can better understand who was,1985.76,2.08
at risk,1987.84,1.12
and what the right strategy ought to be,1988.96,3.12
this might be a good place to kind of,1992.08,2.959
compare influenza,1995.039,2.161
the flu and covid in the context of the,1997.2,3.199
discussion we just had which is,2000.399,2.241
how deadly is coved so you mentioned,2002.64,2.399
covet is a very particular kind of,2005.039,1.841
steepness,2006.88,2.32
where the x-axis is age,2009.2,2.88
so,2012.08,1.36
in that context could you maybe compare,2013.44,1.92
influenza and kovid because a lot of,2015.36,2.4
people,2017.76,2.08
outside the folks who suggest that the,2020.399,2.561
the lizards who run the world have,2022.96,2.319
completely fabricated invented kovid,2025.279,3.041
outside of those folks kind of the,2028.32,2.0
natural,2030.32,1.04
process by which you dismiss the threat,2031.36,1.84
of covait to say well it's just like the,2033.2,2.24
flu the flu is a very serious thing,2035.44,1.68
actually um so,2037.12,2.32
in that comparison,2039.44,2.239
where does kovitz stand,2041.679,1.921
yeah the flu is a very serious thing it,2043.6,1.36
kills you know 50 60 000 people a year,2044.96,2.8
something i found that order depending,2047.76,1.28
on the the particular strain that goes,2049.04,1.679
around uh that's in the united states,2050.719,1.92
the primary difference to me are the,2052.639,2.24
there's lots of differences but one of,2054.879,1.2
the most salient differences is the age,2056.079,2.08
gradient and mortality risk for the flu,2058.159,3.2
so the flu is more deadly for two,2061.359,2.72
children than covet is,2064.079,2.481
there's no controversy about that,2066.56,2.799
children thank god,2069.359,2.32
have much less,2071.679,1.841
uh severe,2073.52,1.44
reactions to covet infection to than,2074.96,3.04
that due to flu infections and rate of,2078.0,2.96
fatalities fatality all of that i think,2080.96,2.0
you mentioned um,2082.96,1.679
i mean it's interesting to maybe also,2084.639,1.361
comment on i think in another,2086.0,1.839
conversation mentioned there's a u,2087.839,2.079
shape,2089.918,1.122
to the,2091.04,1.839
to the flu curve,2092.879,1.441
so meaning like there's actually quite a,2094.32,2.0
large number of kids that die from flu,2096.32,2.799
yeah i mean the 1918 flu the h1n1 flew,2099.119,3.201
that the spanish flu in the us killed,2102.32,2.64
millions of of of uh of younger people,2104.96,4.399
and um that is not the case with covid,2109.359,4.081
more than um,2113.44,1.6
i'm going to get the number wrong but,2115.04,1.76
something like 70 80 percent of the,2116.8,2.0
deaths are people over the age of 60.,2118.8,2.799
well we've talked about the fear the,2121.599,1.441
whole time really,2123.04,1.84
but my interaction with folks,2124.88,2.88
now i want to have a family i want to,2127.76,1.44
have kids but i don't have that real,2129.2,2.639
firsthand experience but my interaction,2131.839,1.52
with folks is at the core of fear,2133.359,2.321
that folks had,2135.68,2.159
is for their children,2137.839,2.0
like,2139.839,1.681
that,2141.52,1.36
somehow you know i don't want to get,2142.88,2.16
infected because of the kids like,2145.04,2.72
because god forbid something happens to,2147.76,2.0
the kids and i think,2149.76,2.0
that obviously that makes a lot of sense,2151.76,2.64
this kind of,2154.4,1.04
the kids come first no matter what,2155.44,1.84
that's number one priority but in for,2157.28,2.48
this particular virus,2159.76,2.24
that reasoning was um,2162.0,2.16
not grounded in data it seems like or,2164.16,1.76
that emotion and feeling yeah it was not,2165.92,2.159
grounded it wasn't at the same time this,2168.079,2.481
is way more deadly than the flu just,2170.56,1.84
overall and especially to older people,2172.4,2.959
yes,2175.359,1.041
right so the numbers when when the story,2176.4,2.32
is,2178.72,0.72
all said and done,2179.44,1.52
the covet would take,2180.96,1.92
many more lives yeah,2182.88,2.08
so i mean 0.2 is sounds like a small,2184.96,2.0
number but it's not a small number,2186.96,1.52
worldwide what do you think that number,2188.48,1.92
will be,2190.4,0.959
by the you know that's not that's not,2191.359,1.921
like but would we cross i think it's in,2193.28,2.88
the united states it's uh,2196.16,2.959
the way the desk currently reports like,2199.119,1.681
800 000 something like that do you think,2200.8,2.16
we'll cross a million seems likely,2202.96,3.2
yeah do you think it's something that,2206.16,2.08
might continue with different variants,2208.24,2.0
what well i i think um so we can talk,2210.24,2.0
about the end state of cover the end,2212.24,1.28
state of covet is it's here forever,2213.52,2.64
i think that there is good evidence of,2216.16,4.08
immunity after infection,2220.24,4.08
such that you're protected both against,2224.32,1.92
reinfection and also against severe,2226.24,2.56
disease upon reinfection,2228.8,2.4
so the second time you get it it's not,2231.2,1.76
true for everyone but for many people,2232.96,1.6
the second time you get it will be,2234.56,1.279
milder much milder than the first time,2235.839,2.081
you get it with the long tail like uh,2237.92,3.28
that lasts for a long time yeah so just,2241.2,2.32
there's studies that uh that follow of,2243.52,2.079
course people who are infected for a,2245.599,1.601
year,2247.2,0.96
and the reinfection rate is something,2248.16,1.52
like somewhere between point three and,2249.68,1.919
one percent yeah um and like a pretty,2251.599,3.441
fantastic study italy's found that,2255.04,1.68
there's there was one in sweden i think,2256.72,1.92
there's a few studies that found there's,2258.64,1.36
some similar things um and the,2260.0,3.04
reinfections,2263.04,1.84
tend to produce much mild disease much,2264.88,2.16
less likely end up in the hospital much,2267.04,1.44
less likely to die um so what the end,2268.48,3.04
state of covid is it's circulating the,2271.52,2.079
population forever and you get it,2273.599,1.361
multiple times,2274.96,1.44
yeah,2276.4,1.199
and and then there's,2277.599,1.441
i think studies and discussions like the,2279.04,2.72
the best protection would be to get it,2281.76,2.4
and then also to get vaccinated and then,2284.16,2.32
a lot of people push back against that,2286.48,2.16
for the obvious reasons from both sides,2288.64,2.0
because somehow this the discourse has,2290.64,2.0
become less scientific and more,2292.64,1.28
political well i think you wanna like,2293.92,2.56
the first time you meet it is going to,2296.48,2.0
be the most deadly for you,2298.48,1.68
and so the first time you meet it is,2300.16,1.52
wise to be vaccinated the vaccine,2301.68,1.52
reduces severe disease,2303.2,2.08
yeah well we'll talk about the vaccine,2305.28,2.24
because i want to make sure i address it,2307.52,1.52
carefully,2309.04,1.039
and properly in full context,2310.079,3.52
um,2313.599,1.281
but yes sort of uh to add to the context,2314.88,3.04
a lot of the fascinating discussions,2317.92,1.76
we're having is um in the early days of,2319.68,2.48
covid and now for people who are,2322.16,2.88
unvaccinated that's where the,2325.04,1.76
interesting story is,2326.8,2.16
the policy story the sociology,2328.96,2.08
sociological story and so on but,2331.04,2.799
let me go to something really,2333.839,1.201
fascinating just because of the people,2335.04,2.0
involved the human beings evolved and,2337.04,2.4
because of how deeply i care about,2339.44,2.639
science and also kindness respect and,2342.079,2.641
love and human things,2344.72,2.96
francis collins wrote a letter in,2347.68,2.56
october 2020,2350.24,1.92
to anthony fauci anything somebody else,2352.16,3.679
i have um,2355.839,2.881
the letter oh it's not a letter email i,2358.96,1.84
apologize,2360.8,1.2
uh hi tony and cliff,2362.0,2.88
c,2364.88,0.959
gb declaration.org,2365.839,3.441
this proposal,2369.28,1.6
this is the great barrington declaration,2370.88,2.0
that you're a co-author on this proposal,2372.88,2.719
from the three fringe epidemiologists,2375.599,2.961
who met with the secretary seem to be,2378.56,1.92
getting a lot of attention and even a,2380.48,2.08
co-signature from nobel prize winner,2382.56,3.36
mike levitt at stanford,2385.92,2.56
there needs to be a quick and,2388.48,1.68
devastating published takedown,2390.16,2.959
of its premises,2393.119,1.521
i don't see anything like that online,2394.64,2.56
yet is it underway question mark francis,2397.2,3.12
francis collins director of the nih,2400.32,2.88
somebody i talked to on this podcast,2403.2,1.6
recently,2404.8,1.2
okay,2406.0,1.599
a million questions i want to ask but,2407.599,2.321
first how did that make you feel when,2409.92,2.72
you first,2412.64,1.12
saw this uh email come to uh,2413.76,3.599
uh too light which when when when did it,2417.359,2.401
come to light uh this week actually i,2419.76,2.079
think or last week okay so this is,2421.839,1.841
because of freedom of information yeah,2423.68,2.56
which by the way,2426.24,1.68
sort of um,2427.92,1.76
maybe because i do want to add positive,2429.68,2.08
stuff on the on the side of francis here,2431.76,2.88
um,2434.64,1.6
boy when i see stuff like that i wonder,2436.24,2.079
if all my emails leaked,2438.319,2.641
how much embarrassing stuff like i think,2440.96,2.48
i'm a good person,2443.44,1.52
but i don't,2444.96,1.92
i haven't read my old emails maybe i'm,2446.88,3.28
pretty sure sometimes later i could be,2450.16,1.76
an,2451.92,1.199
well i mean look he's a christian and,2453.119,1.841
i'm a christian i'm supposed to forgive,2454.96,1.68
right i mean i think,2456.64,1.439
he was looking at this,2458.079,3.361
great barrington declaration as a,2461.44,1.28
political problem to be solved,2462.72,2.48
as opposed to a serious alternative,2465.2,2.8
approach to the epidemic,2468.0,1.92
so maybe we'll talk about in more detail,2469.92,2.24
but just for in case people are not,2472.16,2.32
familiar great barrington declaration,2474.48,1.68
was,2476.16,0.88
was was the document,2477.04,1.76
that you co-authored,2478.8,1.92
that basically argues against this idea,2480.72,2.48
of lock down as a solution to covid and,2483.2,3.04
you propose another solution that we'll,2486.24,2.32
talk about but the point is,2488.56,2.0
it's not,2490.56,1.36
that dramatic of a document,2491.92,2.88
it is just a document that criticizes,2494.8,2.08
one policy solution that was but it was,2496.88,2.239
the policy solution that had been put,2499.119,1.521
forward by,2500.64,1.52
dr collins and by tony fauci,2502.16,2.64
and a few other few other science not i,2504.8,2.24
mean i think a relatively small number,2507.04,1.76
of scientists and epidemiologists in,2508.8,2.16
charge of,2510.96,2.32
the advice given to governments,2513.28,1.76
worldwide,2515.04,1.52
and it was a challenge to that policy,2516.56,3.36
that said that look there there is an,2519.92,1.919
alternate path that that the path we've,2521.839,2.161
chosen this path of lock down with an,2524.0,2.24
aim to suppress the virus to zero,2526.24,2.0
effectively i mean that was unstated um,2528.24,3.04
cannot work and is causing catastrophic,2531.28,2.48
harm to,2533.76,1.599
large numbers of poor and vulnerable,2535.359,1.521
people worldwide,2536.88,2.32
we put this out in october 4th i think,2539.2,2.399
of 2020,2541.599,1.841
and,2543.44,0.96
it went viral i mean i've never actually,2544.4,2.16
been involved with anything like like,2546.56,1.92
this where i just put the document on,2548.48,2.16
the web,2550.64,0.88
and tens of thousands of doctors signed,2551.52,2.24
on hundreds of thousands of regular,2553.76,1.76
people signed on,2555.52,1.599
it it really struck a accord of uh,2557.119,2.641
people because i think even by october,2559.76,1.44
of 2020 people had this sense that there,2561.2,1.919
was something really wrong,2563.119,1.841
with the coveted policy that we've been,2564.96,1.44
following,2566.4,1.679
and they were looking for,2568.079,3.121
reasonable people to give an alternative,2571.2,1.6
i mean we're not arguing that covet,2572.8,1.6
doesn't isn't a serious thing i mean it,2574.4,2.32
is a very serious thing this is why we,2576.72,1.44
we had a policy that aimed at addressing,2578.16,2.56
it,2580.72,0.8
um,2581.52,0.799
we were but we were saying that the,2582.319,2.081
policy we're following is not the right,2584.4,1.919
one,2586.319,1.76
so how does a democratic,2588.079,2.0
uh government deal with that challenge,2590.079,3.361
uh so to me that you asked me how i felt,2593.44,2.399
i was actually frankly just i was i i,2595.839,2.321
suspected there had been some email,2598.16,1.6
exchanges like that not necessarily from,2599.76,1.76
francis collins,2601.52,1.52
around the government around this,2603.04,1.92
time i mean i felt the full brunt of a,2604.96,2.48
propaganda campaign,2607.44,2.879
almost immediately after we published it,2610.319,2.0
where newspapers mischaracterized it in,2612.319,2.8
all in the same the same way over and,2615.119,1.761
over and over again,2616.88,2.32
and sought to,2619.2,1.52
characterize me as sort of of a as a,2620.72,2.48
sort of a marginal fringe figure or,2623.2,1.44
whatnot and me and sinatra grouped uh,2624.64,2.16
martin culdor for the tens of thousands,2626.8,1.519
of other people that signed it,2628.319,1.841
i felt the brunt of that,2630.16,1.919
all year long,2632.079,1.361
so to see this in black and white in you,2633.44,3.36
know with the handwriting essentially if,2636.8,1.6
i mean the the metaphorical handwriting,2638.4,1.84
of francis collins was actually frankly,2640.24,1.2
a disappointment because i i've looked,2641.44,2.0
up to him for years,2643.44,1.76
yeah i've looked up them as well,2645.2,2.32
i um,2647.52,1.839
i mean i look for the the best in people,2649.359,2.72
and,2652.079,1.28
i still look up to him,2653.359,1.841
what troubles me is several things,2655.2,3.68
the reason i said about the,2659.76,2.0
the emails that i send late at,2661.76,2.079
night,2663.839,1.28
is um,2665.119,1.681
i can understand this email,2666.8,3.039
it's fear it's panic not being sure,2669.839,4.321
the fringe three fringe epidemiologists,2674.16,3.12
plus mike levitt who won a nobel prize i,2677.28,2.48
mean but using fringe,2679.76,3.359
maybe in my private thoughts i have said,2683.119,2.801
things like that about others,2685.92,1.919
like a little bit too unkind like you,2687.839,2.721
don't really mean it,2690.56,1.6
now add to that,2692.16,1.84
he,2694.0,0.88
recently this week whatever,2694.88,2.32
uh,2697.2,0.879
double down on the fringe,2698.079,2.081
this is really troubling to me,2700.16,2.24
that like i can excuse this email but,2702.4,3.12
to see the arrogance there,2705.52,2.559
i that francis honestly i mean,2708.079,2.801
broke my heart a little bit there this,2710.88,1.92
was an opportunity to like especially at,2712.8,1.92
this stage,2714.72,1.28
to say,2716.0,1.52
just like i told him um,2717.52,2.72
to say i was wrong to use those words in,2720.24,2.0
that email,2722.24,1.359
i was i was wrong to not be open to,2723.599,2.641
ideas,2726.24,1.04
i still believe that this is not like,2727.28,2.64
say,2729.92,1.04
like actually argue with the with the,2730.96,2.08
proposed with the policy of the proposed,2733.04,2.16
uh solution also,2735.2,3.44
the devastating publish take devastating,2738.72,4.08
takedown,2742.8,1.44
devastating takedown as you say,2744.24,2.8
somebody who's sitting,2747.04,2.0
on billions of dollars that they're,2749.04,2.72
giving to,2751.76,1.68
scientists,2753.44,1.2
some of whom are often not their best,2754.64,2.56
human beings because they're fighting,2757.2,1.76
with each other over money not being,2758.96,2.159
cognizant of the fact that you're,2761.119,3.601
challenging the integrity you're,2764.96,1.84
corrupting the integrity of scientists,2766.8,1.92
by allocating the money,2768.72,2.0
you're now playing with that,2770.72,2.639
by saying devastating takedown,2773.359,2.641
where do you think the published,2776.0,1.68
takedown will come from,2777.68,1.76
it will come from those scientists to,2779.44,2.159
whom you're giving money what kind of,2781.599,2.401
example would they give to the academic,2784.0,2.48
community that thrives on freedom like,2786.48,2.639
this this is,2789.119,1.681
i believe francis collins is a great man,2790.8,3.6
one of the things i was troubled by is,2794.4,2.4
the negative response to him from people,2796.8,2.4
that don't understand the positive,2799.2,2.159
impact that nih has had on society how,2801.359,2.72
many people has helped but this is,2804.079,2.721
exactly the so he's not just a scientist,2806.8,3.2
he's not just a bureaucrat who,2810.0,2.16
distributes money he's also a scientific,2812.16,2.64
leader,2814.8,0.88
that in the time in difficult times we,2815.68,2.24
live in is supposed to inspire us with,2817.92,2.64
trust with love with the freedom of,2820.56,3.6
thought he's supposed to you know those,2824.16,2.4
fringe epidemiologists those are the,2826.56,2.559
heroes of science when you look at the,2829.119,2.561
long arc of history we love those people,2831.68,3.84
we love ideas even when they get proven,2835.52,2.24
wrong that's what always that attracted,2837.76,1.76
me to science like some somebody like,2839.52,2.24
the the lone voice saying oh no the the,2841.76,3.28
the moon of jupiter does move,2845.04,3.12
yeah i mean you know but the funny thing,2848.16,1.679
is you know galileo is saying something,2849.839,2.0
truly revolutionary we were saying,2851.839,2.0
that what we proposed in the great,2853.839,1.201
britain declaration was actually just,2855.04,1.68
the old pandemic plan,2856.72,2.08
it wasn't anything really,2858.8,1.92
fundamentally novel,2860.72,2.32
in fact there were,2863.04,1.76
plans like this that,2864.8,3.2
lockdown scientists had written in late,2868.0,2.559
february early march of 2020. so we were,2870.559,2.481
not saying anything radical we were just,2873.04,1.68
calling for a debate,2874.72,1.599
effectively over the existing lockdown,2876.319,2.721
policy,2879.04,1.279
um and this is a disappointment a really,2880.319,2.721
truly a big disappointment because,2883.04,2.48
by doing this,2885.52,1.599
you were absolutely right lex he sent a,2887.119,1.921
signal,2889.04,1.039
to so many other scientists to just stay,2890.079,2.641
silent even if you had reservations,2892.72,2.32
yeah devastating takedown the people you,2895.04,3.279
know how many people wrote to me,2898.319,1.841
privately like stanford mit,2900.16,3.6
how amazing,2903.76,1.52
the conversation with francis collins,2905.28,1.839
was,2907.119,0.96
there's a kind of admiration because,2908.079,3.681
okay how do i put it um,2911.76,4.0
a lot of people,2915.76,1.599
get into science because they want to,2917.359,1.521
help the world,2918.88,1.439
they get excited by the ideas and they,2920.319,2.321
and they they really are working hard to,2922.64,2.8
help in whatever the discipline is and,2925.44,2.56
then there is sources of funding,2928.0,2.64
which help you do help at a larger scale,2930.64,2.56
so you admire those the people that uh,2933.2,2.879
um,2936.079,0.881
are distributing the money because,2936.96,1.52
they're often,2938.48,1.2
at least on the surface are really also,2939.68,2.399
good people oftentimes they're great,2942.079,1.681
scientists so like it's amazing i that's,2943.76,3.2
why i'm sort of um,2946.96,3.599
like sometimes people from outside think,2950.559,1.681
academia is broken some kind of way no,2952.24,2.48
it's it's a beautiful thing it's a it's,2954.72,2.08
really is a beautiful thing and that's,2956.8,1.279
why it's so deeply heartbreaking where,2958.079,1.841
this person,2959.92,1.52
um,2961.44,1.119
is um i don't think this is malevolence,2962.559,3.76
i think he's just incompetence of,2966.319,2.24
communication,2968.559,1.921
twice i think there's there's also,2970.48,1.68
arrogance at the bottom of it too so,2972.16,1.6
like but you know all of us have,2973.76,1.52
arrogance yeah there's a particular kind,2975.28,1.92
of arrogance right so here it's it's of,2977.2,1.84
the same kind of arrogance that you see,2979.04,2.16
when tony fauci gets on tv and says that,2981.2,3.28
uh that if you criticize me you're not,2984.48,2.32
simply criticizing a man you're,2986.8,1.759
criticizing science itself right right,2988.559,2.401
that is at the heart also of this email,2990.96,3.92
this so the certainty,2994.88,2.08
that the policies that they were,2996.96,1.84
recommending collins and fauci were,2998.8,1.6
recommending to the president of the,3000.4,1.36
united states were right not just right,3001.76,2.319
but right so so far right that any,3004.079,2.881
challenge whatsoever to it is dangerous,3006.96,3.52
um and i think that that is really the,3010.48,2.24
heart of that email it's it's um it's,3012.72,2.0
this idea that,3014.72,2.56
my position is unchallengeable,3017.28,2.4
not to be to be complete to be as,3019.68,2.159
charitable as i can be to this you know,3021.839,2.641
i believe they thought that i believe,3024.48,1.44
they some of them still think that that,3025.92,2.159
that there was only one true policy,3028.079,2.641
possible in response to copenhagen every,3030.72,2.08
other policy was immoral,3032.8,3.279
and if you if you come from that,3036.079,1.201
position then you write an email like,3037.28,1.52
that you go on tv you say effectively,3038.8,3.44
right i mean that that is that is what,3042.24,1.68
happens when you have this sort of,3043.92,2.32
unchallengeable arrogance that the,3046.24,1.52
policy you're following is correct,3047.76,1.839
um i mean when we wrote the great bank,3049.599,1.52
declaration,3051.119,0.96
what i was hoping for,3052.079,1.601
was a discussion,3053.68,1.919
about how to protect the vulnerable i,3055.599,2.081
mean that was the key idea to me in the,3057.68,1.76
whole thing was,3059.44,1.36
better protection of the older,3060.8,1.519
population who really at really serious,3062.319,2.0
risk if infected with covid and we had,3064.319,2.24
been doing a very poor job i thought to,3066.559,2.081
date in many places in protecting the,3068.64,1.76
vulnerable,3070.4,1.76
and what i wanted was a discussion by,3072.16,2.64
local public health,3074.8,1.68
about better methods better policies to,3076.48,2.24
protect the vulnerable,3078.72,2.639
so when when i was when we were met with,3081.359,2.96
instead a series of essentially,3084.319,2.321
propagandist lies about it so they for,3086.64,2.24
instance i kept hearing from reporters,3088.88,2.56
in in those days why do you want to let,3091.44,2.159
the virus rip let it rip let it rip the,3093.599,2.24
words let it rip,3095.839,1.681
does not appear in the great barrington,3097.52,2.48
declaration,3100.0,1.2
the goal isn't to let the virus rip um,3101.2,2.399
the goal is to protect the vulnerable,3103.599,2.321
to let society go as you know open,3105.92,3.199
schools and do other things that it,3109.119,1.841
functions as best it can in the midst of,3110.96,1.52
a terrible pandemic yes,3112.48,2.24
but not let the virus rip,3114.72,2.48
where no the most vulnerable are,3117.2,1.68
protected the goal was to protect the,3118.88,1.52
vulnerable so why let it rip because it,3120.4,2.48
was a propaganda term to hit the fear,3122.88,2.959
centers of people's brains oh these,3125.839,2.0
people are immoral they just want to let,3127.839,1.681
the virus go through society and hurt,3129.52,1.599
everybody that was that was that was the,3131.119,1.841
idea this it was a way to preclude a,3132.96,2.72
discussion and preclude a debate about,3135.68,2.48
the existing policy,3138.16,1.76
so i've uh,3139.92,1.52
this is an app called clubhouse,3141.44,2.879
um i've gone back on it recently,3144.319,3.441
uh to practice russian unrelated for for,3147.76,3.04
a few big russian conversations coming,3150.8,1.759
up anyway it's a great way to talk to,3152.559,1.841
regular people in russian but i also,3154.4,2.0
there was a i was i was nervous i was,3156.4,2.08
preparing for a pfizer ceo conversation,3158.48,2.16
and there was a vaccine room and so i,3160.64,2.16
joined it,3162.8,1.92
and there's a there's a pro science room,3164.72,3.28
as they they these are like scientists,3168.0,1.92
that were calling each other pro science,3169.92,2.24
it the whole thing was like theater to,3172.16,2.72
me i mean i haven't thoroughly,3174.88,1.76
researched but looking at the resume,3176.64,1.439
they were like,3178.079,1.361
pretty solid um,3179.44,2.399
researchers and doctors,3181.839,2.161
and they were mocking,3184.0,2.24
everybody,3186.24,2.319
who was at all i mean it doesn't matter,3188.559,2.321
what they stood for but they were just,3190.88,1.439
mocking people and the arrogance was,3192.319,2.24
overwhelming i had to shut off,3194.559,3.04
because i couldn't handle that human,3197.599,2.0
beings can be like this to each other,3199.599,1.841
and then i i went back to just a double,3201.44,2.639
check is this really how many people are,3204.079,2.161
here is this theater and then i uh asked,3206.24,3.599
to come on stage on clubhouse to make a,3209.839,2.0
couple comments and then as i open my,3211.839,2.24
mouth and say thank you so much you know,3214.079,2.0
this is this is a great room sort of the,3216.079,2.161
usual civil politeness all that kind of,3218.24,2.079
stuff,3220.319,1.28
and,3221.599,1.601
i said i'm worried that,3223.2,2.639
the kind of arrogance with which,3225.839,3.52
things are being discussed here,3229.359,2.161
will further divide us not,3231.52,2.96
unite us and and before,3234.48,2.4
i said even the united further divide us,3236.88,3.52
i was thrown off stage now this isn't,3240.4,2.4
why i mentioned platform but like i am,3242.8,2.799
like uh lex friedman mit,3245.599,3.201
uh also which is something those people,3248.8,2.799
seem to sometimes care about the,3251.599,1.841
followers and stuff like that like did,3253.44,3.04
you just do that and then they said,3256.48,2.48
enough of that nonsense,3258.96,2.08
enough of that nonsense they said to me,3261.04,4.24
enough of that nonsense,3265.28,2.079
somebody who is obviously interviewed,3267.359,2.48
francis collins,3269.839,1.681
is uh uh the pfizer ceo uh you're,3271.52,3.52
bringing a potential epidemiologist also,3275.04,2.0
so just yeah exactly but this broke my,3277.04,2.48
heart the arrogance and this is echoes,3279.52,2.72
of that arrogance is something you see,3282.24,1.44
in this email and i really would love to,3283.68,2.48
have a million things to talk about to,3286.16,1.36
try to figure out how can we find a path,3287.52,2.24
forward i think a lot of,3289.76,1.92
a lot of the problems,3291.68,1.84
we've seen in the,3293.52,2.079
the discussion over cove especially in,3295.599,1.76
the scientific community,3297.359,1.601
you know there's there's two ways to,3298.96,1.44
look at science i think uh that that,3300.4,2.24
have been competing with each other for,3302.64,1.6
a while now,3304.24,2.0
one way and this is the way that i view,3306.24,2.079
science and why i've always found it so,3308.319,1.52
attractive,3309.839,1.041
is an invitation to a structured,3310.88,2.08
discussion,3312.96,1.2
where,3314.16,1.199
the the discussion is tempered by by,3315.359,2.161
evidence by data by by reasoning and,3317.52,3.12
logic,3320.64,1.04
right so it's a dialectical process,3321.68,2.159
where if i believe a and you believe b,3323.839,3.041
well uh we talk about it we come up with,3326.88,3.12
an experiment that distinguishes between,3330.0,1.68
the two and while you know b turns out,3331.68,2.48
to be right i'm i'm all frustrated but i,3334.16,2.0
buy you dinner and i say no no no c and,3336.16,2.32
then we go on from there right that's,3338.48,2.319
that's what science is at its best it's,3340.799,2.641
this process of using data in discussion,3343.44,2.879
it's a human activity right uh to to to,3346.319,3.121
learn,3349.44,1.119
to let have the truth unfold itself,3350.559,2.161
before us,3352.72,1.359
on the other hand there are,3354.079,2.401
there's another way that people have,3356.48,1.359
used science or thought about science as,3357.839,2.161
a as truth in and of itself,3360.0,3.04
right this like if it's if it's science,3363.04,1.759
therefore it's true automatically and,3364.799,2.241
they're,3367.04,1.039
you know what does the science say to do,3368.079,2.0
well the science never says to do,3370.079,1.601
anything the science says here's what's,3371.68,1.679
true and then we have to,3373.359,1.601
apply our human values,3374.96,2.24
to say okay well if we do this well then,3377.2,3.44
this is likely to happen that's what the,3380.64,1.439
science says if we do that then that is,3382.079,2.161
likely to happen well we'd rather have,3384.24,1.599
this than that right and but it doesn't,3385.839,2.561
science doesn't tell us that we'd rather,3388.4,1.36
have this than that is there human,3389.76,1.039
values that tell us that we'd rather,3390.799,1.28
this and that science plays a role but,3392.079,1.841
it's not the only thing,3393.92,1.679
uh it's not the only role it's like it,3395.599,2.161
helps us understand the constraints we,3397.76,1.68
face but it doesn't tell us what to do,3399.44,2.08
in face of those constraints,3401.52,1.599
but underneath it at the individual,3403.119,2.081
level at the institutional level it,3405.2,1.76
seems like,3406.96,1.76
um,3408.72,0.879
arrogance,3409.599,1.601
is really destructive so the flip side,3411.2,2.24
of that the productive thing is humility,3413.44,2.24
so sort of um,3415.68,3.119
always not being,3418.799,2.32
sure that you're right,3421.119,1.761
this is actually kind of uh,3422.88,2.08
stuart russell talks about this for ai,3424.96,2.24
research how do you make sure that ai,3427.2,2.159
super intelligent ai doesn't destroy us,3429.359,1.841
you built in um,3431.2,2.399
a sort of module within it that it,3433.599,2.0
always doubts,3435.599,1.921
its actions like it's not sure,3437.52,2.4
like i know it says i'm supposed to,3439.92,2.0
destroy all humans but maybe i'm wrong,3441.92,2.8
and that maybe i'm wrong is essential,3444.72,2.24
for progress for actually doing in the,3446.96,2.08
long arc of history better not the,3449.04,2.079
perfect thing but better and better and,3451.119,1.361
better and better i mean the the,3452.48,1.52
question i have here for you is,3454.0,2.559
this,3456.559,1.361
this email so clearly captures some,3457.92,3.199
maybe echo but maybe a core to the,3461.119,2.081
problem do you put responsibility of,3463.2,2.639
this email of the shortcomings,3465.839,3.041
and failures on individuals or,3468.88,2.16
institutions,3471.04,2.48
no this is an institutional failure,3473.52,1.52
right so um the nih i so i've had two,3475.04,3.039
decades of nih funding i've sat on nih,3478.079,1.841
review panels the purpose of the nih is,3479.92,2.56
what you said earlier lex the purpose of,3482.48,1.68
nih is to support the work of scientists,3484.16,3.76
to some extent it's also how to help,3487.92,2.08
scientists to direct scientists to work,3490.0,2.16
on things that are very important for,3492.16,1.52
public health or for the health of the,3493.68,1.679
public,3495.359,1.2
um so and the way you do that is you say,3496.559,2.0
okay we're gonna put,3498.559,1.441
you know 50 million dollars on uh the,3500.0,2.24
research in alzheimer's disease this,3502.24,1.92
year or 70 million dollars on hiv or,3504.16,1.84
whatever it is right some and uh that,3506.0,2.24
pot of money then uh scientists compete,3508.24,2.48
with each other for the best ideas to to,3510.72,2.16
use it to address that that problem so,3512.88,3.36
it's essentially an endeavor to support,3516.24,2.559
the work of scientists it is not in and,3518.799,2.8
of itself a policy organ,3521.599,3.361
it doesn't say what public health policy,3524.96,2.48
should be,3527.44,1.52
for that you have the cdc,3528.96,3.28
and,3532.4,0.8
what happened during the pandemic is,3533.2,2.24
that,3535.44,0.96
people,3536.4,1.04
in the nih were called upon,3537.44,2.72
to contribute to public health making,3540.16,4.639
and that created the conflict of,3544.799,1.681
interest you see in that email,3546.48,2.24
right so now you have the head of the,3548.72,2.879
nih,3551.599,1.2
in effect saying to all scientists you,3552.799,2.32
must agree with me,3555.119,1.841
in the policies that i've recommended,3556.96,3.839
or else you're fringe,3560.799,2.721
that is a deep conflict of interest it's,3563.52,1.839
deep because first he he's conflicted he,3565.359,2.161
has this dual role as,3567.52,1.839
as as the head of the nih,3569.359,2.161
supporter of scientific funding and then,3571.52,1.76
also,3573.28,1.2
inappropriately called to set or help,3574.48,2.319
set,3576.799,0.961
pandemic policy,3577.76,1.599
that should never have happened there,3579.359,1.521
should be a bright line between those,3580.88,2.64
two roles,3583.52,1.839
let me ask you about just francis,3585.359,1.361
collins i don't know if you i i had a,3586.72,1.76
chance to talk to him on a podcast i,3588.48,1.28
don't know if you maybe by chance gotten,3589.76,1.599
a chance to hear a few words of it,3591.359,2.48
um well i have a kind of a question uh,3593.839,2.401
to that because a lot of people,3596.24,3.2
wrote to me quite negative things about,3599.44,2.08
francis collins and like i said i still,3601.52,2.079
believe,3603.599,1.281
he's a great man a great scientist,3604.88,2.719
um,3607.599,1.681
one of the things when i,3609.28,1.6
talked to him off mike,3610.88,2.479
about the vaccine,3613.359,3.041
the excitement he had about when we were,3616.799,3.04
recollecting when they first got an,3619.839,3.121
inkling that it's actually going to be,3622.96,1.76
possible to get a vaccine,3624.72,2.079
just he wasn't messaging just in the,3626.799,2.641
private or of our own conversation he,3629.44,1.919
was really excited and why was he,3631.359,2.0
excited because he gets to help a lot of,3633.359,2.24
people this is a man,3635.599,2.321
that really wants to help people and,3637.92,3.12
there could be some institutional,3641.04,1.68
self-delusion the arrogance all those,3642.72,1.68
kinds of things that lead to this kind,3644.4,2.159
of email but ultimately the the goal is,3646.559,2.24
this is what i don't think people quite,3648.799,1.601
realize this,3650.4,1.28
the reason you call your fringe,3651.68,1.919
epidemiologist the reason there needs to,3653.599,2.48
be a devastating uh published takedown,3656.079,2.881
he i believe really believes,3658.96,2.879
that this it could be very dangerous,3661.839,3.201
yeah and,3665.04,1.44
it's a lot of burden to carry on his,3666.48,2.24
shoulders because like you said in his,3668.72,2.0
role where he defines some of the public,3670.72,1.839
policy,3672.559,1.76
like,3674.319,1.04
you know depending on how he thinks,3675.359,2.321
about the world,3677.68,1.28
millions of people could die because of,3678.96,1.76
one decision he make yeah and that's a,3680.72,2.48
lot of burden to walk with yeah no i,3683.2,2.08
think that's right i don't think that he,3685.28,1.68
has bad intentions,3686.96,2.32
i think that he was,3689.28,1.44
basically put was put or maybe put,3690.72,2.32
himself in a position where,3693.04,3.2
this kind of conflict of interest was,3696.24,1.839
going to create this kind of this this,3698.079,2.24
kind of a reaction,3700.319,2.0
right the kind of humility that you're,3702.319,1.441
calling for is almost impossible when,3703.76,1.839
you have that dual dual role this that,3705.599,2.641
shouldn't you shouldn't have to have as,3708.24,2.079
as funder of science and also center of,3710.319,2.081
scientific policy i agree with,3712.4,1.36
everything you just said except the last,3713.76,1.279
part the the humility is almost,3715.039,2.32
impossible that,3717.359,1.921
uh,3719.28,0.72
humility is always difficult i think,3720.0,2.559
i think there's a huge incentive to for,3722.559,2.321
humility in that position,3724.88,1.6
now look at history,3726.48,2.079
great leaders that have humility,3728.559,4.24
are popular as hell,3732.799,1.601
so if you like being popular,3734.4,2.24
if you like having impact legacy,3736.64,2.88
these descendants of apes seem to care,3739.52,1.839
about legacy especially as they get,3741.359,1.841
older in these high positions like i i,3743.2,3.119
think the incentive for humility is,3746.319,1.361
pretty high well i mean the thing is is,3747.68,1.52
like there's a lot that he has to be,3749.2,1.76
proud of in his career i mean like the,3750.96,2.0
human genome project,3752.96,1.44
wouldn't have happened without him uh,3754.4,1.76
and he is he is a great man and a great,3756.16,2.159
scientist but so it is tragic to me that,3758.319,2.72
his career has ended in this particular,3761.039,1.681
way,3762.72,1.839
he asked you a question about um,3764.559,3.201
my podcast conversation with them,3767.76,2.799
by way of advice or maybe criticism,3770.559,3.76
there's a lot of people that wrote to me,3774.319,1.921
kind words of support,3776.24,1.92
and,3778.16,0.959
a lot of people that wrote to me,3779.119,1.601
respectful constructive criticism,3780.72,2.56
how would you suggest to have,3783.28,2.0
conversations with folks like that,3785.28,2.48
and,3787.76,0.96
maybe um i mean because there's i have,3788.72,2.8
other conversations like this including,3791.52,1.76
i was debating whether to talk to,3793.28,2.72
anthony fauci he wanted to talk,3796.0,3.119
and so,3799.119,1.601
what kind of conversation do you have,3800.72,1.92
and sorry to take us on a tangent but,3802.64,2.0
almost from an interview,3804.64,1.679
perspective of how to inspire humility,3806.319,2.8
and inspire trust,3809.119,1.92
in science or maybe give hope that we,3811.039,2.161
know what the heck we're doing and we're,3813.2,1.359
going to figure this out i mean i think,3814.559,2.641
you're,3817.2,1.119
i've been now interviewed by many people,3818.319,1.921
um,3820.24,0.799
i think uh,3821.039,1.601
the style you have really works well lex,3822.64,1.76
you have to you because you i don't,3824.4,1.6
think you're going to be ever an attack,3826.0,2.0
dog,3828.0,0.88
trying to go after somebody and and,3828.88,2.0
force them to to like,3830.88,2.0
you know admit that they were wrong,3832.88,1.439
about or whatever about i mean that's,3834.319,1.921
that i also actually find that form of,3836.24,1.599
journalism and podcasting really,3837.839,2.0
off-putting it's hard to watch,3839.839,2.161
also it's a whole lot of the tangent is,3842.0,2.079
that actually effective i don't think so,3844.079,1.921
do you want to ask,3846.0,2.0
hitler,3848.0,1.039
and i think about this a lot actually,3849.039,1.28
interviewing hitler i've been studying a,3850.319,1.201
lot about the the the rise and the fall,3851.52,1.92
of the third reich,3853.44,1.52
i think about interviewing stalin like i,3854.96,1.839
put myself in that mindset like how do,3856.799,2.721
you,3859.52,1.039
have conversations with people to,3860.559,2.161
understand who they are so that not so,3862.72,2.639
you can sit there and yell at them yeah,3865.359,2.641
but to understand who they are so that,3868.0,1.52
you can inspire a very large number of,3869.52,2.16
people to be the best version of,3871.68,1.6
themselves and to avoid the mistakes of,3873.28,2.319
the past i believe that everyone,3875.599,2.72
that's involved in this debate has good,3878.319,1.76
intentions they have they're coming at,3880.079,2.161
it from their points of view uh they,3882.24,1.92
they don't they have um,3884.16,2.159
uh they have their weaknesses,3886.319,1.76
and if you can paint a picture in your,3888.079,2.0
questioning by sympathetic questioning,3890.079,2.641
of those strengths and weaknesses and,3892.72,2.48
their point of view you've done a,3895.2,1.119
service um that's really all you i,3896.319,2.48
personally like like to see in those,3898.799,1.841
kinds of interviews um i don't think a,3900.64,2.159
gotcha moment,3902.799,1.76
uh is really the key thing there the the,3904.559,2.161
key thing is understanding where they're,3906.72,1.52
coming from understanding their thinking,3908.24,2.319
understanding the constraints they faced,3910.559,1.681
and how did they manage them that's,3912.24,2.079
going to provide a much i mean for me,3914.319,1.921
that's what i look for when i when i,3916.24,1.28
listen to podcasts like yours,3917.52,1.92
um is is an understanding of that of,3919.44,2.0
that of that person,3921.44,1.84
and the moment and how they dealt with,3923.28,2.079
it,3925.359,0.801
i mean i guess the hope is,3926.16,2.159
to discover in a sympathetic way a flaw,3928.319,2.881
in a person's thinking together,3931.2,2.56
like,3933.76,1.039
as opposed to discovering the positive,3934.799,1.601
thing together you discover,3936.4,2.0
the thing well i didn't really think,3938.4,1.84
about that yeah i mean that's what,3940.24,1.28
that's how science is right that's why,3941.52,1.839
we found it i think find it so,3943.359,1.281
attractive is this i i i like it when a,3944.64,3.84
student shows me i'm thinking,3948.48,1.68
incorrectly,3950.16,1.28
right i think i'm really grateful to,3951.44,1.84
that student because now i have an,3953.28,2.079
opportunity to change my mind about it,3955.359,1.76
and then start thinking even more,3957.119,1.281
correctly i mean that's,3958.4,1.6
and there are moments when,3960.0,2.319
uh i mean like this is probably a good,3962.319,2.081
time to say like what i think i got,3964.4,1.439
wrong,3965.839,0.881
during the pandemic right so like for,3966.72,1.52
instance you said francis collins had a,3968.24,1.92
moment when uh he learned that that,3970.16,3.04
there was quite possible to get a,3973.2,1.76
vaccine going yeah he must have learned,3974.96,2.159
that quite early,3977.119,1.841
and i didn't learn that early,3978.96,2.399
i mean i i didn't know,3981.359,2.161
in march of 2020,3983.52,2.24
in my experience with vaccine,3985.76,1.68
development it would have take i thought,3987.44,1.84
it would take a decade or more to get a,3989.28,1.68
vaccine,3990.96,2.0
that was wrong right i didn't that that,3992.96,2.32
and and i was so happy when i started to,3995.28,3.2
see the preliminary numbers,3998.48,1.839
in the in the pfizer trial,4000.319,2.0
that strongly suggested it was going to,4002.319,2.0
work,4004.319,1.921
yeah and at the i was,4006.24,2.079
i mean like very few times in my life,4008.319,1.201
i'm so happy to be wrong,4009.52,2.319
and it changes kind of,4011.839,2.0
um i think i've heard you mention that,4013.839,1.921
lockdown is still a bad idea,4015.76,2.64
unless the vaccine comes out in like,4018.4,1.84
tomorrow,4020.24,1.119
uh there's still like,4021.359,2.48
suffering and economic pain all kinds of,4023.839,1.841
pain can still happen in even just a a,4025.68,2.639
scale of weeks,4028.319,1.441
um,4029.76,1.92
versus months,4031.68,1.439
yeah well let's talk about the vaccine,4033.119,3.121
what are your thoughts on the safety and,4036.24,2.0
efficacy of covered vaccines at the,4038.24,2.319
individual and the societal level so for,4040.559,2.881
the the vaccine safety data,4043.44,2.72
it's it's actually challenging,4046.16,2.48
to convey to the public how this is,4048.64,2.0
normally done like normally you would do,4050.64,1.76
this in the context of the trial you'd,4052.4,2.08
have a law a long trial with large,4054.48,1.839
numbers relatively large numbers of,4056.319,1.52
people you'd follow them over a long,4057.839,1.841
time and the trial will give you some,4059.68,1.359
indication of the safety of the vaccine,4061.039,2.641
and it did um i mean but,4063.68,2.56
you the the the trial the way it was,4066.24,2.16
constructed,4068.4,1.199
when it was came out that it was,4069.599,1.921
protective against covet it was no,4071.52,1.519
longer ethical to have a placebo arm,4073.039,3.201
and so that placebo arm is vaccinated,4076.24,1.68
what large part of it,4077.92,2.159
and so that meant that from the trial,4080.079,2.081
you are not going to be able to get,4082.16,2.48
data on the long-term safety profiles of,4084.64,2.32
the vaccine,4086.96,2.0
uh and also the other thing about trials,4088.96,1.68
although there's tens of thousands of,4090.64,1.6
people enrolled that's still not enough,4092.24,1.68
to get when you when it when you deploy,4093.92,2.318
a vaccine to the population scale you're,4096.238,2.722
going to see things that weren't in the,4098.96,1.198
trial,4100.158,0.962
guaranteed,4101.12,1.76
populations of people that weren't,4102.88,1.12
represented well in the trial are going,4104.0,1.839
to are going to be given the vaccine and,4105.839,2.081
then that they're going to have things,4107.92,1.359
that happen to them that you didn't,4109.279,1.281
didn't anticipate,4110.56,1.678
so,4112.238,1.121
i wasn't surprised when people were a,4113.359,1.839
little bit skeptical when the trial was,4115.198,1.842
done about the safety profile just the,4117.04,1.84
way the nature of the thing was going to,4118.88,1.358
make it so that it was going to be hard,4120.238,1.842
to get a complete picture from the,4122.08,1.759
trials itself and the trials showed they,4123.839,2.241
were pretty safe,4126.08,1.44
and quite effective at preventing,4127.52,3.199
both you from getting covid actually i,4130.719,2.241
think the main endpoint of the trial,4132.96,1.519
itself was a symptomatic covet,4134.479,3.041
right so um uh so that was like that was,4137.52,3.44
you know i mean it was really um,4140.96,2.238
to me like is about as amazing,4143.198,2.402
achievement as anything organizing a,4145.6,1.52
trial of that scale and running it so,4147.12,2.4
quickly,4149.52,1.12
and the final results being so,4150.64,2.32
surprisingly high so good right,4152.96,2.96
and um so,4155.92,1.519
the but the problem then was normally it,4157.439,3.28
would take a long time the fda would,4160.719,3.361
tell pfizer to go back and try it in,4164.08,1.84
this subgroup they'd work more on dosing,4165.92,2.559
they'd do all these kinds of things,4168.479,2.481
that kind of didn't we really didn't,4170.96,1.6
have time for in the middle of a,4172.56,1.119
pandemic right so you have a you have,4173.679,2.8
a basis for approval that it's less,4176.479,3.92
full than normally you would have for a,4180.399,2.161
population scale vaccine,4182.56,2.56
but the results were good results looked,4185.12,1.84
really good and actually i should say,4186.96,1.68
for the most part that's been borne out,4188.64,2.48
when we've given the vaccine at scale in,4191.12,1.92
terms of protection against severe,4193.04,1.679
disease,4194.719,1.121
yeah all right so people who have got,4195.84,1.76
the vaccine,4197.6,1.28
um for a very long time after they've,4198.88,1.839
had that for the full vaccination have,4200.719,2.081
had great protection against going being,4202.8,3.04
hospitalized and dying if they get,4205.84,1.76
covered let's separate because this,4207.6,2.72
seems to be,4210.32,1.6
um,4211.92,0.88
there's critics of both categories but,4212.8,2.08
different kids,4214.88,2.24
and,4217.12,0.8
kids and,4217.92,1.6
old not older people like uh,4219.52,2.32
let's say five years old and above or,4221.84,2.0
something like they're 13 years old and,4223.84,1.44
above so,4225.28,2.399
for those it seems like the reduction,4227.679,3.761
of uh the rate of fatalities and and,4231.44,3.04
serious illness seems to be something,4234.48,2.239
like 10x,4236.719,1.361
i mean for older people it is a godsend,4238.08,3.04
this vaccine it it transforms the the,4241.12,3.599
problem of focus protection from,4244.719,2.401
something that's quite challenging,4247.12,2.0
possible i believe but quite challenging,4249.12,1.599
to something that's much much more,4250.719,1.281
manageable because the vaccine in and of,4252.0,2.4
itself when deployed in older,4254.4,2.08
populations is a form of focus,4256.48,1.6
protection,4258.08,1.92
yes well by the way we'll talk about the,4260.0,2.239
focus protection in one segment because,4262.239,2.081
it's such a brilliant idea for this,4264.32,1.68
pandemic of future pandemics i thought,4266.0,2.719
the sociological psychological,4268.719,1.921
discussion about the letter from francis,4270.64,2.4
collins is um,4273.04,2.08
because it was so recent it was been so,4275.12,1.52
troubling to me so i'm glad we talked,4276.64,1.68
about that first,4278.32,1.76
but so the there seems to be,4280.08,3.2
the vaccines work to reduce deaths,4283.28,3.919
and that has especially the most,4287.199,2.48
transformative effects for the older so,4289.679,2.641
can i let you give i've told you one,4292.32,1.44
thing that i got wrong in the panic let,4293.76,1.28
me tell you the second thing i got wrong,4295.04,1.36
for sure in the pandemic,4296.4,1.759
in january of la of this year,4298.159,3.601
2021 i thought that the vaccines would,4301.76,3.52
stop infection,4305.28,2.64
yes right it would would make it so that,4307.92,2.319
you were much less likely to be infected,4310.239,2.241
at all,4312.48,0.96
because the the antibodies that were,4313.44,1.92
produced by the vaccines looked like,4315.36,1.28
they were neutralizing antibodies that,4316.64,1.599
would would essentially block you from,4318.239,1.601
being infected at all,4319.84,2.96
um,4322.8,1.04
that turned out to be wrong,4323.84,2.0
right so i think it became clear,4325.84,3.28
as data came out from israel which,4329.12,2.16
vaccinated very early that they were,4331.28,1.6
seeing surges of infection even in a,4332.88,2.4
very highly vaccinated population,4335.28,2.56
that,4337.84,0.96
that the vaccine does not stop infection,4338.8,2.879
so you're a used car salesman and you're,4341.679,2.721
selling the vaccine,4344.4,1.68
and the features you thought of vaccine,4346.08,1.92
would have i mean i have a similar kind,4348.0,1.44
of sense when the vaccine came out,4349.44,2.16
vaccine would,4351.6,1.92
reduce,4353.52,1.76
if you somehow were able to get it you,4355.28,2.24
would reduce rate of death and all those,4357.52,1.679
kinds of things but it would also reduce,4359.199,2.641
the chance of you,4361.84,1.359
getting it and if you do get it the,4363.199,2.561
chance that you transmitting it to,4365.76,1.6
somebody else,4367.36,1.44
and it turns out that those latter two,4368.8,2.96
things are not as uh definitive or in,4371.76,3.04
fact they're i mean i don't know to,4374.8,1.6
which agree they're not i mean i think,4376.4,1.6
it's it's a little complicated because i,4378.0,1.36
think the first two or three months,4379.36,2.08
after you're fully vaccinated after the,4381.44,1.279
second dose you have,4382.719,3.601
60 70 percent efficacy peak against,4386.32,2.56
infection yeah so uh that which is,4388.88,2.48
pretty good i mean right but by,4391.36,2.24
six seven eight months that drops to 20,4393.6,2.4
percent some places some studies like,4396.0,2.48
there's a study out of sweden suggested,4398.48,1.44
it might even drop to zero but and then,4399.92,2.08
you're also infectious for some period,4402.0,1.84
of time if you do get it even though,4403.84,2.08
you're vaccinated correct although there,4405.92,1.84
seems to be,4407.76,1.2
lucy data that the period of time your,4408.96,1.84
infectious is short it's shorter but the,4410.8,2.16
the infectivity per day is about as high,4412.96,3.44
so you still it's the point is that that,4416.4,2.319
the vaccine might reduce some risk of,4418.719,2.241
infecting others but it's not a,4420.96,1.44
categorical difference,4422.4,2.319
so uh a unvaccine it's not safe to be in,4424.719,4.241
the presence of just vaccinated people,4428.96,2.16
you can still get infected,4431.12,2.64
right so i mean there's a million things,4433.76,2.32
i want to ask here but,4436.08,2.32
is there in some sense because the,4438.4,1.839
vaccine,4440.239,1.361
um,4441.6,1.28
really helps on the worst,4442.88,2.56
part of this pandemic which is killing,4445.44,2.16
people yes,4447.6,1.92
uh doesn't that mean,4449.52,1.84
uh where does the vaccine hesitancy come,4451.36,3.12
from,4454.48,1.04
in terms of it seems like obviously a,4455.52,2.719
vaccine is a powerful solution to let us,4458.239,2.96
open this thing up yeah so i wrote a,4461.199,2.161
wall street journal op-ed with sinatra,4463.36,1.6
gupta in december of last year yes a,4464.96,2.719
very night with a very naive title which,4467.679,2.161
says we can end the lockdowns in a month,4469.84,2.399
and the idea is very simple,4472.239,1.601
vaccinate,4473.84,1.28
all,4475.12,1.44
vulnerable people,4476.56,2.56
and then,4479.12,0.96
open up open up right uh and the idea,4480.08,2.32
was that uh the the lockdown harms this,4482.4,2.24
is related this is directly related to,4484.64,1.28
the great barrington declaration the,4485.92,1.04
great antarctic clergy said the lockdown,4486.96,2.08
harms are devastating,4489.04,2.0
to the population at large,4491.04,2.159
there's this,4493.199,1.361
considerable segment of people that are,4494.56,1.52
vulnerable,4496.08,1.119
protect them well with the vaccine we,4497.199,1.841
have a perfect tool to protect the,4499.04,1.6
vulnerable which is i still believe i,4500.64,2.0
mean is true right you vaccinate the,4502.64,2.88
vulnerable the older population and as,4505.52,2.08
you said there's a tenfold decrease in,4507.6,1.68
the mortality risk,4509.28,1.6
um from getting infected,4510.88,2.16
which is i mean amazing so that was the,4513.04,2.32
strategy we got we outlined what,4515.36,2.0
happened is that the vaccine debate got,4517.36,2.319
transformed so first there's so you're,4519.679,2.081
asking about vaccine hesitance i think,4521.76,1.2
there's there's first there's like,4522.96,1.12
there's there's the inherent,4524.08,2.079
limitations of how to measure vaccine,4526.159,2.401
safety right so we talked about a little,4528.56,1.76
bit about the trial but also after the,4530.32,2.16
trial there's a there's a there's a,4532.48,1.679
mechanism and this is the work i've been,4534.159,2.08
involved with before covet on,4536.239,2.641
on tracking and and identifying and,4538.88,2.799
checking whether the vaccines actually,4541.679,1.761
are safe and the central challenge is,4543.44,1.759
one of causality,4545.199,1.841
so you no longer have the randomized,4547.04,1.44
trial,4548.48,1.92
but but you want to know is the vaccine,4550.4,2.24
when is deployed at scale,4552.64,2.0
causing,4554.64,1.039
adverse events,4555.679,2.081
well you can't just look at people who,4557.76,1.52
are vaccinated and see what adverse,4559.28,1.439
events happen,4560.719,1.201
because you don't know what would have,4561.92,1.12
happened if the person had not been,4563.04,2.08
vaccinated,4565.12,1.76
so you have to have some control group,4566.88,2.88
now what happened is there's several,4569.76,1.68
systems to do to check this in that the,4571.44,2.239
cdc uses one one very very very commonly,4573.679,2.881
known one now is called vares the,4576.56,1.599
vaccine adverse event reporting system,4578.159,2.321
there anyone who has an adverse event,4580.48,2.16
that either either a regular person or a,4582.64,1.84
doctor can just go report look i have,4584.48,2.56
the vaccine and two days later i had a,4587.04,1.44
headache or whatever it is,4588.48,2.16
the person died,4590.64,1.28
a day after the vaccine right um now you,4591.92,2.72
vaccinate that the vaccine was rolled,4594.64,1.519
out to older people first,4596.159,2.481
and older people die sometimes with or,4598.64,2.559
without the vaccine so,4601.199,1.841
sometimes you'll see someone's,4603.04,1.04
vaccinated and a few days later they die,4604.08,2.48
did the vaccine cause it or something,4606.56,1.52
else cause it's really difficult to tell,4608.08,2.079
in order to tell you need a control,4610.159,1.441
group,4611.6,1.84
for that um,4613.44,1.759
there are other systems the fda and cdc,4615.199,2.161
have,4617.36,0.799
uh like there's one called vsd vaccine,4618.159,2.401
safety data link there's another system,4620.56,2.32
called best,4622.88,1.2
uh,4624.08,0.8
i forget the app with the acronym is to,4624.88,2.56
essentially to track uh cohorts of,4627.44,2.719
people,4630.159,1.201
vaccinated versus unvaccinated was as,4631.36,2.879
careful of matching as you can do it's,4634.239,1.44
not randomized but and then c,4635.679,2.641
if you have,4638.32,1.76
safety signals that pop up in the,4640.08,2.639
vaccinated relative to the control group,4642.719,1.921
unvaccinated,4644.64,1.68
um and so that's for instance how the,4646.32,2.8
the the myocarditis risk was picked up,4649.12,2.72
in young young especially young men,4651.84,2.24
it's also how the,4654.08,1.92
higher risk of blood clots in middle age,4656.0,2.96
and older women in with the jnj vaccine,4658.96,2.96
is picked,4661.92,0.92
up there what you have is are situations,4662.84,3.48
where the baseline risk of these,4666.32,2.24
outcomes are so low that if you see them,4668.56,2.88
in the con in the vaccinated arm at all,4671.44,2.56
then it's not hard to understand that,4674.0,1.44
the vaccine did this right,4675.44,1.92
young men should not be having,4677.36,1.52
myocarditis,4678.88,1.6
middle-aged women should not be having,4680.48,1.679
huge blood clots in the brain right um,4682.159,2.08
so when you see that you can say it's,4684.239,1.281
linked now the rates are low so young,4685.52,2.24
men maybe one in five thousand one in,4687.76,2.0
ten thousand of the vaccine of my,4689.76,2.0
vaccine-related myocarditis pericarditis,4691.76,2.56
um young women of middle-aged women i,4694.32,2.879
don't know i don't i'm not sure what the,4697.199,1.681
right number might be but like i'd say,4698.88,1.359
it's like in the you know one in,4700.239,2.0
hundreds of thousands something like,4702.239,1.761
that,4704.0,2.32
so these are rare outcomes but they're,4706.32,1.839
they're they are vaccinating linked,4708.159,1.52
outcomes,4709.679,1.201
how do you deal with that as a messaging,4710.88,2.56
thing i think you just tell people you,4713.44,1.92
tell people here are the risks you,4715.36,1.359
transparently tell them and just you're,4716.719,1.52
not you're not they're so they're not,4718.239,0.96
getting into something that they don't,4719.199,1.121
know,4720.32,0.72
yeah and um don't treat people like,4721.04,3.28
their children and need to be told lies,4724.32,2.879
because they won't understand the full,4727.199,1.681
complexity of the truth uh people i,4728.88,2.64
think are pretty good at um or actually,4731.52,4.56
you know,4736.08,0.96
people with time are good at,4737.04,1.52
understanding data but better than,4738.56,2.08
anything they're uh,4740.64,2.32
they're better at they're extremely good,4742.96,2.4
at detecting arrogance and and,4745.36,3.52
yeah give them either one of those i,4748.88,1.839
mean i'll give you one that's where i,4750.719,1.44
think it's greatly undermined vaccine,4752.159,1.761
has,4753.92,1.04
greatly undermined the demand for the,4754.96,1.199
vaccine is this weird denial that if you,4756.159,3.281
recover from kovid you have extremely,4759.44,2.16
good,4761.6,1.52
immunity both against infection and,4763.12,2.079
actually exchange,4765.199,1.761
and that denial,4766.96,2.239
leads to people distrusting the message,4769.199,2.561
given by like the cdc director for,4771.76,1.68
instance favored the vaccine,4773.44,2.16
right why would you deny a thing that's,4775.6,2.4
such an obvious fact it's like you can,4778.0,1.84
look at the data and it just i mean it,4779.84,2.56
just just pops out at you that people,4782.4,1.6
that are covered recovered,4784.0,1.679
are not getting infected again at very,4785.679,1.441
high rates,4787.12,1.52
much lower rates after these kinds of,4788.64,2.4
conversations um,4791.04,1.84
i'm sure after this com very,4792.88,1.52
conversation i often get uh a number of,4794.4,3.12
messages from joe joe rogan and from sam,4797.52,2.48
harris who to me are people i admire i,4800.0,3.6
think are really intelligent thoughtful,4803.6,1.76
human beings they also have a platform,4805.36,2.96
and i i i believe at least in my mind,4808.32,2.72
about this coveted,4811.04,1.92
set of topics they represent,4812.96,2.8
a group of people,4815.76,3.04
each group has,4819.76,1.919
smart,4821.679,1.601
thoughtful,4823.28,2.32
well-intentioned human beings and i,4825.6,2.48
don't know who is right,4828.08,2.079
but i i do know that they're kind of,4830.159,3.441
tribal a little bit,4833.6,2.0
uh those groups and so,4835.6,3.84
the question i want to ask is like what,4839.52,1.6
do you think about these,4841.12,2.32
uh two,4843.44,1.4
groups and this kind of tension over the,4844.84,3.0
vaccine,4847.84,1.92
that sometimes it just keeps finding,4849.76,1.919
different topics,4851.679,2.321
on which to focus on like whether kids,4854.0,2.08
should get vaccinated or not whether,4856.08,1.92
there should be vaccine mandates or not,4858.0,2.239
which seem to be often very kind of,4860.239,2.0
specific policy kinds of questions right,4862.239,2.641
it's the bigger picture i think it's a,4864.88,2.08
symptom of the distrust that people have,4866.96,1.92
in public health,4868.88,1.44
i think this kind of schism over the the,4870.32,2.879
vaccine does not happen in places where,4873.199,2.081
the public health authorities have been,4875.28,1.439
much more trustworthy,4876.719,1.841
right so you don't see this vaccine,4878.56,1.44
hasn't seen sweden for instance,4880.0,2.48
um,4882.48,1.199
what's happened in the united states is,4883.679,1.921
the vaccine has become,4885.6,3.28
first because of politics but then also,4889.04,1.92
because of the scientific arrogance this,4890.96,2.16
sort of touchstone issue and people line,4893.12,2.559
up on you on both sides of it and the,4895.679,1.761
different language you're hearing,4897.44,2.0
is structured around that so before the,4899.44,2.08
election for instance i did uh,4901.52,2.159
uh i was a i did a testimony in the,4903.679,2.321
house on on measurement of vaccine,4906.0,2.239
safety,4908.239,1.44
and i i was i was invited by the,4909.679,2.161
republicans there were i think uh four,4911.84,1.839
other experts invited by the democrats,4913.679,1.441
or three other experts invited by,4915.12,1.039
democrats,4916.159,1.281
each of whom had a lot of experience in,4917.44,1.759
measuring vaccine safety i was really,4919.199,2.161
surprised to hear them each,4921.36,2.72
doubt whether the fda would do a,4924.08,1.92
reasonable job in assessing vaccine,4926.0,1.6
safety,4927.6,1.039
including by people who have long,4928.639,2.0
records of working with the fda,4930.639,2.161
i mean these are,4932.8,1.68
professionals,4934.48,1.28
great scientists whose main you know,4935.76,2.64
sort of goal in life is to make sure,4938.4,1.44
that safe vaccine that that unsafe,4939.84,2.08
vaccines don't get released into the,4941.92,1.44
world and if they argue they get pulled,4943.36,2.879
and they're casting down on the vaccine,4946.239,2.161
the ability to track vaccine safety,4948.4,2.0
before the election,4950.4,2.88
and then after the election,4953.28,2.8
the the rhetoric switched on a dime,4956.08,2.96
right all of a sudden it's republicans,4959.04,1.76
that are cast as if they're vaccine,4960.8,1.76
hesitant,4962.56,1.2
that kind of political shift,4963.76,2.0
the public notices,4965.76,1.919
if if all it takes is an election to,4967.679,2.241
change how people talk about the safety,4969.92,1.759
of the vaccine well we're not talking,4971.679,1.841
science anymore many people think right,4973.52,2.08
i think that creates created its,4975.6,1.599
hesitancy,4977.199,1.921
the other thing i think the um,4979.12,2.4
the,4981.52,0.719
the hesitancy,4982.239,1.92
some politicians viewed it as a,4984.159,2.48
political,4986.639,1.121
as sort of like a political opportunity,4987.76,2.8
to sort of demonize people who were,4990.56,2.0
hesitant,4992.56,1.599
and that itself fueled hesitancy right,4994.159,2.48
like the if you're if you're telling me,4996.639,1.361
i'm a rube that just doesn't want the,4998.0,1.36
vaccine because i want everyone to die,4999.36,1.359
well i'm gonna i'm gonna react really,5000.719,1.92
negatively,5002.639,2.401
and if you're talking down to me,5005.04,2.48
about,5007.52,1.6
my legitimate,5009.12,1.599
you know sort of,5010.719,1.44
concerns about whether this vaccine's,5012.159,1.52
safe to i mean i've like heard from,5013.679,2.401
women who are thinking about getting,5016.08,1.119
pregnant should i take the vaccine i,5017.199,1.52
don't know i mean there are all kinds of,5018.719,1.44
questions,5020.159,0.961
legitimate questions that i think,5021.12,3.119
should have good data to answer that we,5024.239,1.761
don't necessarily have good data to,5026.0,1.12
answer so what do you do in the face of,5027.12,2.0
that,5029.12,0.96
well,5030.08,0.8
one reaction is to pretend like we we,5030.88,2.64
know for a fact that it's safe,5033.52,1.84
when we don't have the data to know for,5035.36,2.0
fact in that particular group with that,5037.36,1.279
particular set of clinical circumstances,5038.639,1.681
you know,5040.32,1.44
and that i think breeds hesitancy people,5041.76,2.16
can detect that um whereas if,5043.92,2.799
you just tell people you know i don't,5046.719,1.281
know,5048.0,1.199
yeah you deal with humility yeah you're,5049.199,1.761
gonna you're you'll end up with a better,5050.96,1.679
result,5052.639,1.841
let me ask you about i've recently had a,5054.48,2.0
conversation with the pfizer ceo,5056.48,3.04
this is,5059.52,2.4
part therapy session part advice because,5062.0,2.719
i again i really want,5064.719,3.52
us to get through this together and it,5068.239,1.761
feels like the division is a thing that,5070.0,1.84
uh prevents us from getting through this,5071.84,1.839
together,5073.679,1.52
and uh once again just like with francis,5075.199,2.881
collins a lot of people,5078.08,2.0
wrote to me,5080.08,2.0
words of support,5082.08,1.52
and a lot of people wrote to me words of,5083.6,2.639
criticism,5086.239,2.561
i'm trying to understand,5088.8,2.08
the nature of the criticism,5090.88,2.16
so some of the criticism had to do with,5093.04,3.199
against the vaccine and those kinds of,5096.239,1.841
things that i have a better,5098.08,1.68
understanding of,5099.76,2.32
but,5102.08,0.72
some kind of deep distrust,5102.8,2.56
of pfizer,5105.36,2.0
so,5107.36,1.04
um,5108.4,0.88
actually looking at uh big pharma,5109.28,2.56
broadly,5111.84,1.839
i'm trying to,5113.679,1.441
understand,5115.12,1.36
am i so naive,5116.48,3.04
that i just don't see it,5119.52,2.8
because yes there's corrupt people and,5122.32,2.399
they they're greedy they're flawed in,5124.719,2.801
all walks of life,5127.52,2.24
but uh companies,5129.76,2.8
do,5132.56,1.119
quite an incredible job of taking a good,5133.679,2.881
idea at the scale and making some money,5136.56,1.84
with that idea but they are the ones,5138.4,1.839
that achieve scale on a good idea,5140.239,3.041
i don't know,5143.28,1.439
it's not obvious to me i don't see,5144.719,3.121
where the manipulation is so the fear,5147.84,2.56
that people have and,5150.4,2.0
i talked to joe about this quite a bit i,5152.4,2.799
i think this is a legitimate fear and,5155.199,2.721
and a fury should often have that money,5157.92,2.799
has influenced disproportional influence,5160.719,2.401
especially in politics so the fear is,5163.12,2.64
that,5165.76,1.439
the policy,5167.199,1.361
of uh the vaccine was connected to the,5168.56,2.8
fact that,5171.36,1.2
lots of money could be made,5172.56,2.079
by manufacturing the vaccine,5174.639,2.801
and i understand that,5177.44,1.759
and i'm it's actually quite a heck of a,5179.199,1.921
difficult task to alleviate that concern,5181.12,3.28
like you really have to be a great man,5184.4,1.759
or woman or a leader to convince people,5186.159,2.961
that you're not full of that you're,5189.12,1.519
not just playing a game on them,5190.639,1.921
i don't know it's a it's a difficult,5192.56,2.159
task but at the same time i i really,5194.719,2.321
don't like the natural,5197.04,2.8
distrust every billionaire distrust,5199.84,2.56
everybody who's trying to make money,5202.4,1.68
because it feels like under a,5204.08,1.52
capitalistic system at least,5205.6,2.24
the the way to do a lot of good like to,5207.84,3.12
do good at scale in the world,5210.96,2.16
is by,5213.12,1.2
being at least in part motivated by the,5214.32,3.12
profit i mean i share your ambivalence,5217.44,1.6
right so on the one hand you have a a,5219.04,2.32
fantastic achievement the the the,5221.36,3.04
manufacture the discovery of the vaccine,5224.4,2.16
and then the manufacturing at scale,5226.56,2.24
so that,5228.8,1.359
you know billions of people can take the,5230.159,1.761
vaccine in a relatively short time that,5231.92,2.16
is a remarkable achievement that could,5234.08,1.84
not have happened without companies like,5235.92,2.4
pfizer,5238.32,1.6
um on the other hand the there is this,5239.92,2.4
sort of corrupting influence of that,5242.32,1.68
money,5244.0,1.199
uh uh just to give you one example uh,5245.199,2.0
there's a there's an enormous,5247.199,1.121
controversy over whether uh relatively,5248.32,2.399
inexpensive repurposed drugs can be used,5250.719,2.801
to treat the the the disease,5253.52,3.119
um,5256.639,1.681
none of no company like pfizer has any,5258.32,2.48
interest whatsoever in evaluating it,5260.8,2.08
even merck i think support was merck,5262.88,2.56
that,5265.44,1.12
had the patent on ivormectin,5266.56,2.32
uh now expired has no interest at all in,5268.88,2.88
checking to see if it works,5271.76,2.64
not only do they not have interest,5274.4,3.2
they have,5277.6,1.599
a way of talking about people who might,5279.199,2.96
have a little bit of interest,5282.159,2.241
that's again um fringe,5284.4,2.64
uh,5287.04,0.96
full of arrogance yeah,5288.0,2.239
and that that is what troubles me,5290.239,2.561
is there not a it's back to the play of,5292.8,2.24
science it's not they're not a bit of,5295.04,1.599
curiosity one okay one the natural,5296.639,2.721
curiosity of a human being that should,5299.36,1.6
always be there and an open mind is and,5300.96,2.48
second in the case of ivermectin and,5303.44,2.4
other things like that you have to,5305.84,2.0
acknowledge that there's a very large,5307.84,2.16
number of people,5310.0,1.44
who care about this topic and this is a,5311.44,2.799
way to inspire them to also play in the,5314.239,3.601
space of science to inspire them with,5317.84,1.6
science you can't just like dismiss,5319.44,2.239
everybody,5321.679,1.121
that uh you can't just dismiss people,5322.8,2.24
period yeah well i mean i think here,5325.04,2.0
here take ivermectin right there's,5327.04,1.44
actually a study,5328.48,2.0
funded by the nih by tony fauci's nia id,5330.48,3.759
and the nih,5334.239,1.281
um called active six,5335.52,2.639
that's,5338.159,0.801
a randomized trial of ivermectin,5338.96,3.679
it's due to be completed in march 2023,5342.639,4.481
so normally when you have uh private,5347.12,3.36
actors like these big,5350.48,1.759
drug companies that have no interest in,5352.239,2.48
conducting some kind of scientific,5354.719,1.44
experiment that would have some public,5356.159,1.281
benefit,5357.44,1.12
it's the job of the of the the,5358.56,1.76
government and in this case the nih to,5360.32,1.839
fund that kind of work the nih has been,5362.159,3.721
incredibly slow,5365.88,3.24
in its evaluations of these repurposed,5369.12,2.48
drugs,5371.6,1.2
and it's been left to lots of other,5372.8,1.68
private private private activities,5374.48,2.88
of uneven quality,5377.36,2.08
and hence that's why you have these,5379.44,1.44
these big fights,5380.88,1.359
because the data are not solid you're,5382.239,2.0
gonna have these big fights yeah but,5384.239,2.241
also okay forget the the process of,5386.48,2.64
science here the studies not enough,5389.12,2.8
effort being put into the studies just,5391.92,1.68
the way it's being communicated yeah no,5393.6,1.92
like horse pace i mean come on the fda,5395.52,2.639
put a tweet out telling people who are,5398.159,2.721
like,5400.88,0.799
they're taking iron mechanism because,5401.679,1.281
they've heard good things about it and,5402.96,1.199
they're sick and they're desperate and,5404.159,2.161
just call it horse pace was just that,5406.32,1.76
was that was terrible that was deeply,5408.08,2.159
responsible my hope um is grounded in,5410.239,3.041
the fact that young people see the the,5413.28,2.0
 of this young phd students,5415.28,2.399
graduate students young students in,5417.679,1.681
college they see,5419.36,2.08
the the,5421.44,2.719
less than stellar way that our,5424.159,2.161
scientific leaders and our political,5426.32,1.919
leaders are behaving and then the new,5428.239,1.681
generation will not repeat the mistakes,5429.92,2.239
of the past that is my hope because uh,5432.159,3.04
that that's the cool thing i see about,5435.199,1.601
young people is they they,5436.8,1.839
they're good at detecting and,5438.639,1.681
they they don't want to be part of that,5440.32,2.48
um that's my hope um in the space of,5442.8,2.64
science,5445.44,1.199
let me return to this idea of the great,5446.639,2.241
barrington declaration return to the,5448.88,2.48
beginning,5451.36,1.279
so um what are the basics can you,5452.639,2.241
describe what the great barrington,5454.88,1.52
declaration is what are some of the,5456.4,1.36
ideas in it you mentioned focused,5457.76,2.16
protection,5459.92,1.44
uh what are your concerns about,5461.36,2.0
lockdowns just paint the picture of this,5463.36,2.879
early proposal sure so uh the great,5466.239,2.161
painting declaration first why is it,5468.4,1.36
called great barrington declaration it,5469.76,1.68
sounds it's such a great name,5471.44,2.16
you,5473.6,0.88
i mean it just it's such an epic name,5474.48,2.239
but the the reason why it's called that,5476.719,1.841
is way less than epic it's it was it was,5478.56,2.4
because it the the conference um which,5480.96,3.04
is organized by martin kuldorf who's a,5484.0,1.76
was a professor at harvard university uh,5485.76,1.919
by a statistician he actually,5487.679,2.48
designed,5490.159,1.201
the the safety system the statistical,5491.36,2.24
system that the,5493.6,1.28
fda uses,5494.88,1.359
for,5496.239,0.801
tracking vaccine safety,5497.04,1.92
he,5498.96,0.719
and i had met previously just the summer,5499.679,2.641
before that summer,5502.32,2.319
and he invited me to come to this small,5504.639,2.401
conference where he was inviting me and,5507.04,1.679
sinatra gupta who was a professor of,5508.719,2.801
theoretical epidemiology at harvard,5511.52,2.159
at oxford university,5513.679,2.48
and i mean i jumped at the chance,5516.159,2.321
uh because i knew that martin and,5518.48,1.92
sinatra were both smarter than me and uh,5520.4,2.16
it would be fun to like talk about what,5522.56,2.0
uh what the right strategy would be,5524.56,2.56
on the drive in i didn't know what the,5527.12,2.16
name of the town was and i asked as they,5529.28,2.959
said was great barrington i had in the,5532.239,1.681
back of my head,5533.92,1.36
um martin and i arrived a little early,5535.28,2.16
and we were writing an op-ed about some,5537.44,2.239
of the ideas i hope we get to talk about,5539.679,1.281
very soon um about focus protection and,5540.96,3.04
the right strategy and uh when sinetra,5544.0,2.719
arrived we realized we actually come,5546.719,2.161
basically to the same place about the,5548.88,1.52
right,5550.4,0.88
way to deal with the epidemic,5551.28,2.48
um and i i thought well why don't we put,5553.76,2.479
issue why don't we write something like,5556.239,1.761
the port hearing statement that was what,5558.0,1.679
i had that in the back of my head yes,5559.679,1.681
and i'm like well what's the name of,5561.36,1.52
this town again it was great barrington,5562.88,1.759
yeah so it's not barrington,5564.639,2.08
it's great bear it's which is fantastic,5566.719,2.241
right,5568.96,1.04
it's so over the top that it's perfect,5570.0,2.719
it's it's,5572.719,1.041
literally like the big bang,5573.76,1.919
there's something about these,5575.679,1.04
over-the-top fun titles that just really,5576.719,2.321
deliver them,5579.04,1.44
so that's why that's my my main,5580.48,1.28
contribution was the word is the title,5581.76,1.84
the name great barrington decor um but,5583.6,2.32
yeah so it was it was kind of uh so the,5585.92,1.84
and the the idea is actually,5587.76,2.32
while the title is great um and i think,5590.08,2.159
that it was written in a very stylish,5592.239,1.361
way,5593.6,0.8
um it's you know like it's a go it's,5594.4,1.839
less than a page you can go look online,5596.239,1.92
and read it it's written written for,5598.159,2.641
not for scientists but for the general,5600.8,1.839
public so people can understand the,5602.639,1.52
ideas really simply,5604.159,2.641
but it is not actually a radical set of,5606.8,2.24
ideas it actually represents the old,5609.04,1.92
pandemic plans,5610.96,1.759
that we've used for century,5612.719,2.401
dealing with other similar pandemics,5615.12,3.119
um and and there's it's twofold uh first,5618.239,3.201
let me talk about the science it rests,5621.44,1.68
on and then i'll talk about the plan,5623.12,1.76
the science actually some of what we,5624.88,1.279
already talked about uh there's this,5626.159,2.0
massive age gradient in the risk of,5628.159,2.721
coven infection older people face much,5630.88,2.0
higher risk than younger people,5632.88,2.72
the second bit of science is all that's,5635.6,1.92
not controversial right that even if you,5637.52,1.6
think the ifr is 0.7 or or or 0.2 no,5639.12,2.88
matter what everyone thinks everyone,5642.0,1.679
agrees on this age gradient,5643.679,2.881
the second bit of science is also not,5646.56,1.52
controversial,5648.08,2.159
the lockdown focused policies that we,5650.239,2.081
followed,5652.32,1.04
have absolutely devastating consequences,5653.36,2.96
on the health of the population,5656.32,3.52
let me just give you some examples uh,5659.84,2.16
and this is this was known in october of,5662.0,1.52
2020 we wrote it right so um the un was,5663.52,3.04
sounding alarms that there would be,5666.56,3.04
tens of millions of people who would,5669.6,2.639
starve as a consequence of the economic,5672.239,2.4
dislocation caused by the lockdowns,5674.639,2.641
and that's come to pass,5677.28,1.439
hundreds of thousands of children in,5678.719,2.081
places like south asia dead from,5680.8,1.76
starvation,5682.56,2.639
as a consequence of lockdowns,5685.199,3.121
um,5688.32,0.879
the the the the uh uh,5689.199,2.801
priorities like,5692.0,2.0
the treatment of patients with,5694.0,1.119
tuberculosis,5695.119,1.52
in poor countries stopped,5696.639,2.321
because of lockdowns,5698.96,2.08
uh,5701.04,0.88
childhood vaccinations of,5701.92,2.0
measles rubella,5703.92,1.92
dpt diphtheria so on pertussis tetanus,5705.84,3.44
all those standard vaccination campaigns,5709.28,2.72
stopped,5712.0,1.199
tens of millions of children skipping,5713.199,2.161
these doses,5715.36,1.44
for diseases that are actually deadly,5716.8,2.0
for them,5718.8,1.6
is there just a on a small tangent,5720.4,3.04
is it well understood to you what are,5723.44,2.48
the mechanisms that stop all those,5725.92,1.759
things because of lockdowns is it some,5727.679,2.0
aspect of supply chain is it just,5729.679,2.081
literally because,5731.76,1.359
hospital doors are closed,5733.119,1.921
is it because there's a disincentive to,5735.04,2.48
go outside by people even when they,5737.52,2.08
deeply need help it's all of the above,5739.6,2.639
uh but a lot of those efforts especially,5742.239,2.081
especially those like vaccination,5744.32,1.12
efforts are funded and run by what,5745.44,3.279
western efforts like gavi is a,5748.719,2.561
i think it's a gates funded thing,5751.28,1.28
actually that produce provides vaccines,5752.56,2.559
for you know millions of kids worldwide,5755.119,2.961
and those efforts were scaled back,5758.08,3.039
malaria prevention efforts so in the,5761.119,2.321
developing world it was a devastating,5763.44,2.56
effect these lockdowns um there was also,5766.0,2.48
direct effects like in india the,5768.48,2.159
uh the lockdowns when they first,5770.639,1.761
instituted there was an order that 10,5772.4,2.56
million migrant workers,5774.96,2.239
who live in big cities and they live,5777.199,2.0
hand-to-mouth they buy you know coconuts,5779.199,2.721
they sell the coconuts with the money,5781.92,1.68
they buy food for themselves and,5783.6,1.36
coconuts for the next day to sell um,5784.96,3.199
walk back to their villages or get or,5788.159,2.08
get go back to their villages then,5790.239,2.321
overnight so 10 million people walking,5792.56,2.4
back to their villages or taking a train,5794.96,1.6
back a thousand died on route,5796.56,2.4
overcrowded trains dying essentially on,5798.96,2.239
the side of the road i mean it was it,5801.199,1.281
was absolutely inhumane policy,5802.48,3.28
uh and uh the lockdowns there,5805.76,3.52
what what it's it's actually it's kind,5809.28,2.32
of like what's happened to the west as,5811.6,1.2
well but it was so severe uh there was a,5812.8,2.96
zero prevalence study done in mumbai by,5815.76,2.8
a friend of mine at the university of,5818.56,1.04
chicago what he found was that in the,5819.6,2.0
slums of mumbai,5821.6,1.84
there were 70 surah prevalence in july,5823.44,2.32
or august of seven of sept of 2020,5825.76,2.8
whereas in the rest of mumbai is 20,5828.56,2.72
yeah right so it was incredibly unequal,5831.28,2.24
the the lockdowns protected the the,5833.52,2.719
relatively well off and spread the,5836.239,2.241
disease,5838.48,1.04
among the poor,5839.52,2.24
um so uh that's in the developing world,5841.76,3.6
in the developed world the health,5845.36,1.12
effects of lockdowns were,5846.48,2.4
also quite bad,5848.88,1.839
right so we talked already about,5850.719,1.361
isolation and depression there was a,5852.08,2.32
study done in july of 2020,5854.4,3.12
that found that one in four young adults,5857.52,3.679
seriously considered suicide,5861.199,2.0
now suicide rates haven't like spiked up,5863.199,3.681
so much but the depths of despair that,5866.88,2.96
would lead somebody to seriously,5869.84,2.08
consider suicide itself should be should,5871.92,2.239
be a source of great concern for in,5874.159,2.241
public health,5876.4,1.279
yeah this is one of the troubling things,5877.679,2.321
about measuring well-being is,5880.0,3.04
we're okay at measuring death and,5883.04,1.84
suicide,5884.88,1.2
we're not so good at measuring suffering,5886.08,2.72
it's like people talk about,5888.8,2.64
um maybe even,5891.44,1.84
harder more in the under stalin or the,5893.28,3.68
concentration camps with hitler we talk,5896.96,2.8
about deaths,5899.76,1.439
but we don't talk about,5901.199,1.681
the suffering over periods of years,5902.88,3.2
by people living in fear by people,5906.08,2.079
starving,5908.159,1.201
psychological trauma that lasts a,5909.36,2.319
lifetime all of those things,5911.679,2.161
i mean and just to get back to that that,5913.84,1.76
point we close schools especially in,5915.6,2.32
blue states we close schools,5917.92,2.08
now richer parents could send their kids,5920.0,2.159
to private schools many of which stayed,5922.159,1.52
open even in the blue states they could,5923.679,1.52
get pods they could get tutors but,5925.199,2.081
that's not true for for poorer and,5927.28,2.08
middle class parents,5929.36,2.319
and as a result what we did is we took,5931.679,2.48
away life opportunities for kids we we,5934.159,1.921
tried to teach,5936.08,1.52
five-year-olds to read via zoom in,5937.6,1.84
kindergarten,5939.44,1.759
right uh,5941.199,1.52
and uh the consequence actually you,5942.719,2.0
think okay we can just make it up but,5944.719,1.52
it's really difficult to make that up,5946.239,2.721
there's a literature in health economics,5948.96,2.719
that shows that even uh,5951.679,2.241
you know,5953.92,0.88
relatively small disruptions in,5954.8,2.64
schooling can have lifelong consequences,5957.44,2.719
negative consequences for kids,5960.159,2.0
right so they end up growing up poorer,5962.159,3.201
they they lead shorter lives and less,5965.36,2.08
healthy lives,5967.44,1.279
as a consequence that's and that's what,5968.719,1.681
the literature now shows is likely to,5970.4,1.839
happen with the interruptions of,5972.239,2.241
schooling that we had in the united,5974.48,1.6
states many european countries actually,5976.08,1.68
managed to avoid this there were in the,5977.76,1.84
early days the epidemic great,5979.6,1.68
indications that children first were not,5981.28,2.24
very severe severely at risk from covet,5983.52,2.08
itself,5985.6,0.96
nor are they super spreaders,5986.56,2.48
schools were not the source of community,5989.04,2.079
spread communities spread spread,5991.119,2.641
the disease to schools not the other way,5993.76,1.6
around,5995.36,1.92
um and if we can talk about the,5997.28,1.04
scientific basis of that if you'd like,5998.32,1.52
but that was pretty well known even in,5999.84,2.24
october,6002.08,1.039
um it that we we closed hospitals in,6003.119,2.56
order to keep them,6005.679,1.761
like available to covet patients but as,6007.44,2.4
a result,6009.84,1.12
women skipped breast cancer screening,6010.96,3.12
as a result they have are showing up,6014.08,1.599
with,6015.679,0.721
late stage breast cancer that should,6016.4,1.2
have been picked up last year,6017.6,1.92
men and women skipped colon cancer,6019.52,1.679
screening again with later stage disease,6021.199,2.321
that should have been picked up last,6023.52,1.04
year with earlier stage for patients,6024.56,2.079
with diabetes,6026.639,2.241
it's very important to have regular,6028.88,1.52
screening for blood sugar levels,6030.4,2.719
and and sort of counseling for lifestyle,6033.119,2.641
improvement and we skipped that,6035.76,2.32
people stayed home with heart attacks,6038.08,1.52
and died at home with heart attacks,6039.6,3.68
so you had this like sort of wide range,6043.28,2.32
of medical,6045.6,1.68
and psychological harms,6047.28,2.32
that were being utterly ignored,6049.6,2.16
as a result of the lockdowns,6051.76,2.08
plus there's the economic pain,6053.84,3.359
so like you said the,6057.199,2.161
whatever is a good term for the,6059.36,1.319
non-laptop class,6060.679,2.52
people would lose their jobs yes there,6063.199,2.241
might be in the in the western world,6065.44,1.679
support for them,6067.119,1.6
financially but the the big loss there,6068.719,2.641
that is perhaps correlated with the,6071.36,2.319
depression and suicide is uh,6073.679,2.881
loss of meaning loss of hope for the,6076.56,2.159
future a loss of kind of a sense of,6078.719,3.041
stability all the pride you have and,6081.76,2.479
being able to um,6084.239,3.121
make,6087.52,1.44
money that allows you to pave your own,6088.96,2.32
way in the world,6091.28,1.359
and yes just having less money than,6092.639,2.161
you're used to so your family your kids,6094.8,2.08
are suffering all those kinds of things,6096.88,1.359
and there's a there's again an economics,6098.239,1.92
literature on this on deaths of despair,6100.159,2.48
it was called 2009 there was the the,6102.639,2.401
great recession it led to an enormous,6105.04,2.4
uptick in overdose from drugs,6107.44,2.88
uh suicidality depression,6110.32,2.96
as a result of the job losses that,6113.28,1.839
happened during the great recession,6115.119,2.241
well that's happening again like an,6117.36,2.0
enormous increase,6119.36,1.68
in drug overdoses,6121.04,2.88
that's not uh that's not a an accident,6123.92,2.48
that's a lockdown harm right same same,6126.4,1.92
thing with uh with the job losses the,6128.32,2.16
job losses by the way are like it's so,6130.48,1.759
interesting because the um the states,6132.239,2.4
that stayed open have had,6134.639,1.841
much much lower unemployment than the,6136.48,2.08
states that stayed closed,6138.56,1.679
uh the labor force participation rates,6140.239,2.081
declined by three percent it's women,6142.32,1.76
that separated because,6144.08,2.079
they stayed home with their kids um,6146.159,2.241
we've reversed a generation of women uh,6148.4,3.52
when,6151.92,1.759
proving women's participation in the,6153.679,1.761
labor force,6155.44,1.52
do you think,6156.96,2.159
it has to do with institutions that,6159.119,2.721
we mentioned that there is so much,6161.84,1.44
priority given or so much power given to,6163.28,2.64
maybe nih,6165.92,2.319
versus um,6168.239,1.681
other civilian leaders or do people just,6169.92,2.88
not care about the economic pain the,6172.8,1.68
leaders i mean uh because to me it was,6174.48,3.44
obvious,6177.92,1.279
i mean probably it's just studying,6179.199,2.721
history,6181.92,1.52
whenever i listen to people on twitter,6183.44,2.96
on mainstream news or just anything,6186.4,4.48
i realize that's the very kind of top,6190.88,3.359
the the people that have a voice,6194.239,2.96
represent a tiny selection of people and,6197.199,2.401
so whenever there's hard times i always,6199.6,2.8
kind of think about the the quiet,6202.4,3.2
the voiceless,6205.6,1.519
the quiet suffering of the tens of,6207.119,2.321
millions of the hundreds of millions,6209.44,2.719
um,6212.159,1.52
do the political leaders not just give a,6213.679,2.081
damn i mean i think it was actually a,6215.76,2.0
very odd ethical thing at the beginning,6217.76,2.32
of the pandemic where if you brought up,6220.08,2.24
economic harms at all,6222.32,1.839
you were seen as callous,6224.159,3.121
right so i i i had a reporter calling me,6227.28,2.56
up almost the very beginning of the,6229.84,1.2
epidemic asking me about about the about,6231.04,2.48
uh,6233.52,0.8
uh,6234.32,0.96
like a very particular phenomenon so,6235.28,1.76
like uh he he was anticipating a rise in,6237.04,2.88
child abuse because children were gonna,6239.92,1.52
be staying at home child abuse is,6241.44,1.279
generally picked up at school,6242.719,2.161
and that actually happened like so like,6244.88,1.359
the the child reported child abuse,6246.239,1.761
dropped but actual child abuse increased,6248.0,2.719
um,6250.719,0.96
because normally you pick up the child,6251.679,1.681
abuse at school and that you apparently,6253.36,1.52
you have the intervention right so yeah,6254.88,1.92
so i was talking about like well there's,6256.8,1.28
gonna be some economic harms and they're,6258.08,1.119
going to have health consequences but,6259.199,0.96
the economic harms matter but the but,6260.159,2.641
he's he he counseled me and i think he,6262.8,2.64
was he had his bet my best interest at,6265.44,1.679
heart like if if we were to put that in,6267.119,1.6
the story i would be i'd essentially be,6268.719,2.0
canceled because the what the what the,6270.719,2.081
uh the the narrative that that arose in,6272.8,2.64
march of 2020 is if you if you care,6275.44,2.239
about money at all,6277.679,1.921
you're evil and crass if you you must,6279.6,2.0
only care about lives,6281.6,2.16
the problem with that narrative is that,6283.76,1.76
that money which we're talking about is,6285.52,2.4
is actually lives of poor people,6287.92,3.279
right when you throw 100 million people,6291.199,2.721
around the world into into poverty,6293.92,2.0
you're going to see enormous harm to,6295.92,2.16
their health enormous increases in their,6298.08,2.0
in their mortality it's not immoral to,6300.08,2.24
think about that and and worry about,6302.32,1.68
that,6304.0,0.88
in the context of this pandemic response,6304.88,2.319
our mind focused so much on kovid that,6307.199,3.121
it forgot that there are so many other,6310.32,1.76
public health priorities as well that,6312.08,1.52
need our attention desperately and this,6313.6,3.039
is the thing i,6316.639,2.56
sensed about san francisco when i,6319.199,2.161
visited i was thinking of moving there,6321.36,1.6
for startup,6322.96,1.52
this is the thing i'm really afraid of,6324.48,2.0
especially if i have any,6326.48,2.96
effect on the world through a startup is,6329.44,2.32
losing touch in this kind of way,6331.76,2.56
that uh you mentioned the laptop class,6334.32,2.96
um,6337.28,0.8
living in this world where you're only,6338.08,1.599
concerned about this particular,6339.679,2.48
of class of people and also,6342.159,3.441
uh you know perhaps in early on in the,6345.6,2.559
pandemic amongst the laptop class there,6348.159,1.921
was a legitimate concern for health like,6350.08,2.0
you're not sure,6352.08,1.52
how deadly this virus is you don't,6353.6,2.24
you're not sure who to listen to so,6355.84,1.44
there's a real concern,6357.28,1.52
and then at a certain point when the,6358.8,1.68
data starts coming in you start becoming,6360.48,2.88
more and more detached from the data you,6363.36,1.759
don't start carrying less and less and,6365.119,2.08
you start just,6367.199,1.44
swimming in the space of narratives like,6368.639,2.241
existing the space of narratives and you,6370.88,1.6
have this narrative,6372.48,1.36
in san francisco in the laptop class,6373.84,3.04
that you just are very uh proud that you,6376.88,3.279
know the truth you're the sole,6380.159,1.52
possessors of the truth you congratulate,6381.679,2.0
yourself on it and you don't care what,6383.679,2.48
actually,6386.159,1.121
gigantic detrimental effect it has on,6387.28,1.839
society because,6389.119,1.52
you're mostly,6390.639,1.681
fine,6392.32,1.6
that i'm so terrified of that,6393.92,2.719
well i think the answer to that is just,6396.639,2.0
to,6398.639,0.961
you remember,6399.6,0.88
yeah yeah,6400.48,1.28
i don't think um you know remember where,6401.76,1.52
you came from remember who who who,6403.28,1.839
you're doing is for at the back of your,6405.119,1.921
head should always be what's what's the,6407.04,1.679
purpose like why am i here what's the,6408.719,2.241
purpose of this and if i'm if if the,6410.96,2.08
purpose is simply,6413.04,2.36
self-aggrandizement then you should,6415.4,1.719
rethink because it'll just end up being,6417.119,1.761
a hall of life,6418.88,2.16
all of us will be forgotten in the end,6421.04,3.76
focus protection,6424.8,1.76
the idea the policy what is focus,6426.56,2.48
protection right so those i was saying,6429.04,1.92
that there's two scientific bases right,6430.96,2.08
so one is this the steep age gradient,6433.04,2.0
the second is the existence of locked,6435.04,1.679
arms again i think there's not very,6436.719,1.44
little disagreement in the scientific,6438.159,1.441
community of both of those facts,6439.6,2.639
if you put those facts together,6442.239,2.321
the obvious policy is to protect the,6444.56,2.8
people who are at the most severe risk,6447.36,2.08
from the disease itself,6449.44,2.08
and that's the idea of focus protection,6451.52,1.44
that's the general principle of it,6452.96,2.159
the actual implementation of it depends,6455.119,2.721
on the living circumstances of the,6457.84,2.0
people that are at risk,6459.84,1.68
the resources are available in the,6461.52,1.44
community uh the the uh the technology,6462.96,3.52
is available to do this,6466.48,2.8
and so it's almost always going to be in,6469.28,2.56
fact it'll always be a local thing,6471.84,2.879
because it'll depend on the the the all,6474.719,2.48
of those those things which are all,6477.199,1.44
local in nature,6478.639,1.52
right so one very very obvious thing in,6480.159,3.201
a country like ours where so many older,6483.36,2.56
people live in institutionalized,6485.92,1.759
settings in nursing home settings,6487.679,2.721
and that's where older really vulnerable,6490.4,2.56
chronically ill patients often live,6492.96,2.719
it is and you know this disease affects,6495.679,2.0
that group most like most most commonly,6497.679,2.081
it is absolutely vital to protect that,6499.76,2.16
group,6501.92,1.199
um we should have known that in february,6503.119,2.56
2020 from just from the chinese data,6505.679,4.081
and,6510.159,0.721
we should have thought about that group,6510.88,2.239
as the as this as the key constraint,6513.119,3.12
in our policy making,6516.239,2.0
um instead we thought about in february,6518.239,2.48
march 2020 as hospital beds as the key,6520.719,2.881
constraint,6523.6,1.2
hospital beds and ventilator shortages,6524.8,2.0
and that we so we we ran around trying,6526.8,2.24
to like address that,6529.04,2.079
constraint you know like a linear,6531.119,1.681
programming problem you figure out what,6532.8,1.12
the which constraints binding and you,6533.92,1.52
address that one thing and then you go,6535.44,1.36
to the next one right um if that's it's,6536.8,2.72
that one constraint we said okay the,6539.52,1.679
constraint is hospital beds,6541.199,3.04
that led to the decision in many of the,6544.239,2.88
northeast states to send,6547.119,2.481
covet infected patients who were on on,6549.6,2.0
the verge of like it looked like they,6551.6,1.519
were about to recover back to nursing,6553.119,2.161
homes,6555.28,1.919
who then spread the disease all through,6557.199,1.761
there because they wanted to preserve,6558.96,1.12
the hospital beds,6560.08,1.68
well for somebody who loves the miracle,6561.76,2.56
optimization i love the way you frame,6564.32,1.76
this,6566.08,1.76
but those are kind of connected right if,6567.84,2.56
you actually focus on protecting the,6570.4,2.16
vulnerable you will also,6572.56,2.8
have the effect of,6575.36,2.08
not,6577.44,0.799
hitting the ceiling of the available,6578.239,2.161
that is that's the irony if we protected,6580.4,2.239
the vulnerable the vulnerable the most,6582.639,2.56
likely to be hospitalized and so by,6585.199,2.321
protecting the hospital about protecting,6587.52,1.76
the vulnerable we would also have,6589.28,2.24
addressed the shortage of hospital,6591.52,1.199
that's more effectively so that little,6592.719,1.841
shift in priority would have had a big,6594.56,2.0
impact,6596.56,1.039
okay but specifically the idea is to,6597.599,4.0
and we could talk about different ideas,6601.599,1.921
of how to actually do this but uh you,6603.52,2.159
know you,6605.679,1.681
basically do a lockdown or something,6607.36,2.08
like that on a very small set i mean you,6609.44,2.96
may have to do that if it's community,6612.4,1.6
spread is very high but generally i,6614.0,1.52
think,6615.52,1.679
it would depend on again the living,6617.199,1.52
circumstances and the uh so so for,6618.719,1.841
instance um,6620.56,1.679
if you are in a if you have a here's a,6622.239,2.4
very simple idea that doesn't require a,6624.639,1.361
lockdown,6626.0,1.44
forced on them i i don't actually,6627.44,1.44
generally are not in favor of that kind,6628.88,1.359
of force lockdown because you just won't,6630.239,1.281
get cooperation,6631.52,1.84
um but what you could do is provide,6633.36,1.68
resources to,6635.04,1.92
that group of people so like ima imagine,6636.96,2.159
you live next door to somebody uh an,6639.119,2.401
older couple,6641.52,1.679
um and it's there's high community,6643.199,1.761
spread,6644.96,1.279
well they have to go grocery shopping,6646.239,2.241
um we did like some of these some,6648.48,1.6
communities did these like senior only,6650.08,1.76
grocery hour right but but they have to,6651.84,2.319
still have to go out and they might get,6654.159,1.52
exposed in when they're shopping amongst,6655.679,2.081
other seniors yeah,6657.76,1.68
well why not organized home delivery of,6659.44,2.56
groceries to them we did that for the,6662.0,2.0
laptop class,6664.0,1.679
right uh or or you can even just there's,6665.679,2.0
a volunteer effort you know the older,6667.679,1.601
people living next door just call them,6669.28,1.359
up and say can i help you get uh go out,6670.639,1.921
and go shopping for it and so you would,6672.56,1.599
have potentially,6674.159,1.44
federal support of that kind of thing so,6675.599,1.921
these kinds of efforts and identify,6677.52,2.56
where the vulnerable people live uh it's,6680.08,2.159
really challenging in multi-generational,6682.239,1.92
homes in l.a county for instance there's,6684.159,1.44
a lot of,6685.599,1.921
older people living together with,6687.52,1.28
younger people in relatively crowded,6688.8,2.72
they're they're it's really quite a,6691.52,1.84
challenge but there again you can use,6693.36,1.68
resources so if grandma uh,6695.04,3.36
is worried that grandson has come home,6698.4,2.239
but is potentially been exposed grandson,6700.639,1.6
calls grandma says i've been i might,6702.239,1.521
have been at a party where i might do,6703.76,1.439
that where covid was grandma calls,6705.199,2.48
public health public health and then,6707.679,1.361
says okay you can have this hotel room,6709.04,1.52
for a couple of days,6710.56,1.28
until you check to turn negatives in,6711.84,2.56
case it wasn't clear,6714.4,1.6
the idea of focus protection,6716.0,2.56
is the people that are,6718.56,2.28
vulnerable protect them,6720.84,2.12
and everybody else goes on with their,6722.96,2.239
lives open up the economy just do as it,6725.199,3.44
was before and there was still fear,6728.639,1.841
abroad so there still would be some,6730.48,1.679
restrictions people would pose on,6732.159,1.361
themselves they probably would go to,6733.52,1.52
parties less the grandsons probably,6735.04,1.52
wouldn't go so many parties right um uh,6736.56,2.32
that there would be less,6738.88,1.68
less participation in big gatherings uh,6740.56,2.8
you may even save like big gatherings in,6743.36,1.759
order to restrict community spread again,6745.119,2.161
i'm not against any of that,6747.28,2.0
but you shouldn't be closing businesses,6749.28,2.399
you shouldn't be closing churches and,6751.679,1.601
synagogues you shouldn't be closing you,6753.28,1.76
shouldn't be forcing people to not go to,6755.04,2.72
to school you should,6757.76,1.52
you should not be shuttering businesses,6759.28,1.919
you should just let,6761.199,1.281
just allow society to go on some disease,6762.48,2.48
will spread but as we've seen the,6764.96,1.92
lockdown didn't stop the disease from,6766.88,1.279
spreading anyways,6768.159,1.841
right so what do you make of the,6770.0,1.84
criticism that this idea like,6771.84,3.92
all good ideas,6775.76,1.76
cannot actually be implemented in a,6777.52,2.32
heterogeneous society where there's a,6779.84,1.839
lot of people intermixing,6781.679,1.92
and,6783.599,0.961
once you open it up people like the the,6784.56,3.039
younger people will just forget that,6787.599,1.761
this is even existing and they'll stop,6789.36,2.319
caring about the older people and mess,6791.679,1.601
up the whole thing and the government,6793.28,1.76
will not want to fund,6795.04,1.679
any kind of the great efforts you're,6796.719,1.52
talking about about food delivery and,6798.239,1.681
then the food delivery services be like,6799.92,2.239
why the heck am i helping out on this,6802.159,1.761
anyway because like it's not making me,6803.92,2.0
much money and so therefore like all,6805.92,2.16
good ideas it will collapse,6808.08,2.32
that might be true i mean i think it's,6810.4,1.839
always a risk with policy thing but i,6812.239,1.841
think like think back to the moment,6814.08,3.2
we actually felt like we were in this,6817.28,1.28
together to some extent yes,6818.56,2.159
right i think i think that that um that,6820.719,2.561
empathy that we had that was used to,6823.28,2.0
like,6825.28,2.24
tell people to stay in and like happily,6827.52,2.56
not don't rule in happily but like stay,6830.08,1.68
in,6831.76,0.879
um to to like wear a mask or to to do,6832.639,2.881
all these things that we thought would,6835.52,1.76
help other people,6837.28,1.439
could have been redirected to actually,6838.719,1.681
helping the people who most needed to be,6840.4,2.4
especially,6842.8,1.2
i do remember,6844.0,0.87
[Music],6844.87,1.97
march uh so this is even way before,6846.84,3.0
barrington all that kind of stuff,6849.84,2.799
march april may,6852.639,2.08
there was a feeling like if if we all,6854.719,2.321
just work together,6857.04,1.599
yeah we'll solve this right and that,6858.639,2.48
maybe started to when did that start,6861.119,2.161
breaking down i mean the,6863.28,2.0
unfortunately the election is mixed into,6865.28,2.319
this yeah that it became politicized but,6867.599,3.361
i think it lasted quite a long time i,6870.96,1.92
think into the summer i think there was,6872.88,1.52
some some of that sense uh i don't know,6874.4,2.64
they're obviously varied among different,6877.04,1.36
people but um,6878.4,1.279
but i think that it's true it would have,6879.679,1.92
been challenging it's also true that,6881.599,1.761
it's heterogeneous exactly the way you,6883.36,2.239
said um but what that means is you need,6885.599,2.321
a local response,6887.92,1.84
a response so like like my vision of a,6889.76,2.64
public health officer is someone that,6892.4,1.6
understands their community,6894.0,2.48
not not necessarily the nation at large,6896.48,1.679
but their community and then works,6898.159,2.08
within their community to figure out how,6900.239,1.761
to deploy the resources that have,6902.0,1.599
available,6903.599,1.441
um to do the kind of protection policies,6905.04,2.32
we're talking about that's that's what,6907.36,1.44
should have happened instead they spent,6908.8,2.16
a huge amount of efforts closing making,6910.96,2.4
sure businesses stayed closed,6913.36,2.08
businesses that,6915.44,1.36
i mean there were you know like hardware,6916.8,2.08
stores that closed,6918.88,1.839
what good did closing a hardware store,6920.719,1.761
do,6922.48,1.36
for the spreader club if it had an,6923.84,1.6
effect on spread covert spread i mean,6925.44,1.84
it's going to be checking to make sure,6927.28,1.52
that plexiglas was put up everywhere,6928.8,2.16
which now in retrospect turns out to,6930.96,1.52
have probably made the disease worse,6932.48,2.96
um,6935.44,1.44
you know masking enforcement,6936.88,2.08
so shaming around mask i mean a huge,6938.96,2.08
amount of effort on things that were,6941.04,2.8
only tangentially related to focus,6943.84,2.24
protection what if we turned our energy,6946.08,3.039
that enormous energy put into that,6949.119,3.04
instead into focused protection of the,6952.159,1.681
vulnerable that's essentially the,6953.84,1.279
conversation i was calling for,6955.119,1.841
and it wasn't i mean i didn't think of,6956.96,2.159
it as we had every single idea i mean we,6959.119,1.921
gave some concrete proposals,6961.04,2.0
and we got but the criticism we got was,6963.04,1.52
that those those concrete proposals,6964.56,1.52
weren't enough,6966.08,1.92
and the answer to that i have is that's,6968.0,1.84
true they weren't enough i wasn't,6969.84,1.6
thinking of them as enough i was,6971.44,1.279
thinking that they would i wanted to,6972.719,1.761
involve an enormous number of people in,6974.48,2.08
local public health to help think about,6976.56,2.88
how to do focus protection in their,6979.44,1.759
communities,6981.199,2.0
the question that's interesting here is,6983.199,2.721
about the future too,6985.92,2.96
uh so uh covet has very specific,6988.88,2.88
characteristics like you mentioned about,6991.76,1.6
the curve of the the the death rate,6993.36,2.799
based on the like it's it's uh it seems,6996.159,2.48
like with covid it's a little bit easier,6998.639,1.761
to actually identify a group of people,7000.4,2.799
that you need to protect,7003.199,2.321
so other viruses may not be this way so,7005.52,3.599
might lock down be a good idea like hard,7009.119,3.201
core lockdown for future virus,7012.32,3.04
that's 10 times deadlier but spreads at,7015.36,2.799
the same rate as covid or maybe another,7018.159,2.321
way to ask that is imagine a virus,7020.48,2.239
that's 10 times deadlier what's the,7022.719,1.761
right response,7024.48,1.6
i mean i think it's always going to be,7026.08,1.44
focus protection but the group that,7027.52,2.56
needs the focus protection may change,7030.08,1.92
depending on the biology of the virus,7032.0,2.08
right so the polio,7034.08,1.519
epidemic in the 40s and 50s in the u.s,7035.599,2.881
the the great the people at most risk,7038.48,2.639
were children,7041.119,1.921
we didn't know really at the beginning,7043.04,1.76
there was this vehicle oral spread,7044.8,2.08
and so we did all kinds of crazy things,7046.88,2.64
um,7049.52,0.8
including like spreading spraying ddt in,7050.32,2.319
communities,7052.639,1.52
which was somehow supposed to get rid of,7054.159,1.52
polio um but the focus was on whenever,7055.679,3.52
there was an outbreak they would close a,7059.199,1.281
school down,7060.48,1.44
and that was the right thing to do,7061.92,1.679
because that group that needed,7063.599,1.921
protection,7065.52,1.28
where it was,7066.8,1.359
children and those the disease was,7068.159,1.681
spread we thought in schools,7069.84,3.6
i don't think there's a single formula,7073.44,1.92
that works but there's a single,7075.36,1.92
principle that works right no matter i,7077.28,2.8
can't it's hard to imagine a disease,7080.08,2.0
that's uniformly deadly across every,7082.08,2.88
group and every single person,7084.96,2.08
there's always going to be some group,7087.04,2.559
that's differentially,7089.599,2.64
harmed,7092.239,1.121
uh there's always going to be some group,7093.36,1.279
that's differentially protected and that,7094.639,1.841
that may change over time right so like,7096.48,1.759
the in the uh,7098.239,2.321
in this disease in this epidemic,7100.56,2.72
as people got infected and recovered we,7103.28,2.64
now had a class of people that were,7105.92,1.36
pretty well protected against the,7107.28,1.2
disease,7108.48,2.4
they should be they would like instead,7110.88,1.92
of ostracizing them because they don't,7112.8,1.839
want a vaccine we should we should be,7114.639,2.08
allowing them to work i mean we're,7116.719,1.52
having,7118.239,0.88
staffing shortages in hospitals now,7119.119,2.0
because we forgot that principle,7121.119,2.161
is uh,7123.28,1.12
quite a bit of this a technology problem,7124.4,2.08
so being able to so some of it how much,7126.48,3.36
of it is this uh sociological problem,7129.84,3.68
uh how much of it is a technology,7133.52,1.52
problem,7135.04,1.199
like where do you uh put the blame,7136.239,2.721
sort of on why this didn't go so great,7138.96,2.56
and how it can go great in the beginning,7141.52,2.48
i mean think about lockdowns like if we,7144.0,2.0
didn't have zoom we wouldn't have,7146.0,1.44
lockdowns right there's,7147.44,1.84
there's a reason in 2009 we didn't lock,7149.28,1.919
down i mean we didn't have the,7151.199,1.121
technology to replace work with this,7152.32,1.6
remote,7153.92,0.96
um with this remote technology,7154.88,2.96
so we had good lockdown technology yeah,7157.84,2.64
and zoom we didn't have,7160.48,2.48
good focus protection technology yeah i,7162.96,2.48
mean focus protection is always going to,7165.44,1.12
be complicated especially for something,7166.56,1.44
like this that's spread so easily it's,7168.0,1.52
going to be complicated and i'm i'm very,7169.52,2.88
i'm the last person to say would have,7172.4,1.36
been perfect there's there would have,7173.76,2.0
been people that would have gotten sick,7175.76,1.839
but they got sick anyways the hope was,7177.599,2.0
that if we suppress community spread low,7179.599,2.08
enough,7181.679,1.04
we can protect the vulnerable,7182.719,1.681
that was the hope by lockdown,7184.4,2.64
the reality was that,7187.04,1.92
only a certain class of people were able,7188.96,1.679
to benefit from a lockdown the rest of,7190.639,1.441
society we call them essential workers,7192.08,1.599
had to keep working and they got sick,7193.679,2.0
yeah,7195.679,0.801
and the disease kept spreading it didn't,7196.48,2.08
actually have a substantial effect on,7198.56,1.76
community spread in the in in non,7200.32,3.12
laptop class populations,7203.44,2.4
and also we should probably expand the,7205.84,1.6
class of people who call vulnerable to,7207.44,2.48
those who would suffer who have the,7209.92,3.04
capacity to suffer,7212.96,2.88
given the policies they're you're,7215.84,2.08
weighing,7217.92,1.04
it's very,7218.96,1.36
disingenuous to call the vulnerable just,7220.32,2.56
the people,7222.88,1.2
obviously we had the very specific,7224.08,1.599
meaning but broadly speaking vulnerable,7225.679,3.761
should uh include anybody who can suffer,7229.44,3.199
based on the policies you take in,7232.639,2.241
response to a virus there's something,7234.88,1.52
this is that principle you just said as,7236.4,1.68
i completely agree with is is uh,7238.08,1.68
something i think has been lost,7239.76,2.08
uh,7241.84,0.799
and unfortunately lost right so,7242.639,2.56
the policies themselves,7245.199,2.4
if they have harm those are real,7247.599,3.04
yeah and we shouldn't pretend like,7250.639,1.361
they're not,7252.0,1.36
and and and essentially demonize the,7253.36,2.239
people that that that suffer them,7255.599,2.56
or pretend i mean like us a lot of times,7258.159,2.241
like the depression that we've been,7260.4,1.44
talking about that's,7261.84,1.839
thought of as like not as not so,7263.679,1.52
important but it is important uh and uh,7265.199,3.761
uh especially the the harm to the people,7268.96,2.159
in poor countries it's like been out of,7271.119,2.161
sight item out of mind in much of the,7273.28,2.16
rich parts of the world,7275.44,1.44
once again i've hoped that we,7276.88,2.48
seeing this learning the lessons of,7279.36,1.839
history with the communication tools who,7281.199,1.841
have now will learn this it's like going,7283.04,1.76
to another country and bombing targeted,7284.8,2.56
terrorist locations,7287.36,1.92
and there's going to be some civilians,7289.28,1.68
who die,7290.96,1.04
pretending that that,7292.0,2.159
the child who watches their dad die is,7294.159,3.681
not going to grow up first of all,7297.84,1.759
traumatized but second of all,7299.599,1.6
potentially bring more hate to the world,7301.199,2.561
than uh the hate that you were allegedly,7303.76,2.64
fighting in the first place that's,7306.4,1.279
another sort of,7307.679,1.681
um considering only one kind of harm and,7309.36,3.2
not the full range of harms that are,7312.56,1.599
being caused by your policies you know,7314.159,1.921
like the good return to focus protection,7316.08,2.639
we we still should be following the,7318.719,1.52
policy now for covet and we're not,7320.239,2.48
right so the vaccines,7322.719,2.161
are there's a great shortage in vaccines,7324.88,1.839
you wouldn't know it in the united,7326.719,1.201
states and in rich parts of the world,7327.92,1.759
but in there's a great shortage of,7329.679,1.52
vaccines we're not going to be able to,7331.199,1.121
vaccinate the um most of the like the,7332.32,3.12
entire set of elderly at least and or,7335.44,2.64
larger groups until late 2022.,7338.08,2.88
huge numbers of older people around the,7340.96,2.719
world in poor countries that have not,7343.679,2.161
had not covered recovered yet so they're,7345.84,1.759
still quite vulnerable have not had the,7347.599,1.921
vaccine,7349.52,1.199
and yet we're talking about vaccinating,7350.719,1.361
five-year-olds,7352.08,1.28
yeah,7353.36,1.04
who benefit,7354.4,1.6
if at all from the vaccines of just a,7356.0,1.84
very little bit because they face such a,7357.84,1.52
low risk of harm from covid,7359.36,3.52
well something that's a little bit,7362.88,2.16
near and dear to our specific the two of,7365.04,2.72
our hearts uh so you're at stanford,7367.76,3.439
so stanford recently,7371.199,1.92
announced that they're going back to,7373.119,1.361
virtual,7374.48,1.119
at least for some period of time in,7375.599,2.0
response to the esc maybe you can,7377.599,2.0
clarify but i think it's in response to,7379.599,1.761
the escalated um,7381.36,3.04
holiday phrase it's related to omicron,7384.4,3.44
and uh a few other universities are kind,7387.84,2.64
of like,7390.48,1.199
uh considering back and forth in my,7391.679,2.241
perspective,7393.92,1.279
as somebody who loves in-person lectures,7395.199,3.04
who,7398.239,1.041
um,7399.28,1.2
sees the value of that,7400.48,2.56
to students to young minds,7403.04,2.72
also looking at the data,7405.76,2.72
seems,7408.48,1.6
the,7410.08,0.68
[Music],7410.76,1.399
risk aversion,7412.159,2.08
in university policies around this given,7414.239,3.36
how healthy the student population is,7417.599,3.281
seems not well calibrated let's put it,7420.88,3.44
this way also pathological pathological,7424.32,2.72
is one way to put it given that i,7427.04,2.079
believe depending on the university but,7429.119,1.6
i think,7430.719,0.88
many universities require that the,7431.599,1.761
student body is vaccinated,7433.36,2.0
at this point,7435.36,1.68
so,7437.04,0.88
i think it's a big mistake by stanford,7437.92,2.0
to do this,7439.92,1.12
and um,7441.04,1.76
i i'd like to say that because i just,7442.8,1.6
hope mit doesn't,7444.4,2.88
but what are your thoughts about,7447.28,1.439
everything things,7448.719,1.36
i completely agree with you i think um,7450.079,2.08
we have,7452.159,1.04
failed in our mission,7453.199,1.681
to educate our students,7454.88,2.0
by these this decision uh and i think i,7456.88,2.88
frankly just more broadly i think we,7459.76,1.439
failed generally over the course of the,7461.199,1.841
last year and a half in living up to our,7463.04,2.0
educational mission,7465.04,2.639
the in-person,7467.679,1.361
teaching is vital,7469.04,2.4
for and now i can understand you have,7471.44,2.32
you have older faculty,7473.76,1.76
the principle of focus protection says,7475.52,1.599
provide some alternative teaching,7477.119,1.441
arrangements for them,7478.56,1.599
that makes sense to me,7480.159,2.321
from the kids point of view,7482.48,1.84
they're more harmed by not getting the,7484.32,2.0
education we promised them,7486.32,2.0
than by than by covid,7488.32,3.04
so applying this principle of this focus,7491.36,2.239
protection,7493.599,1.361
let young professors teach in person,7494.96,3.04
this is before the vaccine after the,7498.0,1.36
vaccine let everyone teach in person,7499.36,1.759
yeah this this the part i don't,7501.119,1.281
understand the discussion we're even,7502.4,1.36
having,7503.76,2.08
um,7505.84,1.44
okay let's leave focus protection aside,7507.28,2.56
here because that's a brilliant policy,7509.84,2.319
for perhaps for the future when there's,7512.159,2.0
no vaccine,7514.159,1.52
now with the vaccine i'm i'm,7515.679,2.121
misunderstanding something here because,7517.8,2.6
we're now in a space,7520.4,2.239
that's,7522.639,0.96
psychological not it's no longer about,7523.599,2.961
biology because,7526.56,2.24
uh with the booster shots which i,7528.8,2.16
believe mit is now requiring before,7530.96,2.4
january,7533.36,1.44
with the booster shots the data shows no,7534.8,2.399
matter how old you are the risks are,7537.199,3.121
very low,7540.32,1.44
for um,7541.76,1.28
ending up in a hospital,7543.04,1.679
relative to all the other risks you face,7544.719,2.241
when you're older,7546.96,2.4
i don't i don't understand can you,7549.36,2.4
explain the policy around,7551.76,2.879
closing,7554.639,1.121
a university but also just a,7555.76,2.959
policy about,7558.719,1.52
just being so,7560.239,2.48
uh scared still,7562.719,1.92
in the university setting i think the,7564.639,1.841
universities the great university has,7566.48,1.679
done great harm,7568.159,1.601
by modeling this kind of behavior yes,7569.76,2.72
that to me decided to keep interrupting,7572.48,2.639
but to me the university should be the,7575.119,2.08
beacon of great behavior not not the,7577.199,3.44
beacon of like,7580.639,1.44
scared conservative,7582.079,2.64
let's not mess up,7584.719,1.681
let's not make it pathological it's not,7586.4,1.759
make anybody angry let's it should be a,7588.159,3.361
place to play in the space of ideas yes,7591.52,3.04
so i think um the central problem is,7594.56,3.039
actually related to the central problem,7597.599,1.361
of covet policy more generally,7598.96,2.32
the goal seems to be,7601.28,1.76
to stop the disease from spreading,7603.04,3.199
rather than to reduce the harm from the,7606.239,2.721
disease,7608.96,2.4
if the if the goal is to stop disease,7611.52,1.84
and spreading the sad fact is we have no,7613.36,2.799
technology to stop to accomplish that,7616.159,2.96
at this point yes because like uh it's,7619.119,2.48
already deeply integrated into the human,7621.599,2.48
civilization well i mean it's here,7624.079,2.0
forever right there's a zero survey of,7626.079,2.881
white-tailed deer in the u.s it turns,7628.96,2.32
out 80 percent of white-tailed deer in,7631.28,1.6
the u.s have coveted antibodies,7632.88,2.799
dogs get it cats get it,7635.679,2.161
there's almost certainly human human,7637.84,1.68
animal transmission of it um,7639.52,2.8
i mean presumably i mean i've heard bats,7642.32,1.6
get it apparently,7643.92,1.52
so so you you have uh you have a,7645.44,2.159
situation where you have this disease,7647.599,1.841
that's here to stay yeah and it and the,7649.44,2.239
vaccines don't stop the spread of it the,7651.679,1.681
lockdowns don't stop spread it we have,7653.36,1.68
no technology to stop the spread of it,7655.04,3.199
um and so we're burning the earth trying,7658.239,1.92
to stop do something that's impossible,7660.159,2.801
rather than,7662.96,2.239
working on what's possible,7665.199,2.0
uh and so like you know like letting,7667.199,3.281
regular college happen that's a great,7670.48,1.92
good universities are a wonderful,7672.4,2.719
invention,7675.119,1.201
and it's contributed so much to society,7676.32,2.319
to decide to shut it down,7678.639,2.08
the universities should be fighting,7680.719,1.92
tooth and nail to not be shut down not,7682.639,2.0
the other way around yeah,7684.639,2.401
whatever the mechanisms that uh results,7687.04,2.159
in the universities doing that that's,7689.199,1.44
probably this is me talking it probably,7690.639,2.241
has to do with certain incentives for,7692.88,1.6
the administration probably has to do,7694.48,1.599
with lawyers and legal kinds of things,7696.079,1.761
to,7697.84,0.879
to avoid uh legal trouble but once again,7698.719,4.321
it's when the administration has too,7703.04,1.76
much power and too much uh definition of,7704.8,2.56
what the policy is for the university,7707.36,1.68
that's when you get into trouble the,7709.04,1.84
beauty,7710.88,0.96
the power of the university should be,7711.84,1.68
about the faculty and the students,7713.52,2.719
administration,7716.239,2.241
just gets in the way,7718.48,1.759
get out of the way i mean they can help,7720.239,1.761
organize things they they play some,7722.0,1.76
important role but they certainly do but,7723.76,2.08
they need to remember what the mission,7725.84,1.359
is the mission is not,7727.199,2.241
safety the mission actually university,7729.44,2.639
should be dangerous places you know for,7732.079,1.841
ideas and and and whatnot,7733.92,2.96
what is the role of fear in a pandemic,7736.88,2.16
we've been dancing around it is it,7739.04,1.92
useful is it destructive or is there,7740.96,2.8
sort of a complicated story here because,7743.76,2.319
uh instead of taking us back into,7746.079,1.841
january 2020,7747.92,1.92
there's so much uncertainty this could,7749.84,1.92
have been a pandemic that,7751.76,2.479
um,7754.239,0.88
is black death the bubonic plague it,7755.119,2.721
could have killed,7757.84,1.68
hundreds of millions of people we don't,7759.52,1.76
know that,7761.28,1.2
we're we're very new to this it's been a,7762.48,1.92
while we're rusty,7764.4,2.0
so like there is there is some value to,7766.4,2.4
fear so that you don't do the stupid,7768.8,2.16
thing you don't just go on living i,7770.96,2.08
guess where i come from i think it's,7773.04,1.36
almost entirely counterproductive,7774.4,2.16
i think fear should never be used as a,7776.56,2.639
tactic to manipulate human behavior,7779.199,3.601
by public health so the fear on the,7782.8,2.08
individual level,7784.88,2.16
that feeling of fear you should be very,7787.04,2.24
hesitant about that feeling because it,7789.28,2.08
could be easily manipulated by the,7791.36,1.839
powerful exactly so i think um that fear,7793.199,3.04
is natural,7796.239,1.601
and it it uh it's not something that you,7797.84,2.72
have to you have to nest you have to,7800.56,1.76
stoke to get when the facts on the,7802.32,2.24
ground suggest it,7804.56,1.84
right uh in fact the tendency for humans,7806.4,2.719
in the in the face of,7809.119,2.161
threats from infects disease is to is to,7811.28,2.399
exaggerate the fear in their own minds,7813.679,2.56
of the being contaminated by the,7816.239,2.241
environment and by others that's just,7818.48,2.0
natural to humans,7820.48,2.08
and,7822.56,0.96
the role of public health is not,7823.52,2.159
necessarily to eradicate the fear but,7825.679,2.161
like obviously technological advances,7827.84,1.44
can help eradicate the fear but like but,7829.28,1.76
it's really to help manage that fear,7831.04,2.48
and,7833.52,1.04
and uh help people put the the sort of,7834.56,4.079
incentives that come out of that to,7838.639,1.6
useful things as opposed to harmful,7840.239,1.681
things,7841.92,2.319
what's happened in this pandemic is that,7844.32,2.16
there's been a deliberate policy to,7846.48,1.84
stoke the fear,7848.32,1.44
to help make people think that the,7849.76,1.839
disease is worse than it actually is,7851.599,2.48
in survey after survey you see this,7854.079,2.401
and that's been incredibly damaging so,7856.48,2.56
young people,7859.04,1.44
have readily given away their,7860.48,2.719
willingness participating in regular,7863.199,1.44
life,7864.639,0.801
because a they fear covid more than they,7865.44,2.88
ought,7868.32,1.359
and b they feared that they're going to,7869.679,1.601
harm the vulnerable,7871.28,2.24
in their lives,7873.52,1.599
you put those two together and you just,7875.119,1.6
that you get this powerful demand for,7876.719,1.601
lockdowns you see this all over the,7878.32,1.44
world,7879.76,1.28
broadly speaking you have a powerful,7881.04,1.84
demand for rational policies irrational,7882.88,2.96
policies because i would like to mention,7885.84,1.52
the flip side of that,7887.36,1.68
i've been saddened to see how much money,7889.04,3.599
there is to be made,7892.639,2.08
by the martyrs,7894.719,2.641
the people,7897.36,1.2
the conspiracy theorists,7898.56,2.0
that tell you,7900.56,2.24
you should be afraid of the government,7902.8,3.6
you should be afraid of the man,7906.4,2.719
it feels like fear is the problem i,7909.119,2.56
think there's some guy that once said,7911.679,1.601
something about we should be we should,7913.28,1.6
fear fear itself,7914.88,2.64
uh,7917.52,1.199
he was a president or something i,7918.719,1.281
vaguely remember that,7920.0,1.679
so i i so i'm worried about both sides,7921.679,2.881
here that well i just i think the,7924.56,2.32
general principle is that should not be,7926.88,1.92
a tool of public policy right,7928.8,2.24
right the true the public policy should,7931.04,1.92
attempt and public health policy in,7932.96,1.679
particular should attempt to address,7934.639,1.201
that fear,7935.84,1.12
uh,7936.96,1.279
it's not that you should,7938.239,2.161
tell people lies of course not tell,7940.4,2.56
people accurately what the risk is,7942.96,3.44
give people tools that have evidence,7946.4,2.48
that they can address their risk with,7948.88,2.88
um,7951.76,1.08
and level with people when we don't know,7952.84,3.239
i think that is the right adult way for,7956.079,2.56
to deal with this pandemic from public,7958.639,1.681
health point of view and that's that is,7960.32,2.24
not the policy we have followed instead,7962.56,2.72
public health has intentionally stoked,7965.28,1.68
the fear in order to gain compliance,7966.96,1.92
with his edicts,7968.88,1.52
and i think the consequence of that is,7970.4,3.52
people distrust public health,7973.92,2.56
what you're talking about the distrust,7976.48,1.36
of government i think is a partly a,7977.84,1.6
consequence of that that that movement,7979.44,1.84
which is much smaller once upon a time,7981.28,2.0
is much larger now,7983.28,1.68
because of essentially people look at,7984.96,2.48
what the what public health has done and,7987.44,1.679
said i mean they've lied to me a whole,7989.119,2.401
bunch of times a whole bunch of things,7991.52,1.92
is the general sense and there are,7993.44,2.08
consequences of that,7995.52,1.599
we're going to have to work in public,7997.119,1.361
health for a long time to try to regain,7998.48,2.239
the trust of the public,8000.719,2.081
throughout all of this you've been,8002.8,2.0
inspiring to me to a lot of people,8004.8,2.879
you've been,8007.679,1.601
uh fearless,8009.28,1.68
uh bold,8010.96,1.6
in these kind of challenging the,8012.56,2.0
policies,8014.56,1.44
and not in in a martyr kind of way,8016.0,2.96
because you're walking,8018.96,1.84
the line gracefully and beautifully i,8020.8,2.08
would say,8022.88,1.52
and,8024.4,1.6
looking at that,8026.0,1.92
i think you're an inspiration to a lot,8027.92,1.6
of young people so i have to ask what,8029.52,2.4
advice would you give them,8031.92,1.92
if they're thinking of going into,8033.84,1.68
science if they're thinking of having an,8035.52,3.04
impact in the world what advice would,8038.56,1.44
you give them about,8040.0,1.679
their career,8041.679,2.0
and maybe about their life thinking,8043.679,2.4
about somebody in high school maybe an,8046.079,1.921
undergraduate college i'd say a few,8048.0,2.159
things one is this is a wonderful,8050.159,2.08
profession you have an opportunity to,8052.239,2.96
improve the lives of so many and do it,8055.199,2.4
by having fun,8057.599,1.52
the kind of play we're talking about,8059.119,1.681
it's an absolute privilege,8060.8,2.24
to be able to work in this kind of area,8063.04,2.48
um,8065.52,0.88
uh and to young people looking to say,8066.4,2.08
that that have,8068.48,1.52
some gifts or desired for for this area,8070.0,2.639
i say please you know,8072.639,1.761
go for it like do serious science,8074.4,2.48
broadly yeah i mean it could be it could,8076.88,2.239
be i mean i'm not i don't have any gifts,8079.119,1.6
in ai but like you know it could be your,8080.719,1.281
buddy but you know or in health or or in,8082.0,2.4
medicine or whatever whatever your gifts,8084.4,2.48
lie develop them work hard and develop,8086.88,2.16
them because it's worth it it's worth it,8089.04,1.52
not just um,8090.56,1.92
not just because you get some status but,8092.48,2.0
because the the journey is fun,8094.48,2.32
and the result is uh improvement to the,8096.8,2.319
lives of so many so i think that that is,8099.119,2.401
the encouragement i give i'd also say if,8101.52,2.88
you're looking at this ugliness of this,8104.4,1.759
debate that's happened over the pandemic,8106.159,2.96
i i'd say to young people we need you to,8109.119,2.241
come come in and help transform it many,8111.36,2.56
of the people you see in this debate,8113.92,1.04
that behave poorly,8114.96,2.0
i actually forgive them i've done my,8116.96,2.159
best to try,8119.119,1.361
um,8120.48,1.199
because,8121.679,0.881
their act their many of them are acting,8122.56,1.84
out of their own sense that they're that,8124.4,2.0
they need to do good but they've but the,8126.4,1.92
mistake they've made is is in in is in,8128.32,2.399
this arrogance and this power but when,8130.719,1.841
you come in remember that example as a,8132.56,1.76
negative example and so that you when,8134.32,2.16
you join the debate,8136.48,1.759
you'll join it in a spirit of humility,8138.239,2.081
in the spirit of trying to learn um,8140.32,2.0
while keeping that that love of,8142.32,2.56
that led you to enter the field in the,8144.88,1.759
first place,8146.639,1.52
and yeah,8148.159,1.52
choose forgiveness versus like derision,8149.679,2.541
[Music],8152.22,1.06
um,8153.28,1.04
like the people that,8154.32,1.6
you know have messed up like give them a,8155.92,2.319
pass,8158.239,1.041
because that's how,8159.28,1.6
it feels like that's how improvement,8160.88,1.52
starts funny i've been thinking this,8162.4,1.92
it's like uh,8164.32,1.2
i told you i'm christian right so like i,8165.52,1.92
thought like god has given me many,8167.44,2.0
opportunities to forgive people learn,8169.44,2.0
learn to practice how to do that give,8171.44,1.279
you a gift it's a very humbling thing i,8172.719,2.0
guess,8174.719,0.721
is there a,8175.44,1.4
memory,8176.84,1.56
from when you were young that was very,8178.4,2.16
formative to you,8180.56,1.599
so you just gave advice to some young,8182.159,1.761
people is there something that stands,8183.92,1.679
out to you that uh,8185.599,3.281
a decision you made an event that,8188.88,2.319
happened that made you the man you are,8191.199,2.32
today,8193.519,1.84
i actually grew up in a relatively poor,8195.359,2.401
environment like i was born in india,8197.76,2.558
and i moved when i was four,8200.318,2.32
my dad had uh eight brothers and sisters,8202.638,3.522
and my mom had four brothers and sisters,8206.16,2.158
she uh grew up in the salomon in,8208.318,2.4
calcutta,8210.718,1.522
my dad his dad died when he was young,8212.24,2.478
and he supported his family his kid his,8214.718,1.68
brothers and sisters with university,8216.398,1.281
scholarship money,8217.679,1.361
came to the u.s and my dad worked,8219.04,2.559
in a mcdonald's even though he's an,8221.599,1.2
electrical engineer couldn't find a job,8222.799,2.08
in 1971 and so he worked at mcdonald's,8224.879,3.679
um we lived in a in a uh like this this,8228.558,3.282
basically like this the housing port,8231.84,2.4
like development uh in in in cambridge,8234.24,2.639
this like this middle building of the,8236.879,1.361
17th floor of this like housing,8238.24,1.279
development,8239.519,1.039
um,8240.558,0.881
i mean i i think that was transformative,8241.439,3.039
for me like i didn't realize so much at,8244.478,2.16
the time how that experience of being,8246.638,3.522
essentially like,8250.16,1.6
poor lower middle class,8251.76,1.839
what effect it had on my outlook,8253.599,2.561
you mentioned to me offline that you,8256.16,1.359
listened to a conversation that i had,8257.519,1.92
with my dad what what impact did your,8259.439,2.0
dad have in your life what uh what,8261.439,2.0
memories do you have about him he was a,8263.439,2.08
rocket scientist actually,8265.519,1.84
he,8267.359,1.279
helped design rocket guidance systems he,8268.638,2.321
died when i was 20,8270.959,2.0
and i still miss him to this day,8272.959,2.241
and i think that,8275.2,1.438
experience of seeing him,8276.638,2.08
sacrifice,8278.718,1.282
his hidden self for his family,8280.0,3.599
a brilliant man but uh in many ways,8283.599,2.401
frustrated with like the the his,8286.0,2.0
opportunities in the world which,8288.0,1.28
publicly would let him to come to the,8289.28,1.118
u.s in the first place,8290.398,2.32
that's,8292.718,1.122
transformed that's had a transformative,8293.84,1.599
effect on me and i wish i could tell him,8295.439,2.0
that,8297.439,0.959
looking back,8298.398,2.641
do you,8301.519,1.681
think about your own mortality do you,8303.2,2.159
think about your death your dad is no,8305.359,2.24
longer with us,8307.599,1.681
you're the,8309.28,1.519
the old wise sage,8310.799,2.56
that represents it's funny,8313.359,2.32
i've only,8315.679,1.2
worried about death uh once in this,8316.879,2.241
pandemic although i've had two of my,8319.12,2.08
cousin,8321.2,0.88
who was 73 and my my uncle was 74 die,8322.08,4.0
in india during the pandemic and i,8326.08,2.08
grieved them both from covid um,8328.16,4.478
like the fear of covid really has only,8332.638,1.84
hit me,8334.478,0.961
only really literally once during this,8335.439,1.841
it wasn't for me,8337.28,1.92
and i recognized it's irrational so on,8339.2,2.08
the eve of the santa clara county zero,8341.28,2.48
prevalent study,8343.76,1.44
um it was it was a really interesting,8345.2,2.399
thing because so many people volunteered,8347.599,2.0
to help,8349.599,1.521
and um my my my daughter,8351.12,2.88
who's 20 she was i guess was 19 at the,8354.0,2.318
time and my wife also volunteered to,8356.318,1.762
help with like various aspects of the,8358.08,2.0
study and so the eve of the study they,8360.08,2.0
were going to go out in public,8362.08,1.92
and i didn't know what the death rate,8364.0,1.359
was because we hadn't done the study,8365.359,2.32
and i suspected it was lower than people,8367.679,2.081
were saying but i didn't know,8369.76,1.759
i knew,8371.519,1.199
about the age gradient because i'd seen,8372.718,1.6
the chinese data,8374.318,1.361
and my my daughter is young but my wife,8375.679,2.0
is my age,8377.679,1.361
and i didn't know the death rate,8379.04,1.759
and i couldn't sleep the night before,8380.799,2.64
like what if i'm putting my family,8383.439,2.401
my kid my daughter and my wife at risk,8385.84,2.718
because of some some activity that i'm,8388.558,1.921
doing,8390.479,1.121
um it was kind of i don't know i mean it,8391.6,1.92
was so worried about the well-being,8393.52,3.36
and of others yeah when you look in the,8396.88,2.72
mirror i if i die i die i mean like i,8399.6,2.24
just it's not i again i'm christian so i,8401.84,2.479
don't death is not the end for me uh i,8404.319,2.401
believe um and so i don't i don't,8406.72,2.0
particularly worried about my own death,8408.72,1.679
but i i do,8410.399,2.561
i mean i just i think we can't help but,8412.96,1.439
we worry about the the well-being of our,8414.399,1.521
loved ones,8415.92,1.6
so,8417.52,1.68
from the perspective of god then let me,8419.2,2.08
ask you um,8421.28,1.92
what do you think is the meaning of this,8423.2,1.44
whole journey we're on what do you think,8424.64,1.52
is the meaning of life,8426.16,1.68
no it's very simple love one another,8427.84,2.8
treat your neighbor as yourself,8430.64,1.839
it's love yeah simple as that,8432.479,3.121
well i'd love to see a little bit more,8435.6,2.0
of that in this pandemic,8437.6,2.24
it's an opportunity for the best,8439.84,2.88
of our nature to shine it's so i've seen,8442.72,2.4
some of the worst,8445.12,1.92
um but i think some of that is just good,8447.04,2.0
therapy and uh i'm hoping in the end,8449.04,3.2
what we have here is uh is love at the,8452.24,2.88
very least,8455.12,1.199
make your dad proud with some,8456.319,2.16
incredible rockets,8458.479,2.241
that we're launching i think you get,8460.72,1.36
along well with my dad lex,8462.08,2.319
i definitely would,8464.399,1.361
thank you so much this is an incredible,8465.76,1.92
